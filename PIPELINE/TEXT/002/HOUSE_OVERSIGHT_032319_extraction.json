We processed 11 million tweets this week for Trump and 50.03% are \npositive and only 20.66% are negative whereas Clinton is 56.05% negative and 20.03% positive. \nWe are trying to correlate that into popular vote outcome and electoral votes received. \nRegards, \nZubair \nOn Sep 15, 2016, at 5:15 AM, Zubair Khan wrote: \nHi Jeffrey, \nWe are in the process of removing data from bots and making a clean report which I will share with you in few \nhours.
