He seems very interested in \nyour relationship with the news media. I told him you were a hell of a guy:) One oddity: he said he had \nbeen told that that quote from Trump about you in the original NY Mag story had been manufactured. \nie, that I did not actually speak to Donald. Which is bull shit of course. I am sure that is what Trump \ntold him as they have been getting a lot of questions from reporters about you. \nHe actually seemed to be a sensible guy/solid reporter -- just from the few conversations I had with \nhim. I think he is close to finishing up. \nDid you ever speak to him? \nLandon Thomas, Jr. \nFinancial Reporter \nNew York Times \nhttp://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/landon jr thomas/index.h  \ntml \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032264 \n"
