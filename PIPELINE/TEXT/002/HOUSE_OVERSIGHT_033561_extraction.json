Through gaps in the \ngreenery appear stone fountains, elephant statues, pools the size of tennis complexes (next to actual \ntennis complexes), and more clay roofs than one could count. It's a monumental display of wealth, and it \nis rapidly expanding, not just here but in Delray Beach, Jupiter, Palm Beach Gardens and Boca Raton, as \nmoney pours out of the Northeast (and in some cases, from as far as London and Singapore) and into this \nalready wealthy section of southeast Florida. Approximately 70 hedge and private equity funds are now \nheadquartered here, many of which have set up shop in the last two years, jacking up home prices and \nspurring a countywide initiative to become, as some have said, \"the new Greenwich.\" \nFor hedge fund managers who might normally be inclined toward Westchester or Connecticut, the allure of \nSouth Florida is as plain as grits on toast. The homes are sprawling; the Intracoastal Waterway is a \nyachter's paradise. It has a glittering social scene. During high season—October through March—there \nmight be several fundraisers on any given night. Perhaps the key factor, however: In Florida, there are \nno individual income taxes, no estate taxes and no capital gains taxes. A hedge fund manager reporting $1 \nmillion in income can expect to pay only the federal government, whereas his counterpart living in \nConnecticut pays that plus an extra $67,000. And if the poor schmuck were still in New York City? He'd \nbetter be ready to fork over $104,300. \nAs for why all of this is happening now, when Florida has long been a sunny tax haven, so to speak, \nfinanciers point to the upcoming application of Section 457A of the Internal Revenue Code. Before 457A \nwas enacted, certain fees and related earnings could grow tax deferred in offshore accounts for up to ten \nyears. But now, according to the section, hedge fund managers will need to funnel all of the fees that \nwere deferred before 2009 and their related earnings back into the U.S. by 2017. If a manager lives in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033561 \nFlorida when this happens, he's much less likely to pay exorbitant state taxes on the whole amount. If he \nstill lived in New York City? Fuggedaboudit. \nIt's the job of Kelly Smallridge, president and CEO of the Palm Beach Business Development Board, to \nensure that hedge fund and private equity managers are informed of these benefits, in the hopes that \nthey, and their firms, will become Palm Beach County's newest residents. She's developed a red-carpet \ntour that goes beyond looking at office space and real estate to include meeting headmasters at private \nschools, the school-district superintendent and the mayor and speaking with the governor's staff and CEOs \nwho have moved their operations here. Plus, of course, a few nights on the town. \nIn the winter, when the well-to-do from all over the Northeast visit Florida for charity balls, the board \nhosts dinners and parties for prospective relocators and local captains of industry. Last year, \nSmallridge and company sponsored a soiree aboard a $70 million yacht that featured Veuve Clicquot, caviar \nand live jazz. Guests—who included the CEOs of a national IT company, a major finance company and a land \ndeveloper, venture capitalists, hedge fund managers and the creator of Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage \ndivision—took private tours with the captain of the yacht. \nSmallridge is also working with former hedge fund CIO Dr. Rainford Knight to develop a club for local \ninvestment managers called SocialAlpha that encourages bankers in Palm Beach County's ritzy social scene \nto get to know each other. Even Florida governor Rick Scott has gotten involved, sending personal letters \nto friends and prospects from the Northeast (the governor is a former Greenwich resident and businessman) \nto convince them of Florida's merits. \nSmallridge and Governor Scott are hoping to induce a snowball effect, and so far, it seems to be working. \nEvery financier who moves south chips away at the primary reason to remain near New York City—the fact \nthat everyone else is there. That's not to say it's been easy. Florida is still Florida, and popular \nopinion has not been kind. Even Palm Beach, which has for the most part dodged the insults hurled at the \nrest of the state, is known for its residents' apocalyptically bad driving and worse Hawaiian shirts. \n\"There was a fair amount of trepidation,\" says Al Rabil III, managing partner and CEO of Kayne Anderson \nReal Estate Advisors, who made the move from Armonk, New York, with 20 coworkers this summer. \"But once \neverybody got past the stereotypes and actually came and looked, that changed.\" He says most of his \nemployees weren't looking for bottle service and models anyway. The majority of those who have reached \nthe upper echelons of financial management are married with children, and the appeal of a semi-tropical \nparadise with luxury restaurants, year-round recreation, and sophisticated socializing in a community far \nmore tight-knit than Manhattan (yes, that'sDonald Trump over there) is not lost on them. \nPorter's tour of Billionaire's Row was part of a modified version of one of the Business Development \nBoard's red-carpet tours that I took as part of researching this story. I ate breakfast at the clubby Top \nof the Point restaurant with some of the area's prominent financiers. A waiter in a captain's outfit \nserved lobster rolls while a CPA, a lawyer and the executive director of the Palm Beach County Education \nCommission touted the area's benefits. I surveyed real estate and office space surrounded by miles of \nwater without once having my foot stepped on by a tourist. You can see how all this might sway someone \nwho's on the fence. \nExploring the sugary beaches of South Florida, one starts to wonder why Wall Streeters would be on the \nfence at all. Between the smiling locals and the shopping on Worth Avenue, the Hiaasen-esque stereotypes \nrecede. What remains are the facts: Take-home pay is higher, commutes are shorter, and it's just as \nfabulous as Manhattan, at least for four months of the year. Meanwhile, no one in Florida even owns an \nice scraper. With the Internet allowing more and more money managers to perform their work from nearly \nanywhere, there are few reasons not to make the move. \n\"Initially, it was a way to play golf and keep the wife and kids happy,\" says Brett Langbert, managing \ndirector and head of sales at I.A. Englander & Co. \"But once we moved down, it became a quality-of-life \nissue. There are unlimited things the kids can do outside. I have to tell you, my wife and I are so happy \nwe haven't had to go to one of those indoor bouncy-castle places since we got here.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033562 \n"
