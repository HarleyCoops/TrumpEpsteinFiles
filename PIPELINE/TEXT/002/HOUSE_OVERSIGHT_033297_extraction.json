Clinton, who is also a former U.S. senator and former first lady, mocked this. \n\"He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia,\" she said to loud \nlaughter. \nTrump has talked tough on foreign policy. He has said he would bring back waterboarding and other brutal \ninterrogation techniques for terrorism suspects that are widely regarded as torture and were discontinued by \nDemocratic President Barack Obama. \nHe has also vowed to renegotiate trade deals, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, and \nsaid he would ask members of the 28-nation NATO alliance to \"pay up\" or \"get out.\" \nTrump has criticized Clinton for her handling of foreign policy during her 2009-2013 stint as foreign secretary, \nincluding the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamist militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that \nkilled the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. \nHe cites Clinton's support for the Iraq war - launched by former Republican President George W. Bush - as \nanother example of her shortcomings. \nAt a rally Wednesday night in Sacramento, California, Trump said he had seen a copy of Clinton's speech and \n\"it was such lies about my foreign policy.\" \nSent from my iPhone \nNOTE: This e-mail message is subject to the Dubai World Group disclaimer see http://www.dubaiworld.ae/email disclaimer \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033297 \n"
