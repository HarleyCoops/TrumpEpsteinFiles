It would be great if I could get this back \ntomorrow. Nothing is due until the recap is complete, hopefully in about 4 weeks. I am planning to start those \ndiscussions the end of next week. \nThings are going well. The more I learn the more excited I get. I will be at Tarana tomorrow \ndiscussing a window mount version to try to get to self-install. lgbps in a self-install package would be the last \nstep. \nWe will only need a tower ever 4-5km in the city, which is basically 2 or 3 rooftops for all of Boston. \nI met with American Tower today (I know their CEO and CTO) and they have plenty of room on the John \nHancock. \nFun Stuff and great to be doing something together! \nGreg \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032725 \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
