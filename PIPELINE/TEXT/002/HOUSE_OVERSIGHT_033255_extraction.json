Here's my (only slightly out of date) professional web presence, including \nLetterman clip: \nwww.thedylanlove.com  \nHere are a few stories I've written more recently that are not displayed on my site: \nhttps://www.inverse.com/article/33173-virtual-reality-psychedelic-drugs  \nhttps://www.inverse.com/article/11766-how-instant-translation-tech-will-change-the-way-the-world-talks-and-listens \nhttps://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/09/14/russians-use-technology-influence-elections  \nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/quantum-technologies-conference-2017-8  \nYou might get a special kick out of this Trump story: \nhttps://www.inverse.com/article/20029-transhumanist-presidential-candidate-zoltan-istvan-donald-trump-new-technologies \nWhat kinds of media goals/story ideas are interesting to you? Masha has made it clear that she wants me to write \nsomething about you, but that's much more your call to make. I suggest that there is mileage to be gained by quoting you \nin a story about how proper implementation of cryptocurrency might solve financial corruption issues. \nI travel back to Austin, Texas tomorrow evening, but am of course reachable. Thanks again for your time this morning. \n-Dylan \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033255 \n"
