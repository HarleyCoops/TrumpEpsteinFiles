    "full_text": "From: jeffrey E. [jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSent: 10/30/2014 2:50:38 AM \nTo: Nil Priell Barak \nSubject: Re: \nbegining edits \nDavid Ben Gurion was asked why he, after 2000 \nyears, in contrast to the many great leaders in \nthe past was uniquely able to re -established the \nState of Israel. BG responded that he thought that \nit must have been true that in ancient times people \nhad been born with a sixth sense. The one \nenabling individuals to have the ability \nto recognize and the seize opportunities. Though \nfew of those individuals remain I think I am one of \nthe fortunate few. He didn't mentioned the horrors \nor the sacrifice of the 48' war. I believe \nMenachem Begin had it,as several years after the \nbitter 73' war he was able to make a daring \npeace with Egypt. Als lzhak Rabin,who now 20yrs \nago, signed the Peace treaty with Jordan though \nin amidst a wave of terror. He faced huge internal \nrejection but it began the first baby steps towards \na settlement with the Palestinians. As we all know \nhe was assassinated by a Jewish terrorist. These \nleaders all faced many risks, yet were able to see \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032162 \nand seize an opportunity. Statesmanship and \nleadership.. \nDuring the last three years we have been living \nthrough a geo political earthquake. The world \norder, which existed since the demise of the \nOttoman Empire, is collapsing.The Arab Spring \nappears to have turned into an Islamist Winter. \nBorders are erased. Old tribal and sectarian \ndisputes have awakened. In perfect storm like \nfashion Israel now finds itself surrounded by \nclashes of civilizations, in addition to the Islam \nconfrontation between fanatic terror and moderna, \nSuna and Shia, the legacy threats: Iran, Assad in \nSyria, Hezbullah in Lebanon,Hamas in Gaza are \nall still active and worrying. \nwe have to be alert and ready to strongly respond \nto any threat to our security.. \nBut I believe new opportunities are there for the \ntaking. This opportunity,which might not occur \nagain for generations ,is the potential to reshape \nour relationships with the Arab Moderates based \non our common concerns. Extremism, Terror and \nIran. This could open the gate to a more peaceful \nMiddle East based on cooperation and synergies \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032163 \nrather than blood and revenge. However thers is, \nin my opnion n o way to achieve but to move \nforward with the Palestinians \nA precondition to seize such an opportunity is a \nmighty, sober, self confident Israel, in strong \nalliance with the US. An Israel which can deter or \ndefeat any combination of regional powers, yet, an \nIsrael who is ready to contemplate and consider a \nmodified Saudi or Arab League Plan as a basis for \nnegotiations. \nThe unique relationship we have developed with \nthe US over the last 45yrs based on common \nvalues ,mutual respect and shared interests is a \ncornerstone of our strength, world posture and \nour future. It is also a crucial building block of any \nregional peace and cooperation strategy.Allowing \nIL/US relations to remain damaged, I believe is a \ngrave mistake with potentially far reaching \nconsequences. \nAs the Minister of Defense of Israel I've met more \nthan once with President Obama , as well as with \nPresident Bush before him„ reiterating with both \nthat the though the US is clearly our best friend \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032164 \nand ally, Israel is a Sovereign state and when our \nsecurity and the future of Israel and the Jewish \npeople are at stake we might need to take \ntough decisions on our own. We cannot and will \nnot, I added, delegate the responsibility for such \ndecisions to even our best friends ,. We respect \nthe fact that we might have different views. \nAmerican Presidents have always understood that \n. We also must have the same respect when the \nUS decides it is its interest to take decisions we \nmight not fully agree with. \nthis relation is of course not fully symmetric. It is \nthe US which will provides Israel with the new F-\n35s and ensures the Qualitative Edge of the IDF \nvis a vis any combination of neighbors. It is the \nUS who significantly financed the Iron Dome, \nArrow and David's Sling missile defense systems. \nIt is the US that has commited to defend Israel in \nthe event of a missile attack from Iran. \nWe should never forget it. \nThe recent spurt of verbal exchanges is a \nworrying signal that something has gone wrong. It \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032165 \nneeds corrrection.. Netanyahu is not a coward. \nI've seen him as a young special forces \nofficer ,under my command, facing fire directly and \ntaking risks to his life. A very courageous soldier. \nThat will never change. cheap words serve little \npurpose .The same applies to President Obama \nand Secretary Kerry. they are not enemies of \nIsrael. they are Good Friends. Kerry has exhibited \ndecades long support for Israel. Since he became \nSecretary of State he has invested his time \nenergy and prestige trying to help Israel and the \nPalestinians to bridge disputes and reach a \nbreakthrough. it was a noble effort which \nshould justify thanks rather than accustations. We \nare of course concerned by the lack of outcome of \nthe P5+1 negotiations with Iran and we think that \nthe chemical weapons removal from Syria could \nhave been handled differently But President \nObama strengthens the legacy of Presidential \nsupport for Israel.. Israel has a vital interest in \nresuming the healthy trust, and mutual respect \nthat existed until recently. \n. I believe that the most profound internal debate \ninside Israel today is in regard to the relationship \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032166 \nbetween Israel's security needs and the viability of \nthe \"two states solution\". We all agree that we are \nliving in a tough, merciless and highly \nunpredictable neighborhood..So it is clear that our \nsecurity needs are of the highest priority and we \nshould build certain \"safety margins\" into any \nfuture security planning.But the Israeli Right is \ngoing too far by arguing that the security needs of \nIsrael renders any viable,demilitarized \nindependent, Palestinian State - impossible. \nIn other words, the \" lesson\" of recent years \naccording to our Right is that Israel's Security and \nthe \"two states solution\" are incompatible. I believe \nthis is a fallacious conclusion, driven by narrow \npolitical interests. \nI've served a lifetime career, fighting and \ndefending my country's security. Most of the time \nin uniform. Based on this experience ,I confidently \nconclude,and it is a professional rather than \npolitical answer, that if and when a Palestinian \ndemilitarized independent State will be established \nside by side with Israel behind borders which will \nconsist of a solid Jewish majority for generations \nto come and will include the major \"Settlement \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032167 \nBlocks\" accompanied by mutually agreed swaps \nand an Israeli long term military presence along \nthe River Jordan - the IDF and the \nSecurityServices will be capable \nof defending Israel. Moreover, I'm confident that \nif we will bring together all former Israeli Chiefs of \nStaff, all former Commanders of the Central \nCommand( responsible for Judea and Samaria) \nand all former Heads of Intelligence ,SecServices \nand Mossad, an extremely vast majority of them \nwill agree with me on this issue. True,it might take \ntime, frustrations and setbacks. It might have to go \nthrough prolonged periods of interim \narrangements. but the IDF is much superior to any \nconceivable rival and will be able to defend Israel \nunder all those circumstances. \nthe Right argument is convoluted, the opposite is \ntrue. The real big threat to the Zionist Project is not \nthe \"two state solution\" but rather the \"one state \nsolution\" which will lead inevitably to either a non \nJewish or a non democratic, potentially ever \nbleeding State. Still,this is the vision the Israeli \nextreme Right shares unknowingly with the Hamas \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032168 \n(and with all due differences with the lunatic, Post \nZionist fringes of the Israeli Left). \nIn order to seize the opportunity for regional peace \nand cooperation arrangements and in order to \nblock the deterioration towards \"one state solution\" \naction, tenacity and decisiveness will be essential. \npolitics of survival, anxiety and pessimism will not \ndo. \nwe are facing a moment of truth. a time for daring \ndecisions.The essence of Zionism, its raison d'être \nhad always been to take our fate in our hands. \nmake decisions and follow them with actions, \nrather than being dragged by events and decisions \nof others and paying the price for it. \nour legendary Foreign Minister Abba Eban \nfamously said that the Palestinians had never \nmissed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Lets \nnot fall into the same trap. \nOn Wed, Oct 29, 2014 at 7:12 PM, Nil Priell Barak \nherewith the Op Ed.
