Air Force One \nView this email in your browser here. \nChart of the Day - Economy and Society \nJune 27, 2016 \nDear Barry, \nWhen it comes to describing Donald Trump's private jet, the word \n\"impressive\" would be an understatement. The presumptive Republican Party \nnominee bought the Boeing 757-200 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen \nand he spared no expense kitting it out. Dubbed \"Trump Force One,\" the \nluxurious jet is equipped with a shower, gold-plated seatbelt buckles and a \n52-inch flatscreen with a library of 1,000 movies. Built in 1991, the 757 is \nestimated to have cost approximately $100 million. If Trump reaches the \nWhite House in November, he'll have to exchange his personal jet for the \npresidential fleet, two highly modified Boeing 747-200Bs. The aircraft used by \nthe president were built in 1986 and operate with the Air Force One callsign \nwhen the president is onboard. Will switching jets prove one of Trump's few \nregrets if he becomes president? \nEven though it cannot boast gold-plated accessories, Air Force One is a \nlarger aircraft, seating 70 passengers in comfort compared to Trump Force \n..11141, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033301 \nOne's 43. The presidential jet is also slightly faster with a range of about \n6,800 nautical miles compared to 4,100 for a 757. A VC-25A can also be \nrefuelled in mid-air by a tanker, extending its range even further. \nThe two presidential planes cost $325 million each and their cost of operation \ncomes to $179,750 per hour. The hourly cost of operation for a standard 757 \nis just over $8,000 by comparison, though the taxpayer will pick up the higher \nbill for Air Force One. All that bling certainly inflated the cost of Trump Force \nOne but Air Force One is expensive because it's packed with equipment and \nfacilities to keep the president and his or her entourage safe at all times. \nThere is a hospital onboard, electronic countermeasures and heavy shielding \nto afford protection in the event of an electromagnetic pulse during a nuclear \nattack. All in all, if Trump does end up travelling regularly on Air Force One, \nhe probably won't regret trading in his gold seatbelt buckle for the presidential \nsuite on one of the most sophisticated airliners in the world. \nhttps://www.statista.com/chart/5110/trump-force-one-vs-air-force-one/ \n+++ Advertisement ++ \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033302 \n6 Best Practices for Creating Effective Dashboards \nIf you're not using interactive dashboards to make fast data-driven decisions, \nyou're missing out!
