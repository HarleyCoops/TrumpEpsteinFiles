Now dershowitz isn't involved; rather he is a high powered \nlawyer. I didn't know you also had lefkowitz. I met the guy once when a prospective client asked me to try a \ncase with him. One meeting was enough for me to see clearly that that would not have worked out well; but he \napparemtly is a successful lawyer. \nOne thing for sure the article gets wrong - that the \"victims\" were silenced. \nHope you are doing well. \nDavid \nReport: Trump aide helped sex abuser get cushy plea deal \nhttps://aol.it/2BDSk01 \nVP:47 \nShared via the AOL App \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033419 \n"
