Nothing has \nchanged regarding their core business. Data center spending is not going to change based off this M&A transaction. \nHowever if I am wrong and the market further penalizes the stock at least our losses are contained. The stock has \ndropped $40 and I think we could easily recoup our premium if the market buys into the CEO's reason for the merger. \nIf I never had a position I would absolutely buy the stock using options. I would be selling October $185 puts and buying \nOct $220 calls costing 50c/share. \nPaul \nPaul Barrett \nAlpha Group Capital LLC \n142 W 57th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10019 \nALPHA GROUP \nCAPITAL \nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 2:18 PM \nTo: Paul Barrett \nCc: Richard Kahn \nSubject: Re: AVGO \nAgain?? How many puts ? What are the alternatives. The fact tgat you iwn thd stock at a higher price is affecting your \ndecision. Sorry. This is judt ridiculous!!! Would you buy the stock here .7777 If you would would you also buy puts \n???

The stock is \nnow down 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding mergers. So I think \nit makes sense to keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we hopefully get more clarity from \nmanagement. \nPaul Barrett \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031818 \nAlpha Group Capital LLC \n142 W 57th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10019 \nalALPHA GROUP \nCAPITAL \nI \nI \nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 1:55 PM \nTo: Paul Barrett \nCc: Richard Kahn <:_____________________________________ \nSubject: Re: AVGO \nlye had enough!!!!

I have some ideas which I will \nsend you over the weekend if that is OK. \nRe Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been a lot of \nfocus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we hear from \nmanagement as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031819 \nThis morning the pricing is as follows: \nAug 200 Puts cost $4.10 \nSept 200 Puts cost $7.90 \nEarning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept puts. \nHowever I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management before August expiry. \nPaul \nPaul Barrett \nAlpha Group Capital LLC \n142 W 57th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10019 \na \nALPHA GROUP \nCAPITAL \nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 7:11 AM \nTo: Paul Barrett \nSubject: \nRichard Kahn \nIm not angry, sorry, it is sad. it is apparent that you have no experience trading. we both made a mistake. . the \nspy trades were the results of a rank amatuer.. you took a postion on the direction of the market. ok. you \ndecided to play it extra short time and short. . why? becaue the options are cheaper. ? knowing full well that \ntime premium was running. . first silly move. .
