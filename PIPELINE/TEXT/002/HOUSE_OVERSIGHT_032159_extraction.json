Strive Masiyiwa (right) with Bill Clinton and his\ndaughter\nNEW ZIMBABWE 19-08-2014\nSPEAKING at a microfinance symposium in Turin, Italy, recently, Econet Wireless founder\nStrive Masiyiwa recalled the ruling by the judge who gave him a licence in 1998 saying that\n“70 percent of people in the country had never heard a telephone ring”\nThe licence was granted after a costly five-year legal battle against the government.\nAccording to the UK-based Guardian newspaper Masiyiwa told the Turin gathering that\n“today, 75 percent of people [in Zimbabwe] have a cell phone; and I want 75 percent of the\npeople in Africa to have a bank account … on a mobile phone.” Not only that, Econet\nWireless has since grown into a diversified technology and financial services group with\noperations in 17 countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and\nNew Zealand.\nAnother problem, and opportunity, arose when the government ditched the Zimbabwe dollar\nin 2009 for more stable foreign currencies. The transacting public, having struggled with\nhuge amounts of worthless cash in the hyperinflation years, welcomed the decision. But with\nthe country’s productive and export sectors all but collapsed, there just wasn’t enough of the\nforeign currencies in circulation.\n“If you wanted to buy a packet of sweets for your child, you couldn’t get change,” said\nMasiyiwa. Econet intervened with a mobile payments system which has set Zimbabwe on\ncourse to become Africa’s first cashless economy. “Today 43 percent of the GDP moves\nthrough Econet Wireless,” said the telecoms mogul. Explained Econet’s chief executive,\nDouglas Mboweni , recently said: “We do not expect anyone to still be using paper money in\na year’s time. It will be just like Europe or America, where you no longer see people carrying\nbundles of cash.”\nMasiyiwa told the Guardian that his next challenge is to create a product that allows people\nwho are informally employed, such as smallholder farmers and casual workers, to access\ncredit. “In Africa 70 percent of people are informally employed,” he says. “The big frontier for\nus is to create platforms where those people can access credit.” There is little risk that they\nwill get into unmanageable debt because the banks won’t extend excessive credit, calling\nthe system “self-regulating”.\n“We’re trying to build up a savings culture where people are encouraged to save, even if\nthey only have a dollar – for children’s school fees, for transport, for the doctor. A savings\nand credit infrastructure builds resilience.” However, in order to reach the unbanked,\nfinancial institutions – and telecommunications companies – must design services that are\npractical, simple and affordable. “I’ve got a customer who has a dollar in his pocket and has\ngot to decide to have some lunch, call his cousin or go to the doctor,” he said.\n“We have to develop services with sensitivity to the fact that in Africa our customers don’t\nhave the same disposable income as in New Zealand, for example.” It would however, be a\nmistake to assume the poorest behave differently to other customers. “Their behaviour and\naspirations are no different from those who have higher incomes,” cautioned Masiyiwa.\n“They want to use Facebook. They want to use WhatsApp. We have to find ways for them to\naccess those things with their very low income.”\nThe UK Guardian 19-08-2014\n- Will Zimbabwe be Africa’s first cashless society? Telecommunications company, and now\nmobile banking service, Econet Wireless predicts that in less than 12 months notes and\ncoins will be long-gone from this southern African country. “We do not expect anyone to still\nbe using paper money in a year’s time,” the company’s CEO Douglas Mboweni recently\nsaid. “It will be just like Europe or America, where you no longer see people carrying bundles\nof cash.” The collapse of Zimbabwe’s economy in 2002 paved the way for Econet Wireless’s\nmobile payment system. “Hyperinflation had destroyed people’s confidence in financial\ninstitutions,” said the Zimbabwe company’s founder, Strive Masiyiwa, at the Mastercard\nFoundation Symposium on Financial Inclusion in July.\n“The lowest denomination circulating was $1,” Masiyiwa said. “If you want to buy a packet of\nsweets for your child, you can’t get change.” The company set up a mobile payment system\nthat handles small amounts and allows people to save as little as $1. “Today 43% of the\nGDP moves through Econet Wireless,” he concludes. Masiyiwa was born in Zimbabawe\n(then Rhodesia) in 1961. He and his parents fled the country in the turmoil after prime\nminister Ian Smith declared independence in 1965, settling in Zambia. His parents, who ran\ntheir own business, could afford to send Masiyiwa to school in Scotland when he was 12.\nAfter school he studied electronic engineering at the University of Wales and worked briefly\nfor a computer company in Cambridge before returning to Zimbabwe in the early 1980s.\nEconet Wireless was established in 1998, but not before a fight. Masiyiwa waged a five-year\nlegal battle with the government for a licence to deliver telephone services. The company\nnow operates in 17 countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and\nNew Zealand. In 2000, while the UN filed a civil suit against Mugabe, Masiyiwa moved his\nfamily and company headquarters to South Africa. Econet Wireless first developed mobile\npayments to help NGOs transfer money to refugees after the war in Burundi ended in 2005.\n“Donor agencies were trying to find ways to make cash disbursements to refugees,” says\nMasiyiwa. “So we built the payment system initially not as a business but as a way to help\nhumanitarians get money to people in rural areas who were trying to re-establish their lives.”\nThat model was extended and now mobile money transfers are central to Econet Wireless’s\nbusiness. Like M-Pesa before it, the company blurs the lines between telecomms and\nbanking. Masiyiwa is passionate about this latter part of his business. He believes that\nextending saving and credit services to the poorest people gives them “extraordinary dignity\nand a sense that they are in control of their own lives”. His next challenge is to create a\nproduct that allows people who are informally employed, such as smallholder farmers and\ncasual workers, to access credit. “In Africa 70% of people are informally employed,” he says.\n“The big frontier for us is to create platforms where those people can access credit.” He says\nthere’s no risk that they will get into unmanageable debt because the banks won’t extend\nexcessive credit, calling the system “self-regulating”.\nBut Masiyiwa says that offering people the ability to save is even more important than credit.\n“We’re trying to build up a savings culture where people are encouraged to save, even if\nthey only have a dollar – for children’s school fees, for transport, for the doctor. A savings\nand credit infrastructure builds resilience.” In his speech to microfinance experts at the\nsymposium in Turin, Masiyiwa recounted a story about the judge in Zimbabwe who granted\nEconet Wireless’s licence in 1998, saying that 70% of people in the country had never heard\na telephone ring. “Today, 75% of people [in Zimbabwe] have a cell phone,” he said “And I\nwant 75% of the people in Africa to have a bank account … on a mobile phone.”\nAnd Masiyiwa has even found a solution to the energy problem that could prevent him from\nrealising his dream. “We have developed solar charging stations where people can go into a\nkiosk and plug in their phone for free. Because our money is not made from someone\ncharging the phone. It’s made from someone using the phone.” By way of lessons learnt,\nMasiyiwa says that in order to reach the unbanked, financial institutions – and\ntelecommunications companies – must design services that are practical, simple and\naffordable. “I’ve got a customer who has a dollar in his pocket and has got to decide to have\nsome lunch, call his cousin or go to the doctor. We have to develop services with sensitivity\nto the fact that in Africa our customers don’t have the same disposable income as in New\nZealand, for example.”\nBut the billionaire businessman cautions that it’s a mistake assume the poorest behave\ndifferently to other customers. “Their behaviour and aspirations are no different from those\nwho have higher incomes,” he says. “They want to use Facebook. They want to use\nWhatsApp. We have to find ways for them to access those things with their very low\nincome.”\n"
