[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: Re: \nImportance: High \nthis was just tweeted by famous saudi opposition @mujtahidd.. almost 2 million followers.. \n#Trump MBS scandal involving President @realDonaldTrump and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman... \nFollowing @realDonaldTrump's visit to SA, US stance on Saudi affairs changed especially on competition \nbetween MBS & MBN and Qatar siege. \nMBS = Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (de facto King) \nMBN = Mohammad bin Nayef (deposed Saudi Crown Prince and Interior Minister) \nPrior to @realDonaldTrump, US institutions stood firmly with MBN throughout Obama's presidency. This was \nreaffirmed in a letter to the King. \nAfter @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit, he changed the US stance on the MBS v MBN power struggle and \nforced the establishment to back MBS. \nPast US administrations were keen on avoiding strife within GCC: This is because American interests cannot be \nupheld without a harmonic GCC. \nThat was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which Qatar siege began and he openly supported \nit contradicting Defence&State Dept \nThat was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which Qatar siege began and he openly supported \nit contradicting Defence&State Dept \nMore bizarrely; MBS has a secure direct line to Trump like no other leader has - not even Israeli Netanyahu & \nBritish May... \nThe following story explains MBS's 'special' influence over @realDonaldTrump - even if it means \ncompromising America's national interests... \nDuring @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit in May 2017 a private yacht discreetly arrived at Jeddah Port; heavily \nguarded and identity hidden. \nEven the Port's authorities were not allowed near it. Only a number of individuals reached it - delivering several \nboxes of cash ($1bn USD). \nAfter loading the boxes, the yacht disappeared. The operation lasted hours & was kept secret as was yacht's \nidentity, origin and destination \nIt transpired from MBS's inner circles that the $ lbn was from MBS himself & the yacht belonged indirectly to \n@Trump Organisation. #Trump MBS \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032643 \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Nov 6, 2017, at 10:57 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nwowo \nOn Mon, Nov 6, 2017 at 2:39 PM, < wrote: \nhttp s ://www. al-monitor. com/pulse/en/originals/2017/11/s audi-arab ia-crown-prince-remove-opp onents-\nnational-guard.html  \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Nov 5, 2017, at 1:08 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nthe missile or the anti corruption \nOn Sat, Nov 4, 2017 at 4:18 PM, wrote: \nkeep close eye on what is going on in saudi right now \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Nov 2, 2017, at 5:56 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nim really looking forward to it. . however today sick with flu \nOn Thu, Nov 2, 2017 at 10:48 AM, wrote: \ni m going to germany next week for two days to see terry. any plans to visit gcc soon? \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Oct 30, 2017, at 6:18 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \ngood proposal. everyone there still dealing with remnants of investor conference. . hope your are well \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
