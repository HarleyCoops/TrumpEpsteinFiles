I would \njust like to know if you intend to go ahead with the interior design work because Florence is \nblocked and waiting. If you want to do it and since about —70-80-90% of the project is \napproved then why don't we start with what is sure and for the remaining points, such as the \nkitchen, we can see about these the next time you are in Paris. \nAs for the kitchen I understand new samples were sent yesterday. These samples are in grey \nwhich is not a very bright color for a beach house kitchen where perhaps blue might be more \nappropriate. Let's see. \nIf you would like us to do the project we will send you a budget recap for the points agreed \nupon along with our first account and fees. \nBig kisses, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032376 \nLinda PINTO \nCabinet Alberto Pinto \n11 rue d'Aboukir \n75002 Paris \nT: \nF: \nwww.albertopinto.com \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
