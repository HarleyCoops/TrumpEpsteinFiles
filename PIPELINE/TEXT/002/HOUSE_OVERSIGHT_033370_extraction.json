FAA informs me its taken \nunder into consideration on a case by case basis if they will approve another buyer to operate my FAR125 certificate. My \nFAA inspector did mention that Trump did the same deal when he purchased his B757, it included the manuals and \ncompany. \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nTo: \nSent: Tue, Nov 12, 2013 3:37 pm \nSubject: Re: B727 deal \nok to all \nOn Tue, Nov 12, 2013 at 3:51 PM, wrote: \nJeffrey, \nI spoke to Gary and he agrees to make a counter offer, do you agree with the following: \n-Counter the offer at $2.750M \n-deal to include my FAR125 certificate, along with the company name: JEGE, Inc. this provides the buyer with ease of \ntransition and keeps the B727 on its current FAR125, tremendous value to buyer,. \n-Buyer understands purchase is \"As Is\" but has the opportunity to visually inspect the aircraft in Palm Bch along with my \nrecords. \n-closing to be on December 30th 2013. \n-Buyer will pay round trip repositioning expense Brunswick GA to Palm Beach and return to Brunswick if buyer declines \nthe aircraft (fuel cost round trip $14,930.00). \n-Seller will deduct the reposition expense if buyer proceeds with purchase.
