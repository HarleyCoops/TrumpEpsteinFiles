As of today, \nthere are eight (8) of these aircraft that are not yet on the market. \nLet me know if you would like to speak with him and by what means (you call him, he call you, call \nLarry ....whatever). \nBy the way, his company sold Trumps 727 and got Trump a very attractive number for an aircraft that was on \nit's way to a museum. \nHope all is well. \nSincerely, \nEric Roth \nPresident \nInternational Jet Interiors \n2221 Smithtown Avenue \nLong Island MacArthur Airport \nRonkonkoma, NY 11779 \nEm Phone \nFax \nCell \ne-mail \nwww.intljet.com website \nFrom: Jeffrey Epstein [mailto:jeevacation@gmail.com] \nSent: Saturday, June 25, 2011 12:29 AM \nTo: Eric Roth \nSubject: Re: \nnot yet \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033599 \nOn Fri, Jun 24, 2011 at 8:20 PM, Eric Roth \nAny photos?
