The strain of anti-intellectualism has \nbeen a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that \ndemocracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.\" \nOnly thing stupefying me about Trump so far is that all his EPA appointees come from the great wasteland called \nOklahoma—Inhofe et al, climate change deniers to the last, but climate change is inescapable and by going back to \nour old way of doing things, it will merely come all the quicker \nall best \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033227 \n"
