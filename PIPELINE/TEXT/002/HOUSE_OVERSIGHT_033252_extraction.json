We are in full pre-production of our \"Radical Breakthroughs\" series/season for Closer To \nTruth. We expect to have a complete production plan, with contributors, locations and schedule, by mid/late \nNovember - when (coincidentally) I will be back in NY. \nMy next email will add detail, including first (rough) outlines of the first two episodes. I'll be copying the \nproducer/director of Closer To Truth, as I will from now on with all reports/communications related to the \ncontent of the series. Whenever we want to communicate privately, about the series/grant or anything else, \nplease use a separate email (or respond to this one). \nI am in Santa Monica for two weeks, then Beijing for the big Party Congress. I may need to stay until after \nTrump's (supposed) visit. Attached are my two recent BBC commentaries on China (N.Korea bomb and \nMyanmar refugees). \nAlways available to Skype. \nI am truly excited about the series - nothing like it, could have impact - and I deeply appreciate your \ngenerosity/support, confidence and trust. \nTake care and warm regards, \nRobert \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033252 \n"
