Can U.S. big tech stocks soldier on \nalone or is this a harbinger that the group as a whole \nis losing its tremendous leadership position? \n• Sep 13, 2018 \n• Technology & Security \n• Tech Backlash \n• Save Article \n• Download PDF \n• \n• big-tech-backlash \nIn recent months, China's BAT collapse has demonstrated how costly the expectation of \ninvincibility can be—Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are all down more than 24% \nfrom their year-to-date closing highs. Citigroup's head of Asia strategy, Mohammed \nApabhai, told CNN an apt analogy about the investor sentiment that led to BAT's collapse, \nlikening \"the exuberance for tech stocks to the Looney Tunes cartoons in which Wile E. \nCoyote chases Road Runner over a cliff.\" Given they've more or less moved in \ntandem for years, will FAANG follow the same path as BAT? \nSource: Stockcharts.com \nThe BAT collapse was triggered by subpar earnings and a shifting regulatory environment \nin China. Facebook's miss in 2Q18—which drove a $120 billion single-day market cap \nloss, the biggest ever for a U.S. company—showed how decisive a turn could be if more \nU.S. tech darlings stumble this quarter. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032806 \nThere are mounting fundamental reasons to question the 3Q18 earnings \nprospects of FAANG, from the accelerating user backlash against Facebook to Apple's \ntrade war exposure to Amazon's rapidly-intensifying workforce revolt that could see the e-\ncommerce giant left with no option but to raise wages and improve workplace conditions \nfor its warehouse and Whole Foods employees. \nHowever, as Apabhai suggests, the message BAT is sending is less about earnings, and \nmore about the cost of exuberance. And FAANG exuberance faces threats that go beyond \nfundamentals. A flurry of regulatory announcements last week signaled the \npolitical tide has turned in the U.S. Across every branch of government, the \nmessage was consistent: the U.S. no longer trusts tech giants to self-\npolice. And the public agrees—according to a Gallup poll last month, 79% of \nAmericans now believe \"tech companies should be regulated the same way \nthe news media is.\" \nRegardless of political will, threats may not turn to action in the near term. Nonetheless, \nFAANG appears increasingly vulnerable to a decisive sentiment shift. At some point, the \nrelentless barrage of bad news will force investors to begin pricing in regulatory risks. Any \nsustained stumble by FAANG's leadership could cripple exuberance, and cause an \nunraveling of passive and algorithmic strategies that are heavily overweight tech \n(see W/LTWApril 7, 2018 for more). We will continue to watch closely to estimate \ntiming, but given SAT's collapse, today more than ever, acute scrutiny of tech \ngiant leadership is required. \nThrough August 28, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft had accounted for greater than 35% of \nthe S&P 500's total return this year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. It took \nAmazon just 165 trading days to grow its market value from $600 billion in January to $1 \ntrillion. The combined market cap of FAAMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and \nGoogle) now sits over $4 trillion, or roughly equal to the combined market cap of the 283 \nsmallest S&P 500 members. \nTech's continued market leadership means investors have largely discounted \nthe mounting risks tech giants face. We have been warning about the downsides of \ntech giant monopolism for more than two years in these pages, from surveillance/data \nsecurity concerns to anticompetitive behavior and their role in escalating inequality. For \nthe political establishment, for the media, for the public, this year has seen a \nbroad awakening—the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the backlash against Jeff Bezos' \nastonishing wealth, and tech's ever-skyrocketing market caps were all warning signs. The \npast month signals a new phase has begun: from a distant rumbling of change \nto preparation for action. \nThe number of significant tech-related regulatory developments that have emerged from \nthe U.S. and the E.U. in recent weeks is nothing short of staggering. Here is an \nabbreviated list: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032807 \n• President Trump attacked Google for liberal bias, and claimed Google, Facebook, \nand Amazon represent \"a very antitrust situation\". \n• Attorney General Jeff Sessions convened a meeting of Republican state \nattorneys general to discuss whether tech giants \"may be hurting competition and \nintentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.\" \n• Facebook, Twitter, and Google were called to testify in front of the House and Senate \nabout election interference, political bias, etc. Google declined to attend. \n• The FTC has begun a series of hearings on Digital Age antitrust, the first such \nhearings since the 1990s. \n• The FTC revealed the hiring of Lina Kahn—heralded for authoring a groundbreaking \nantitrust argument against Amazon—as an advisor. (See section 5 for more.) \n• Republican Senator Orrin Hatch asked the FTC to reopen a 2013 \nantitrust case against Google. \n• Democratic Senator Mark Warner released a six-point policy proposal on regulating \nthe tech industry. \n• Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the \"BEZOS Act\", which would tax \ncorporations one dollar for every dollar low-wage workers receive in government health-\ncare benefits or food stamps. \n• The E.U. Parliament voted 438 to 226 to back a draft proposal of \ncopyright reformsthat will impose unprecedented liability on information platforms. \n• France is pushing to have \"Right to be Forgotten\" laws applied globally, \nwhich Google is now fighting in court. \n• Reports emerged that the E.U. is considering investigating Google's location-\ntracking practices on data privacy grounds. \nWe will continue to watch each development in the U.S. and E.U. closely to understand if \nand when debate turns to action. For now, we agree with the analysis of NYU Stern \nprofessor Scott Galloway, who told CNBC last week after the congressional hearings: \nI don't see anything meaningful coming out of this panel, much less Washington...D.C. \nlacks the domain expertise or the will to go after big tech. Where you may \nsee it is, one, out of Brussels and, two, out of [the FTC, the DOJ, or] a red \nstate whose attorney general sees the brightest path between the AG's mansion and the \ngovernor's mansion is a populist argument against big tech. \nEvidence of fundamental weakness could exacerbate the investor reaction to escalating \nregulatory news. By all accounts, Facebook has continued to bleed \nusers. According to Pew Research poll results released earlier this month, more than a \nquarter of U.S. Facebook users claim to have deleted the app from their phones over the \npast year: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032808 \nSource: Recode \nThen there's Apple. The trade war combined with China's slowing economy present a \nsignificant short-term threat to the company's profits. As we note in section \n1, smartphone handset sales in China in August were reported at 32.6 million \nunits, a decline of 20.9% year-over-year and 11.8% month-on-\nmonth. Moreover, no firm could suffer more if China decides to target tech \nsupply chains in retaliation to Trump's tariffs. \nYet, the risks extend beyond Asia. On Wednesday, Apple announced its newest generation \nof iPhones. It is following the same strategy as last year, releasing ever-more expensive \nphones as it tries to keep profit growth on pace despite a largely-matured smartphone \nmarket. As The Wall Street Journal reported this week, projections suggest last year's \n$1,000 iPhone X underperformed previous launches: \"Even for Apple and its devoted \nfans, the art of the upsell appears to have some limits...Analysts believe the \niPhone X has accounted for about 30% of iPhone unit sales in the recent nine-month \nperiod...That is below the share the company's newest models typically get in a given \ncycle.\" Will a $1,200 iPhone cross the limits of what the market will tolerate? \nWe have roughly a month until 3Q18 earnings season begins. For years, big tech's \nremarkable profit trajectory has generated an air of invincibility. BAT's earnings miss \ncombined with Facebook's earnings miss has cracked that expectation. As news reports \nof regulatory threats continue to flood in and as tech giant profit doubts \nmount, the weeks to come could see that crack turn to a fissure. \nThen there's Apple. The trade war combined with China's slowing economy \npresent a significant short-term threat to the company's profits.
