We are trying to determine whether there is any \ntruth to the allegations that either or both of these men may have had sexual relations with minors \nwhile there. We know that you have been Epstein's pilot, so we're wondering if you would be willing \nto speak with us completely off the record. We are not focusing on the allegations against Epstein --\nwe are solely focusing on Trump and Clinton given the current allegations being levied in the press. \nIf you don't feel comfortable sharing anything via social media or email, feel free to send us any \ndocumentation/proof that might be helpful anonymously via mail: \nMelanie Hicken \nYou can also reach us by phone: \nThanks so much, \nMelanie \nReply \nNot \ninterested \nView Melanie's LinkedIn profile \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032058 \nYou are receiving InMail notification ern& Unsubscribe \nThis email was intended fo (Corporate Pilot in SoCal - Gulfstream GIV Current).
