[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: Questions for article \nImportance: High \nJeffrey, \nHuffington Post is almost done with their article. They need couple answers to use them for your quotes. Please \nsee below. \nQuestions for you: \n1. As a result of Trump's budget cuts, more scientists are turning to private donors for funds. How have you \nhelped these scientists thrive during this time in particular? \n2. Why do you think it's important to have funded the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and how will this \nprogram help us in the future? \nQuestions for a scientist (can I ask Martin to answer and quote him)? \n1. How has Jeffery Epstein's donations helped you advance your research? \nLet me know if you have any questions or comments. Would appreciate speedy response. \nThank you! \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032563 \n"
