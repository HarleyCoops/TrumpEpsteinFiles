The most distant \ngalaxies billions of light years away, have no reality without you, \nbecause everything that makes any galaxy real— with the multitude \nof stars with their heat, emitted light, and masses, the positions of \nthe distant galaxies in space and the velocity that carries each \ndistant galaxy away at enormous speed—requires a human \nobserver with a human nervous system.

Physical phenomena, and \nphenomena in general, are \nultimately perceptual in nature and subject to \nobservational replication - that's why they call \nphysics an empirical science. But consciousness is \nnot. \nConsciousness cannot be objectively, replicably \nobserved. Its putative physical correlates, including \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032408 \nbrains and behaviors, can be replicably observed, and \nit can be subjectively \napprehended by any conscious entity. But that's it. \nAnyone who denies this understands neither physics \nnor consciousness, and has a severe logic problem to \nboot, inasmuch as he/she cannot properly distinguish \nbetween cognition and perception or internal and \nexternal state. \nThis isn't \"polemics\". This is just the way it is.
