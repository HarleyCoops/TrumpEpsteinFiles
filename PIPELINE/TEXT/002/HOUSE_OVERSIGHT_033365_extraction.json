Almost exactly 100 years earlier, China’s “May Fourth Movement”\nof 1919 was a direct response to the actions of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War\nI. Wilson had promised China, an American ally, that German colonies in Shandong would be\nreturned to Chinese sovereignty, but instead handed them to Japan. China exploded with anti-\nAmerican, nationalist sentiment. One of the eventual consequences was the establishment of the\nChinese Communist Party, which for the last 70 years has ruled the country.\nThus, Mr. Trump has handed Xi Jinping a remarkably effective nationalist card to play at a time\nwhen he has been under pressure at home because of a slowing economy. The Chinese media is\nnow full of accounts of the country’s economic resilience and appeals to patriotism, even invoking\nthe spirit of the Korean War, when, according to the official narrative, China was able to stare\ndown the vastly superior American military.\nAnd just in case people didn’t get the point, Mr. Xi recently visited Jiangxi, the starting point of\nthe Long March in 1934, in which the Communist Party endured many hardships but ultimately\nemerged victorious.\nI can almost hear members of the Trump administration groaning. Why on earth would they need\nto take into consideration events in China’s ancient past?\nThe answer depends on what Mr. Trump’s primary objective is. If it’s to sound tough to American\nvoters, he may well have a winning formula. But if it’s to bring about a substantive change in\nChina’s negotiating posture toward a bilateral trade agreement, one that might usher in changes\nin China’s trade policy, addressing questions of forced technology transfers, intellectual property\ntheft, industrial subsidies, currency manipulation and a phalanx of other non-tariff barriers, I’m\nnot so sure.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/trump-china-trade-war.html 1/3\n5/29/2019 Opinion | Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War - The New York Times\nDays after the president’s tweets, China listed three “red lines,” positions the United States had\ntaken in the trade talks that were unacceptable: First, that it would keep tariffs in place for a\nperiod after the proposed trade agreement was signed. Second, that it could impose punitive\ntariffs if it judged China to be in violation of the agreement, and that China would be forbidden\nfrom retaliating with its own tariffs. Third, the ever-inflating expectations of the terms under\nwhich Beijing would buy American goods under a proposed bilateral purchasing agreement.\nThese “red lines” were new. Before that, China’s negotiating team had a fully flexible remit from\nthe leadership. But not anymore. Now that these three lines are in the public domain, there is no\nway Chinese leaders can yield on them. The leaks of large parts of the negotiating text to the\nAmerican news media has added a new level of toxicity, making it virtually impossible to return\nto the existing text as a basis of negotiations. Together with recent moves against the Chinese\ntelecom company Huawei presumably intended to pressure Beijing further, the possibility of\nnegotiating a revised agreement that is more accommodating to American interests is now very\nslim.\nInstead, what I have seen in Beijing over the last few weeks is a country moving in exactly the\nopposite direction.\nRelated\nMore on the trade war.\nOpinion | Michelle Cottle\nDonald Trumpʼs Great Patriotic Wars May 26, 2019\nEconomic analysts, meanwhile, have been calculating the impact of a full-blown trade war,\nestimating a loss of about 1.2 percentage points to Chinese G.D.P. growth. This figure is now\nportrayed in the Chinese media as entirely manageable given China’s capacity to use fiscal and\nmonetary policy stimulus to support domestic demand and keep growth above 6 percent.\nEven if a trade deal with the United States is still possible, some in the Chinese leadership are\nnow starting to ask, why bother? They argue that in technology, investment, foreign policy,\nnational security and human rights, the Trump administration has made it clear that it has\nembarked on a more adversarial position toward China. So why should Beijing expend any more\npolitical capital on a trade deal? Perhaps it’s better, in China’s view, to cut its losses now and get\nready for the next Cold War.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/trump-china-trade-war.html 2/3\n5/29/2019 Opinion | Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War - The New York Times\nIf that’s what the Trump administration wants, its strategy has been a great success. If not, and\nthe president really wants a trade deal, with reasonable decreases in the bilateral trade deficit,\nand some substantive changes in Chinese economic behavior, the American negotiating strategy\nrequires some serious recalibration.\nOf course, China’s public position is that negotiations can continue. Even within the framework of\nthe new “red lines,” there may still be room for a deal. China might agree to purchase more\nAmerican goods, with America yielding on the retention of tariffs, and the unilateral right to\nimpose tariffs later. However, the degree of difficulty in getting to an agreement has now\nincreased substantially.\nThe bottom line is that nationalism is not just a factor in Trump’s America. It’s now a big factor in\nXi Jinping’s China as well, reinforced through the prism of Chinese history. In most of its dealings\nwith America over the last 100 years, China has seen itself as weak. Today, in Beijing’s view,\nChina is weak no longer.\nKevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia, is president of the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
