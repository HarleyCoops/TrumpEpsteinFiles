She could acknowledge that she \nunderstands that people want change, and ask for a clear majority in the senate thinking abou that instead of \npresidential elections. Then if she does bad in 4 years she is out, but she could make the public understand that \nsenate is key to show what a president can do. \nBut again, I know 0.001% of what you or them understands about politics, I am however worried that europe is \njust 5 or 10 years ahead on this trend compared to the US in anti-establishment feelings and I have seen with \nfriends how irrational and influenceable masses can become in voting when they are frustrated (Hitler was \nelected after all...) \nHope to see you soon!!! \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032308 \n"
