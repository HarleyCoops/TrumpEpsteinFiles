Globalisation had lifted billions from\npoverty and the logic of free trade and capital flows\nwas accepted from Beijing to Zanzibar. But in 2007,\nwhen the North Atlantic financial crisis revealed the\nflaws of excessive financialisation, doubts about\nglobalisation began to creep in.\nGlobalisation, in the form of the spread of trade,\nmoney, people and information, is inevitable,\nessentially because of expanding demographics and\ntechnology. Human beings migrate all over the\nworld, and it was technology – the invention of\nrailways, ships, planes and now information\ncommunications – that accelerated the spread of\nglobal ideas and genes.\nAs Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, author of\nGlobalisation and Its Discontents, aptly put it,\nglobalisation is either positive or negative,\ndepending on how it is managed.\nLike any national system, the system works well\nwith someone providing public goods.\nThe internet is such a public good. It gave even\nthe most remote people and places access to global\nknowledge, thus making the world more inclusive.\nBut if and when the masses cannot benefit from\nsuch access, technology and globalisation can\nwiden inequalities, giving rise to anger, frustration\nand the rise of populist sentiments.\nThe reality is that globalisation cannot be\nstopped. But it can be managed better. The issues\nthat arouse anti-globalists can and should be\nmanaged. These are the interrelated issues of\nclimate change, disruptive technology, human\nmigration and toxic politics.\nBeing a businessman, Donald Trump’s basic\ninstinct is to manage these issues bilaterally, which\nis why intuitively he does not like multilateral groups\nlike the World Trade Organisation. But these\nmultilateral institutions provide exactly the global\npublic goods that make globalisation positive rather\nthan damaging. What is fair to a behemoth that\naccounts for 22 per cent of world gross domestic\nproduct may not be fair to a small bilateral trading\npartner one-tenth its size. The world’s multilateral\nrules, which took years to negotiate, are there\nbecause they bind everyone, large or small, to global\nmutual benefit and shared stability.\nWhat does President Xi Jinping’s ( 習近平 )\ncommitment to globalisation in Davos in January\nreally mean? There are several guiding principles\nbehind that gesture.\nFirst, there is Chinese recognition that global\nproblems like climate change, disruptive\ntechnology and human migration involve costs that\ncan only be solved from new resources generated\nthrough growth in trade and investments.\nSecond, China doesn’t see globalisation as a\nzero-sum game, but one where there can be benefits\nfor all, provided the downsides are managed on a\nmutually shared basis, according to mutually agreed\nmultilateral rules.\nThird, accounting for only 15 per cent of world\nGDP, China on its own cannot push globalisation. It\nmust work with the current advanced economies\nlike Europe (25 per cent of world GDP), Japan (6 per\ncent) and others.\nFourth, to be realistic, China’s contribution to\nglobalisation must work on the principle of\ncomparative advantage. Being a latecomer to\nglobalisation, China has considerable first-hand\nexperience in building infrastructure, supply chains\nand urban conglomeration under third-world\nconditions. Its comparative advantage is based on\nthe adaptation of modern technology, such as\ninternet platforms, to lower trading and transaction\ncosts. India, Kenya and other emerging markets are\nalso moving in the same direction.\nIn short, to promote the good side of\nglobalisation, we must apply 21st-century tools and\nexperience to manage 21st-century problems.\nGoing forward, the complexity is that Trump is\npushing the leading economy to swing from a major\ncontributor of global public goods to a “taxer” on\nglobalisation. That is the true meaning of the border\ntax and the chiding of allies that they need to\ncontribute to any bilateral efforts in defence or in the\nbuilding of walls. But America works on the basis of\nfreely importing resources and talent way in excess\nof domestic production. That manifests itself in its\nlarger and larger current account and fiscal deficits\nand its growing global debt.\nWhich is why everyone prays that saner heads\nwill prevail in America’s commitment to\nglobalisation. “America first” cannot operate on the\nbasis of everyone else loses. Just as business is too\nimportant to be left to businessmen, globalisation is\ntoo important to be left to its discontents.\nUNSHAKEABLE CORE\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn says China’s ‘two sessions’ underlines the non-negotiable nature of Xi’s status as core leader\nOne must comprehend\nthe country as a whole ...\nTo focus only on the\neconomy is to distort\nthe lens with which\nto view China\nThe “two sessions” in Beijing – the annual\nmeetings of the National People’s\nCongress and the Chinese People’s\nPolitical Consultative Conference – offer\nsome sense and insight about China’s\ngovernance. Attending them this year, I have come\naway with several impressions.\nOne is the conjunction of two ways of thinking\nthat Westerners would deem incompatible: stricter\nconformity and enforcement of political orthodoxy,\nand greater freedom and encouragement to critique\ngovernment programmes. To understand China’s\nsystem of governance, especially under President Xi\nJinping ( 習近平 ), now the “core” of the Chinese Communist\nParty, is to appreciate why these two ways of\nthinking are deemed complementary, not contradictory.\nChina’s leadership recognises that it needs\nthe wisdom of society, especially the expertise of the\nintellectual elite, to critique and improve government,\nbut the concern is that such criticism could be\ndestabilising. Hence the political controls to enable\nthe criticism.\nChina watchers scrutinise everything going on\nhere – work reports, press conferences, policy\nannouncements, personnel moves, sideline comments,\neven seating arrangements. Which policies\nare stressed? What signals are sent? Any surprises?\nWhat’s “in the air”?\nListening to Premier Li Keqiang ( 李克強 ) give the\nannual government work report to the nearly 3,000\nNPC delegates assembled in the Great Hall of the\nPeople, one is struck by the civilisation-state\npageantry of China state power and the sheer magnitude\nof managing this huge country. One must\ncomprehend the country as a whole, integrating\npolitical, social, cultural and ecological sectors with\nthe economy. To focus only on the economy is to\ndistort the lens with which to view China.\nTo the untrained eye, the structure and phrases of\nwork reports look similar to those of previous years.\nBut look closely and one sees the small but revelatory\ndifferences.\nChina’s ruling party prides itself on careful, incremental\nchange, and usually this is the case. But occasionally\nwe catch sharper breaks with past practice.\nThis year, three aspects stand out: reform, innovation\nand, most significantly, Xi’s leadership.\nFirst, while reform has long been a key feature of\ngovernment work reports, the pervasiveness of\nreform this year makes it special. Almost every section\nis founded on reform. Regarding the economy,\n“supply-side structural reform” is the well-known\nwatchword, and the report calls for cutting industrial\novercapacity, reducing urban real estate inventory,\ndeleveraging Chinese firms by decreasing debt, and\ncutting costs for doing business. All this I expected.\nWhat I did not expect was the specificity of directives\nfor cutting costs – with five detailed prescriptions,\nsuch as reducing a blizzard of governmentimposed\nfees, about which entrepreneurs have been\ncomplaining loudly. Reform affects almost every\naspect of society, including the household registration\nsystem (hukou), health care, environmental\nprotection, intellectual property rights and streamlining\ngovernment bureaucracy.\nInnovation is stressed for industrial transformation\n– not simply platitudes promoting science and\ntechnology but practical steps, such as enabling\nuniversities and research institutes to “operate with\nautonomy” and to implement “incentive policies\nlike stocks, options and dividends”.\nIt could hardly be clearer that China’s “socialism\nwith Chinese characteristics” continues to separate\nitself from the failed forms of 19th-century socialism\nthat founded the old Soviet Union and was passed to\nChina prior to the reforms of Deng Xiaoping ( 鄧小平 ).\nThe pervasiveness of reform and the call for innovation\nare the product of Xi’s leadership, which is what\nreally marked the two sessions. In his work report,\nPremier Li pledged to implement “General Secretary\nXi Jinping’s major addresses and his new vision,\nthinking and strategies for China’s governance”, and\nthe “four-pronged comprehensive strategy”, the\npolitical theory that Xi unveiled in 2015.\nOne need not be a China hand to see that Xi’s\n“four comprehensives” – to build a moderately\nprosperous society, deepen reform, advance the lawbased\ngovernance of China, and strengthen party\nself-governance – has been elevated to a foundational\ntheory of the state. In the theory section of the work\nreport, Xi’s contributions take up 39 words in the\nEnglish translation, more than double the theories of\nformer leaders Deng, Jiang Zemin ( 江澤民 ) and Hu\nJintao ( 胡錦濤 ), which collectively take up 18 words.\nSeparately, while “Marxism-Leninism” and\n“Mao Zedong thought” were duly noted in the draft\ngeneral provisions of civil law, the famous phrases\ndidn’t make the more important government work\nreport. I doubt the cut was made to save space.\nThe significance of Xi’s role as China’s preeminent\nleader is that it provides political stability\nand coherent policies, such that the crucial 19th\nparty congress, forthcoming in the autumn, should\nplay out according to expectations. My take from\nspeaking with delegates is that Xi’s leadership position\nas core of the party is confirmed and enhanced.\nThis means that China can focus on the hard tasks of\nenhancing reform and transforming the economy.\nOne other development is notable: the NPC is\nbecoming more an empowered deliberative body\nand less a “rubber stamp” cheerleader. An example\nof this is the multifaceted process of constructing a\ncomprehensive civil code, targeted for 2020. After\nthree revisions, the general provisions of civil law\nfinally provides a framework for codifying some 200\ncivil and commercial laws in constructing a legal\nsystem to serve civil society. The NPC’s growing\nconfidence to disclose disputes and to allow, indeed\nto encourage, debates is promising.\nAnd what of Xi’s anti-corruption drive? Foreign\nmedia typically assume that the drive reflects a\npower struggle among leaders and factions, while\nsome Chinese officials claim that it has nothing to do\nwith political struggle.\nThere are multiple reasons for the campaign, of\ncourse. More incisively, we can see how the campaign\nhas been energised by Xi’s “four comprehensives”\npolitical theory. One, realising a moderately\nprosperous society is hindered by corruption; two,\nreform is resisted by corrupt officials who protect\ntheir illicit financial benefits; three, the drive exemplifies\nthe rule of law; four, strictly governing the party\ncould be defined as anti-corruption.\nA few of the now-caged “tigers” were convicted of\n“seriously violating the party’s political discipline”\n“banding together in gangs and forming factions”,\nand conducting “non-organisational political activities”\n– a not very veiled code-phrase for attempting to\nundermine China’s leadership. By eliminating these\npolitical threats, the anti-corruption campaign helps\nensure political stability, especially as the country\nenters the final run-up to the 19th party congress.\nThere is now no ambiguity: China is under the\nfirm leadership of the party’s Central Committee,\nwith Xi as its core, and alignment with Xi’s “four confidences”doctrine\n– in which officials are urged to be\n“confident in China’s chosen path, political system,\nguiding theories, and culture” – is non-negotiable.\nMany areas of society and government are open\nto debate, but not the core principles and not the core\nleader. These have been decided and conformity is\nexpected. Only with such unity can the “four comprehensives”\nbring about the great rejuvenation of\nthe Chinese nation and realise the Chinese dream.\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn is a public intellectual, political/\neconomics commentator, and an international\ncorporate strategist.

Kuhn on CGTN (produced by Adam Zhu)\nJohn Tsang and a question of political ethics\nAndrew Sheng writes on global issues\nfrom an Asian perspective\nA section of a border fence separating the US and\nMexico is under construction. Photo: Bloomberg\nJohn Chan says Tsang’s assertion that his chief executive bid was\nan afterthought is unconvincing, given events of the past two years\nJohn Tsang Chun-wah has said he resigned as\nfinancial secretary not to run for chief\nexecutive, “but because of many other things”.\n“Unhappiness at work was one of the reasons.\nIt was not a sudden decision.” He also said he\nonly made up his mind to run after he had left.\nMost would find that hard to believe.\nJudging from Tsang’s high-profile preparation\nover the past two years, and the fact that he\nnever denied suggestions that he intended to\nrun, it is inconceivable that he should say he\nresigned in December not to run for the top\npost but for some other reason.\nConsideration of political morality explains\nwhy Tsang may have presented his case as an\nunbelievable sudden decision. He knows it\nwould be deemed politically unethical and\nimmoral if he should admit to preparing to run\nfor two years, or even from just before Chief\nExecutive Leung Chun-ying unexpectedly\nannounced he would not seek a second term.\nFormer chief secretary Carrie Lam Cheng\nYuet-ngor, in stark contrast to Tsang’s wishywashy\nstance, had always clearly asserted that\nshe would not run. Her firm denials changed\nonly after Leung said he would not seek a\nsecond term. Lam was clear on the point that it\nwould be politically immoral for a serving\ncabinet member to contest the top post with\nthe incumbent also running.\nIn the US, the last time a former cabinet\nsecretary became a major party’s choice for\npresident was in 1928, when commerce\nsecretary Herbert Hoover won the Republican\nnomination and went on to become the 31st\nUS president. However, he ran only after\nsitting president Calvin Coolidge said he\nwould not. It is political ethics that stops a US\ncabinet secretary running against a president\nseeking re-election. This is unlike in the\nparliamentary system in the UK or\nCommonwealth nations, where ministers are\nelected members of the ruling party or\ncoalition. Ministers and other ruling party MPs\nchoose their party leader, who becomes the\nprime minister. They also have the power to\ndepose and replace the incumbent.\nHong Kong’s cabinet of bureau secretaries\nnominated by the chief executive is similar to\nthe US system. If a financial secretary wishes to\nrun against his chief executive who is bidding\nfor a second term, he must resign as soon as he\nmanifests such an intention – failing to do so\nwould be politically immoral.\nTsang was quoted as saying, when\nquestioned on his obvious rift with Leung\nduring the Wang Chau development saga,\nthat: “You always agree with your boss. No\nquestion about that.” An explanatory\nextension could be: “If you do not agree with\nyour boss, you’ve got to leave. No question\nabout that.” More so if he harboured an\nintention to run against Leung.\nAlmost all local media and commentators\nsaid Tsang had been making preparations to\nrun for the top post for more than two years:\nTsang himself has never denied this. It was\nthus a big surprise that he should choose to say\nthe idea only emerged after his resignation was\napproved by Beijing. It comes across as a futile\nattempt to brush aside the lingering doubts\nover his political morality, given his\npreparations for the past two years.\nJohn Chan is a practising solicitor and a\nfounding member of the Democratic Party\nPrinted and published by South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd, Morning Post Centre, 22 Dai Fat Street, Tai Po Industrial Estate, Tai Po, Hong Kong.
