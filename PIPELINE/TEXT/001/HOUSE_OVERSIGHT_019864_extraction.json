    "full_text": "﻿SERIOUS MOONLIGHT\nBehind the scenes at the 2017 Academy Awards with filmdom’s first lady of Oscar cheerleading\n(my close friends know I was captain of the twirlers in high school)\nBy Peggy Siegal\nWas this year different from all other years at the Oscars?\nIn one way, it wasn't. A24's \"Moonlight\" won best picture because voters went for content over\nstyle. The win was for it’s poetic take on the American ideals that the Academy values most and\nwants reflected globally. History was also made as \"Moonlight\" became the first Oscar winner\nwith an all black cast and addressed the LGBTQ community. And, it was a beautiful film.\nBut on the other hand, Oscar voters were also dealing with a political and emotional crisis in the\nfilm industry. After two years of #OscarsSoWhite, they responded by nominating a record six\nAfrican American actors, four African American producers and one African American director,\nBarry Jenkins, the fourth ever nominated in that category. Three films addressing race were\nnominated for best picture: “Fences,” “Hidden Figures” and “Moonlight.”\nLionsgate's \"La La Land\" was a joyous escape from months of simmering frustration and anger\nat Donald J. Trump, himself a creature of the entertainment industry. The charming and modern\nmusical “La La” danced its way to multiple awards from critics, at the PGA, the DGA, the BAFTA\nand the Venice Film Festival, a record seven Golden Globes, en route to an historic fourteen\nAcademy Award nominations. Prognosticators predicted a \"La La” landslide.\nSo what happened? Days before the voting deadline, \"La La Land\" was tripped-up by a lastminute\nbacklash against frivolity. Even in La La Land, these are serious times.\nBackstage at the Dolby Theater, star-struck nitwit accountant Brian Cullinan, oblivious to the\nfact that the Oscars are a sacred secular ceremony and distracted while tweeting a photo of\nEmma Stone, handed Warren Beatty the wrong envelope. Chaos—and headlines—ensued.\nTweets, chaos and headlines? It was all too Trump for words.\nWhen I arrived at the Dolby Theater that night, I asked a dateless Andrew Garfield to take me\nonto the red carpet with him, to the chagrin of his publicist. But a security guard rejected me\nbecause my ticket was the wrong color. Andrew winked, laughed and disappeared. Undaunted,\nI went back to the curb to find another walker. As I stood at the limo drop-off, inconspicuous in a\nday-glow orange satin dress, Kelly Bush, a publicist I knew from last year's \"The Revenant\"\ncampaign, sidled over and said, \"There is going to be an upset. ‘Moonlight’ is winning.\"\nOn cue, “La La Land” producer Marc Platt arrived with the studs on his formal shirt popping off.\nAs I nervously fiddled in his buttonholes, I blurted, \"Kelly Bush just said ‘Moonlight’ is winning.”\nMarc turned white.\nThe red carpet was a three lane highway. The speed lane was for the super stars, the middle for\nfrantic handlers, and on the right was the schlepper lane for relatives and relative nobodies.\nFour security guards escorted me there. By the time Marc and I met again at the end of the\nthree prong red carpet, \"La La Land\" publicist and West Coast campaign queen Lisa Taback\nwas furious I’d told the shaken producer his film might lose. I said, \"Kelly Bush said that, not\nme.\" But I felt terrible.\nSure enough, the “La La” landslide never happened. It did win a spectacular six Oscars before\nWarren Beatty and Faye Dunaway walked to center stage for the best picture finale.\nI was now standing against the wall at the first row of the first balcony. Lionsgate publicists Julie\nFontaine and Jennifer Peterson, both dressed in haute couture gowns and borrowed emeralds,\nanxiously insisted I join their good luck group hug as best picture was announced. Despite my\nfaux pas, and my work on most of the year’s top films, including “Moonlight,” “Manchester by the\nSea” and “Hidden Figures,” Oscar night I was in the “La La” camp due to my long friendship with\nit’s director Damien Chazelle.\nSo we three bejeweled broads were hugging tightly, when Faye broke Warren’s pregnant pause\nand screamed \"La La Land\". The girls cried, the “La La” producers ran to the stage and I was\nthinking about how to apologize to Marc Platt as he thanked his family. Then, the stage filled up\nwith men in headsets. Producer Jordan Horowitz, the class act of the evening, grabbed the right\ncard and calmly announced \"Moonlight. No Joke.\" Platt, Horowitz and their co-producer Fred\nBerger handed their Oscars to Moonlight director Barry Jenkins, and producers Jeremy Kleiner\nand Adele Romanski and left the stage as Mahershala Ali, the first Muslim actor to get the gold\nguy, joined the cast waving his historic Oscar.\nJulie and Jennifer ran to Soho House to oversee Lionsgate's victory party, where hundreds of\nconfused well-wishers waited to celebrate the “La La” wins, including Emma Stone’s best\nactress, Justin Hurwitz’s best score, and Benj Pasek, Justin Paul and Justin Hurwitz’s best song\nfor “City of Stars.” At 32, Damien Chazelle also made history as the youngest best director ever.\nSome, lacking any empathy for the winners and losers onstage, called this historic screw-up\n\"great live-television.” But standing in the balcony, alone and speechless, all I could think was,\n“How did I miss this?”\nI ran to the Governor's Ball, which is the next stop for winners on their busy night. They get their\nstatues engraved there before they drop by their studio’s party, get photographed, Oscar in\nhand at Vanity Fair’s fete, wall-to-wall with celebrities, and then head to Guy Oseary's home\nhigh in Beverly Hills to rock-and-roll ‘till dawn.\nAt the entrance to the Governor's Ball, Warren Beatty walked up to me, still holding the two\npriceless envelopes as proof of his innocence. I asked him, \"What happened?\"\nHis phone rang. It was so noisy, he bent toward me to hear better. The phone was almost in my\nface and I heard Annette Benning asking where he was and saying, \"Warren, come home.\"\nWarren said, \"No. I have done nothing wrong.\"\nWarren's wonderful film, \"Rules Don't Apply\" received little Academy love, yet he was generous\nenough to show up. Now, fifty years after “Bonnie and Clyde,” he was in the Oscar spotlight\nagain, the latest unwitting star of Oscar’s all-time blooper reel. As Jimmy Kimmel said, “We don’t\nhave to watch reality shows anymore because we are living in one.”\nHere’s reality-show Oscar week as I lived it:\nTuesday, February 21st\nI checked into Jeff Klein's Sunset Tower Hotel still exhausted from last weekend's oh-so-grand\nbirthday extravaganza thrown by fun loving billionaire Stephen Schwarzman’s wife Christine for\nhis 70 th Birthday in Palm Beach—and headed straight to Charles Finch's photo exhibition, \"The\nArt of Behind the Scenes,\" to see rare candid on-set photos of Audrey Hepburn, Brigitte Bardot,\nGrace Kelly and Ava Gardner.\nOscar balloting had closed an hour earlier, and IndieWire's Oscar blogger Anne Thompson\nannounced that a female friend had voted for all the diverse and minority nominees. This first\nhint of things to come didn’t register as a bell ringer for best picture. Spotted: Jean Pigozzi, Brett\nRatner and Paul Haggis.\nBack at The Sunset Tower Bar, diminutive maitre d' Dmitri Dimitrov slid up to me, cupped his\nhands in prayer and whispered, \"Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper are in the corner booth with\nWarner Bros. Sue Kroll.\" They were talking about their remake of \"A Star is Born\" going into\nproduction within the month.\nAt the next table was Ryan Murphy, creator of the multi-award winning FX mini-series \"The\nPeople vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story,” eating with his muse Sarah Paulson, who\nwon countless awards for portraying Marcia Clark. I joked that the Oscar nominated\ndocumentary \"O.J.: Made in America\" from ESPN would win because voters thought both films\nare the same.\nWednesday, February 22nd\nI met Adam Lindemann and museum director Michael Govan at LACMA’s The Inner Eye: Vision\nand Transcendence in African Art. Michael and I discussed the struggle to diversify the\nAcademy. He told me that at LACMA he’d hired women, African American and Latino curators\nyears before.\nVanity Fair Editor-in-Chief Graydon Carter and Barneys hosted a private dinner for \"La La Land\"\nat the Chateau Marmont. Graydon always tries to entertain the winning film. Drinks around the\npool were followed by a seated dinner for fifty in a bungalow. Emma Stone brought her mother.\nHandsome hotelier Andre Balazs darts around. Ryan Gosling stayed home with his girlfriend\nEva Mendes and their two baby girls. Emma talked about her next film \"Battle of the Sexes.\"\nShe plays Billie Jean King opposite Steve Carell, an excellent tennis player in real life, as Bobby\nRiggs.\nDamien Chazelle came late from a dinner for the nominated directors. The Academy hosts a\nseries of secret dinners during Oscar week for key nominees to keep them away from sponsors\nwho profit from their celebrity. They also want to protect their own sponsor, ABC-TV, with\nexclusivity and audience surprise.\nThursday, February 23rd\nLarry Gagosian's annual Oscar-week art opening is always a hot ticket. Serious collectors\nblended in unnoticed among the mere lookers and pretty gallerists quietly pointing out one\nglorious Joe Bradley painting after another. Each costs a cool million and between 6:00pm and\n8:00pm they are all sold. Buyers and Larry's close friends then migrate down the block to Mr.\nChow. Elton John and David Furnish, Jonah Hill, Dakota Johnson, Sharon Stone,\nNBCUniversal's Ron Meyer, Gus Van Sant, Emily Ratajkowski, Dasha Zhukova, artists Alex\nIsrael, Harmony Korine and Dan Colen, rocker Robbie Robertson and Page Six’s Ian Mohr dig\ninto orange chicken on sticks. Larry's girls come around and slip his home address onto laps.\nThis means you have made the cut to attend Larry's after party at his house.\nIan and I head to Paul Haggis' intimate Artist for Peace and Justice benefit dinner for 65 at the\nLA club No Name where a great time set guests back $2,500 for Haiti. We arrive just in time to\nhear Jeff Bridges sing a song from \"Crazy Heart\", Jack Black recall \"School of Rock \" and Rita\nWilson sing ABBA's \"Dancing Queen\". Jackson Browne is the master of ceremonies.\nI end up at A24's party at the Sunset Tower for their films \"20th Century Woman\" and\n\"Moonlight\". Barry Jenkins wants to know if he is winning the Oscar. I chirp, \"Yes, best adapted\nscreenplay is all yours!\" Not the answer he was looking for. I should have said, \"Yes, you will\nwin best picture, make history and bring the house down.\" I would have looked like a genius.\nFinally, I speak to Janelle Monae, who is absolutely stunning. She also wants to know if \"Hidden\nFigures\" is winning the Oscar. I assure her that her real win was at the box office.\nBefore passing out in my Sunset Tower suite, I email Damien Chazelle a social wrap-up on the\nevening, as he is now sick as a dog, in bed with his dog and has had visiting nurses injecting\nfluids into his flu-infested body all day.\nHe, too, asks if he is winning the Oscar. I write, \"It's not if, but how many\".\nFriday, February 24\nI’m a gal hell bent on making a fashion statement with every outing, who runs her business from\nthe back seat of a chauffeured black Cadillac with the license plate PEG-FILM. So marching or\nattending a protest rally is not the likely place to find me. But when I read the United Talent\nAgency's United Voice Rally was happening at their Beverly Hills headquarters--2,000 of the\ncreative community’s best looking turning out on a gorgeous afternoon to stand together for\nfreedom of speech, and against exclusion and division, it was an invitation I couldn’t refuse. This\nis a substitute for UTA’s traditional pre-Oscar party--and the ten percenters donated and raised\n$320,000 for the American Civil Liberties Union and the International Rescue Committee. CEO\nJeremy Zimmer and clients Jodie Foster and Michael J. Fox speak passionately.\nThe surprise highlight is taped remarks from Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, nominated for\n\"The Salesman\". Farhadi made international headlines announcing he would not travel to\nHollywood in protest of President Trump's proposed travel ban on seven Muslim countries.\nSome Oscar voters do not see all five nominated foreign films, so Trump assured Asghar his\nOscar.\nI stop by the Women in Film cocktail party at Nightingale Plaza where Meryl Streep announces,\n\"I feel like never saying anything again.\" We hear last year's best actress Brie Larson and\nactivist/documentary nominee Ava DuVernay speak. Back at the Sunset Tower, Livia and Colin\nFirth host their annual dinner for 50 to celebrate The Green Carpet Challenge and The Journey\nto Sustainable Luxury. Spotted: Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, Ruth Negga, Kevin Bacon, Tom\nFord, Salma Hayek, and Mick Jagger. Kyra Sedgwick arrives late from directing her first film,\n\"Story of a Girl,\" starring her husband Kevin Bacon. Kyra sits with Meryl over coffee and says\nhow exciting it is to direct. When I ask Meryl if she will join the minute ranks of female directors,\nthe acting icon says, \"Never. My job is done at the end of the day. I like to go home at night and\nlet someone else worry about tomorrow's location.\"\nFriday ends at the CAA party, a tough ticket now handed out by Maha Dahkil and Michael\nKives. The white tent is filled with a sea of celebrity. Every CAA client comes out to eat, mingle,\nkibbitz and dance. Spotted: Meryl Streep (yes, she had a busy day too), Leonardo DiCaprio,\nScarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Orlando Bloom, Jerry Bruckheimer, J.J. Abrams, Ron\nHoward, Naomi Watts, Mick Jagger, Lady Gaga, Barry Jenkins, John Mayer, Arnold\nSchwarzenegger, Kate Hudson, Jon Hamm and Jeff Bezos.\nAt 2 a.m. I email Damien Chazelle another party report as he is still sick in bed. Now, a team of\nmedical talent is working on getting him well for Oscar night.\nSaturday, February 25\nI march down to the Academy's theater to hear my producer friend (since \"Diner\"), Mark\nJohnson, also an Academy governor, conduct a symposium for four of five nominated foreign\nfilm directors. As brilliant as the conversation was, four guys from Australia, Denmark, Germany\nand Sweden depressingly knew that the absent Iranian Asghar Farhadi was winning.\nI took Mark, instead of the still-quarantined Damien Chazelle, up Coldwater Canyon to Barry\nDiller and Diane von Furstenberg's annual picnic lunch for Graydon Carter and Anna Scott. This\ngathering of the powerful and mighty occurs at exactly the same time as the Independent Spirit\nAwards for young and new talent. The two hot owners of A24, David Fenkel and Daniel Katz,\nare so sure their \"Moonlight\" was winning all six awards they are here instead of the Spirit\nAward’s tent on the beach in Santa Monica. When asked, \"What are you doing here?” they\nsimultaneously say, \"Our people are there.\" The reason they were on the lawn for the first time\nis that they have a new television and film production deal with Diller.\nIt's all very familiar, cozy and the best party of the week. Collectively there are more Oscar and\nEmmy winners on this lawn than will file into the Dolby Theater on Sunday.\nI sit with petite Gloria Cooper, mother of Bradley. She is the only one wearing a hat, a large\nwhite felt fedora hiding enormous black sunglasses and her pretty face. I entertain Gloria with\nlocal gossip, which she loves, but when I ask her for details on the start of production for \"A Star\nis Born,\" I get nothing.\nI ask guests, \"Who is winning best actor\"? They reply, \"Denzel, but I voted for Casey\". Casey,\nwho touched my heart on and off screen, ran in a tight race with humility, despite a nasty\nwhisper campaign against him. I never asked about best picture. I'm still in thrall to the\nconventional wisdom: It's a \"La La\" landslide.\nRupert Murdoch brings his bride Jerry Hall who kisses and chats with Mick Jagger as the lawn\npeople try to eavesdrop. Spotted: DvF's kids Alexander and Tatiana, Sir Howard Stringer, Oliver\nStone, Ted Sarandos, Brett Ratner, Ron Meyer, Tom Ford, Larry Gagosian and Chrissie Erpf,\nJeffrey Katzenberg, George Stevens, Jr., Toby Maguire, Sandy Gallin, Robert Kraft, Harvey\nWeinstein and breathtakingly beautiful Georgina Chapman, Lynn Wyatt, Fran Lebowitz, Henry\nKravis, Jeff and Scott Berg and Irwin Winkler.\nAnother favorite event is Charles Finch's star-studded dinner at Madeo sponsored by Chanel. I\nsit next to Amazon’s Roy Price and Oliver Stone, who sits next to Michael Keaton. I bring over\nPharrell Williams to meet Oliver Stone, director of “Snowden” and “JFK.” The conversation\nsegwayed from Hillary Clinton to Oliver’s new documentary on Putin.\nLily Collins comes over and asks to be introduced to Mick Jagger at the table next to us. She\nsays, \"Tell Mick my father says ‘hello.’\" Lily is the daughter of Phil Collins and starred in Warren\nBeatty's \"Rules Don't Apply\". Mick, never one to pass up a flirt with an Audrey Hepburn lookalike,\nwhispers in her ear that he loved her in the film and was on the set, but sadly missed her.\nSpotted: Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts, Christian Louboutin, Kristen Stewart, Ruth Negga and\n“Arrival” director Denis Villeneuve.\nWendy Stark, daughter of \"Funny Girl\" producer Ray Stark and granddaughter of Fanny Brice,\ninvited me to Jeffrey Katzenberg's Night Before Party on the Fox lot for the Motion Picture\nHome. There is a building named after her father. Walking around with Linda and Jerry\nBruckheimer, I kiss David O. Russell and Colleen Camp. Brian D'Arcy James tells me he may\nreturn to his original role in \"Hamilton\" as King George. I go home with the heaviest swag bag in\nthe world.\nSunday, Feb. 26th\nThe shocking end of the Oscar show continues to mystify me. How could I be so close to every\nfilmmaker and totally miss the upset?\nBecause Damien is still sick, he begs off on his invitation to take me to Guy Oseary's—and\nheads back to bed. As I stand at the end of the Vanity Fair carpet at the entrance to the Wallis\nAnnenberg Center, Casey Affleck arrives holding his Oscar. I ask him to replace Damien as my\nescort and he says, \"Of course. I am leaving in 15 minutes. Don't lose me.” Casey then sends\nme off to find Jimmy Kimmel, who has already left the party. Fifteen minutes turns into an hour\nas everyone wants a selfie with the winner.\nSpotted from “Moonlight”: Barry Jenkins, Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Jeremy Kleiner. From\n“La La Land” Emma Stone and John Legend. From “Manchester by the Sea”, Casey Affleck,\nMichelle Williams, Lucas Hedges and Kenny Lonergan. From “Hidden Figures”: Taraji P.\nHenson, Octavia Spencer and Pharrell Williams, and “Fences” Oscar winner Viola Davis. Also\nswirling around the room: Brie Larson, Dakota Fanning, Elton John, Amy Adams, Jennifer\nAniston, Javier Bardem, Michael Shannon, Alicia Vikander, Scarlett Johansson, Lin-Manuel\nMiranda, Halle Berry, Isabelle Huppert, Michelle Dockery, Faye Dunaway, Andrew Garfield,\nDakota Johnson, Mick Jagger and family, Kelly Ripa, and Patty and Lydia Hearst. I find\nexhausted Oscar show producers Jennifer Todd and Mike De Luca and tell them what a\nwonderful job they did.\nOn the way out, a familiar looking lady keeps waving and smiling at Casey as we wait in the\ncold for cars. I say, \"Casey, that is Monica Lewinsky waving at you.\" Casey is unfazed; he can’t\nwait to get out of the spotlight. Once we reach the Checkpoint Charlie to Guy's party, a team of\ngirls wrapped in wool instructs the driver to lower the window and asks for a name. Casey,\nholding up the Oscar says, \"Affleck.” She says, \"You only have a plus one.\" The real deal is, if\nyou win, you can bring a car full of friends—and eventually we’re cleared for takeoff. Once\ninside we lose each other in the darkness and pulsating Caribbean music. I get home at\n5:00am, pack my three huge suitcases and rush off to the private airport in Van Nuys, still\nwondering how I could have missed “Moonlight”’s triumph. Why couldn’t I see the forest through\nthe trees? I must have been in La La-land.\nxoxo,\nPeggy\nP.S. The following weekend I arrive in the Dominican Republic at Casa de Campo at the home\nof sugar baron Pepe Fanjul and his wife Emilia. Juan Carlos, the past king of Spain, wants to\nwatch a few movies with me. I pulled a dozen DVDs out of my bag and say, \"Your Majesty,\nwhich one\"? He says, \"First, \"La La Land\" for fun, then \"Moonlight\" because it won, then \"The\nFounder\" for American ingenuity.”\n"
