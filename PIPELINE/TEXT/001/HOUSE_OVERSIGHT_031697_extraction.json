As the \nonly 2 sides/2 women show on national radio, we've grown from 16 stations in May of \n2010 to 110 now. \nArianna and Mary find consensus that, contrary to the Washington and media \nconventional wisdom, the Jobs Agenda is more urgent than the Deficit Agenda (\"if people \nonly read about shark attacks, they'll worry about shark attacks,\" says Arianna). And they \nagree that there's an apparent outbreak of men abusing the help -- Strauss-Kahn, \nSchwarzenegger, Ensign. To paraphase Freud, what do men want? \nBut there's sharp disagreement about whether Rep. Ryan walked into Obama's trap by \nproposing to end Medicare in 10 years. Will the special election this Tuesday in Jack \nKemp's old seat produce a Democratic \"Scott Brown Moment\"? \nTo read the show summary and listen, http://www.huffindtonpost.com/huff-radio/both-\nsides-now-1st-annive b 865325.html  \nBest, \nMark Green \nHost \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031697 \nYou are currently subscribed to markgreen as: \nAdd mark@markgreen.com to your email address book to ensure delivery \nForward to a Friend I Manage Subscription I Subscribe I Unsubscribe \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031698 \n"
