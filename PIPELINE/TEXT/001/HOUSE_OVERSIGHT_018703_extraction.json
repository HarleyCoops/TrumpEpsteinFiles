    "full_text": "﻿The Game: All Things Trump\nAndres Serrano\n\"In the history of science the collector of specimens\npreceded the zoologist and followed the exponents of\nnatural theology and magic….. However lowly, the work\nof the collector must be done, before he can proceed to\nthe higher scientific tasks of classification, analysis,\nexperiment and theory making.\"\nAldous Huxley from Heaven and Hell\nBefore Donald Trump was President, he was Donald Trump.\nThis is a portrait of that man.\nIn his first non-photography based installation, Andres Serrano\ntakes us on a curious and insightful tour for a closer look at who\nDonald Trump is.\nIn a relatively short period of eight weeks with a determination\nand competitive ferocity worthy of its subject, the artist has\namassed a collection of over 500 objects produced by or for\nDonald Trump.\nThe collection is telling and varies from objects as mundane as\nshirts, ties, suits, hats, jackets, ice buckets, Teddy Bears and\nminiature screwdriver sets made for Donald Trump, his brand,\nhis casinos, his hotels, to Trump Tea, Trump Coffee, Trump Ice\nWater, Trump Coca-Cola, Trump 7-Up, Trump Snapple, and\nthe more exotic $1,000 Trump Steaks (“The Best!”), Trump\nVodka packed in 24 carat gold plated bottles, a Trump deodorant\nnamed “Success” and a Trump cologne called “Empire.”\nIn addition to the merchandise for Trump Plaza, Trump Harrah’s\nCasino, Trump Marina, Trump Castle, Trump Tai Mahal,\nTrump University and Trump Shuttle there are casino chips,\nboxing invites, concert invites and many many more objects all\nbearing the name “Trump.”\nThis colorful collection is mostly self-explanatory but the artist\nplans to present each object with a museum-like label not unlike\nin a curiosity cabinet or an anthropological study room.\nOf particular interest are more than fifty magazines with Donald\nTrump on the cover. Although, most of the magazines are ten,\ntwenty or more years old, there are some more recent ones\nincluding a copy of The Atlantic from June 2016 with the cover\nstory, “The Mind Of Donald Trump,” Time Magazine’s issue\n“Deal with it” from August 21, 2015 and another Time Magazine\ndated March 14, 2016 with the words “bully, showman, party\ncrasher and demagogue” written across Donald Trump’s face.\nAll three magazines are signed by Donald Trump.\nAlso included are several high priced special edition items made\nfor VIP’s such as a beautiful Taj Mahal leather jacket and a Taj\nMahal Golf Bag and Clubs as well as a 1994 Trump Castle Casino\nBirthday Invitation titled, “Trump, Lord Of The Financial Jungle.”\nThe centerpiece of the installation is a sizable portrait of Donald\nTrump taken by Andres Serrano in 2004 for his “America” series\nand a giant rotating sculpture below it. The sculpture, which is\nmore than 10 feet tall, is the word, EGO, spelled vertically, an\nelegant sign that once greeted visitors at the entrance of Trump’s\nTaj Mahal Casino's Ego Lounge.\nFinally, there are several board games including “Trump\nMonopoly,” “The Apprentice Game” and “Trump: The Game.”\nThe premise of “The Game” is stated on the box.\n“It’s not whether you win or lose, it’s whether you win.”\nThere are different versions of “The Game,” including one in\nFrench, all to be laid out in several locations in the gallery under\nglass.\nWhat kind of game was it, or is it? Who wins, and who loses?\nThat’s for the audience to decide. The artist prefers to stay neutral.\n“It’s a portrait of a man painted with his own brushes,” says\nAndres Serrano.\nDonald Trump Signature Collection crest Striped 100%\nSilk Neck Ties\nDonald Trump Signature Collection Dress Shirt\nTrump Taj Mahal Sweatshirt\nTrump International Hotel And Tower\nLas Vegas Hoodie\nTrump Castle Jacket\n1990 Trump Taj Mahal Leather Jacket.\nGiven to a select few when the casino opened.
