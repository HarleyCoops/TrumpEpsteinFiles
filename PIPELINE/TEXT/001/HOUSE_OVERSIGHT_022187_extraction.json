We are trying to determine whether there is any \ntruth to the allegations that either or both of these men may have had sexual relations with minors \nwhile there. We know that you have been Epstein's pilot, so we're wondering if you would be willing \nto speak with us completely off the record. We are not focusing on the allegations against Epstein --\nwe are solely focusing on Trump and Clinton given the current allegations being levied in the press. \nIf you don't feel comfortable sharing anything via social media or email, feel free to send us any \ndocumentation/proof that might be helpful anonymously via mail: \nMelanie Hicken \n6430 Sunset Blvd #300 \nLos Angeles, CA 90028 \nYou can also reach us by phone: \nThanks so much, \nMelanie \nNot \ninterested \nView Melanie's Linked In profile \nYou are receiving InMail notification emails.
