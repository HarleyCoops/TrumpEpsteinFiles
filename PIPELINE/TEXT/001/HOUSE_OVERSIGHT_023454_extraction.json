He referenced \"The Age Of Wonder\", by Richard Holmes, in which the first Romantic Age \ndescribed by Holmes was centered on chemistry and poetry, while Dyson pointed out that this new age is \ndominated by computational biology. Its leaders, he noted, include \"biology wizards\" Kary Mullis, Craig \nVenter, medical engineer Dean Kamen; and \"computer wizards\" Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Charles \nSimonyi. He pointed out that the nexus for this intellectual activity — the Lunar Society for the 21st century — \nis centered around the activities of EDGE. \n>> \n>> Dyson continued to articulate his vision for a new age of biology in a related review inNew York Review of \nBooks in which he wrote: \"...a new generation of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron wrote \nverses, might create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and trees and birds to enrich the ecology of our \nplanet. Most of these artists would be amateurs, but they would be in close touch with science, like the poets of \nthe earlier Age of Wonder. The new Age of Wonder might bring together wealthy entrepreneurs like Venter \nand Kamen ... and a worldwide community of gardeners and farmers and breeders, working together to make \nthe planet beautiful as well as fertile, hospitable to hummingbirds as well as to humans.\" \n>> \n>> So, along these lines, who can best articulate the important issues questions we face today than the very \npeople who are, through their ideas and entrepreneurial zeal, changing the very nature of reality itself. Here's \nthe 2012 Annual Question. Before sending it out widely to the list, it's useful to seed the project with a dozen or \nso interesting responses to provide examples and set a high bar. Even better, to inspire. How about it?? Hope to \nhear from you.

These explanations are called \"beautiful\" or \"elegant\". Historical \nexamples are Kepler's explanation of complex planetary motions as simple ellipses, Bohr's explanation of the \nperiodic table of the elements in terms of electron shells, and Watson and Crick's double helix. Einstein \nfamously said that he did not need experimental confirmation of his general theory of relativity because it \"was \nso beautiful it had to be true.\" \n>> The EDGE Question 2012 \n>> WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DEEP, ELEGANT, OR BEAUTIFUL EXPLANATION? \n>> Since this question is about explanation, answers may embrace scientific thinking in the broadest sense: as \nthe most reliable way of gaining knowledge about anything, including other fields of inquiry such as \nphilosophy, mathematics, economics, history, political theory, literary theory, or the human spirit. The only \nrequirement is that some simple and non-obvious idea explain some diverse and complicated set of phenomena. \n>> [Thanks to Steven Pinker for suggesting this year's EDGE Question and to Stewart Brand, Kevin Kelly, and \nGeorge Dyson for their ongoing advice and support.] \n>> \n>>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n>> \"Open-minded, free ranging, intellectually playful ... an unadorned pleasure in curiosity, a collective \nexpression of wonder at the living and inanimate world ... an ongoing and thrilling colloquium.\" \n>> —Ian McEwan in THE TELEGRAPH \n>>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n>> SUBMITTING ESSAYS: Email as text or attached Word file to me (brockman@edge.org). \n>> DUE DATE: 5pm, Thursday, January 12th \n>> PUBLICATION DATE: 12am EST, Sunday, January 15th \n>> URL: Essays will be posted at this draft URL (not visible to search engines).

But give it a rest for this exercise and \nplease avoid citing your own theory, idea, explanation. Also, think of examples that are not completely \nobvious—we don't want a hundred people nominating natural selection, or relativity, or Turing machines. \n>> Say something new, true, and interesting based on your own experience, in 1,000 words or less. \n>> Go deeper than the news. Tell us something we don't know. This is not a purely scientific question: this is \nquestion about our culture and ourselves. The ideas we present on EDGE can offer a new set of metaphors to \ndescribe ourselves, our minds, the way we think, the world, and all of the things we know in it. \n>> \n>> As usual, no politics (\"Democrat\" \"Republican\") or politicians (\"Obama\" \"Romney\" \"Clinton\" \"Gingrich\", \netc.). No editorials, Op-eds, opinion pieces, flippancy. No ad hominem comments. No self-promotion: no \nreferencing your books, papers, courses. No \"selling from the stage\", pushing your well-known agenda. No \nfootnotes, credits, or hyperlinks in the text: stay on the page. No anecdotes about spouses, significant others, \nkids, family pets. Write a stand-alone piece: don't respond to the pieces of other contributors already posted. \n>> This is the annual opportunity for the EDGE community to give something back, to provide an important \npublic service, to make a statement by presenting uncompromisingly sophisticated science-minded thinking to \na wide global audience. Be imaginative, exciting, compelling, inspiring. Tell a great story. Make an argument \nthat makes a difference. Amaze and delight. Surprise us! \n>> \n>> \n>> TO THE EDGE PRESS LIST \n>> Last year's EDGE Question (\"What Scientific Concept Would Improve Everybody's Cognitive Toolkit?\" - \nhttp://goo.gl/bEzNP - generated 165 essays (115,000 words) and received global press attention - \nhttp://goo.g1/Ygxs7 \n>> For some background on how the EDGE Annual Questions comes together, check out \"A Big Question\", an \narticle I wrote for the Nieman Foundation in 2010 - http://goo.gliudnZg \n>> We expect at least as many contributions this year. Please feel free use up to 1,500 words of text (gratis) \nwithout further permission, provided that: \n>> (a) EDGE and its URL (www.edge.org) are mentioned in the first paragraph of your print and online piece; \nand \n>> (b) a hyperlink to the EDGE home page (http://www.edge.org) is provided in the first paragraph of your \nonline edition. \n>> Edge Foundation, Inc. is a nonprofit private operating foundation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \nRevenue Code. \n>> Happy New Year! \n>> John Brockman \n>> Editor & Publisher \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023456 \n>> It's ever more delectable that EDGE-the network of prominent scientists and intellectuals— has worked \nagainst the reciprocal ignorance of literary cultures and sciences of each other. Successfully. If you take the \nalgorithms developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, which measure the value of links, EDGE'S website ranks \nseven on a global scale often. THE NEW YORK TIMES ranks nine, eBay at eight. \n>> — SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023457 \n"
