    "full_text": "______• May 20, 1997 \nDonald Trump's instincts regarding Jeffrey Epstein were solid. Rut if \nthe reporters who were beginning to look into Epstein's mysterious \nbackground had dug a bit further, there's a chalice they would have hit \npay dirt as well—and not just in Palm Beach. \nIn California, for instance, a paper trail already stretched from the \nSanta Monica Police Department to Epstein's front door. \nIn the spring—almost the summer—of 1997, a call came in to the \npolice. The young woman who placed it—a young actress who'd \nappeared on Baywatch and General Hospital—said she'd been sexually \nassaulted at a trendy hotel called Shutters on the Beach. \nThe officer who took the call knew the woman's name—\nand her voice. A week earlier, she'd told him about an encounter with \nEpstein. The worliall had not wanted to make a formal complaint at the \ntime. But she had taken the cop's card, and now he was happy to hear \nthat she'd changed her mind. \nIn a shaky voice, described Epstein as a tallish man—five feet \neleven or six feet in height was her guess—with gray hair and brown \neyes. He was the owner of a large black four-door Mercedes and was a \nregular at Shutters on the Beach, which was the kind of place that cost \none thousand dollars a night and was frequented by actors, agents, and \nother Hollywood types. \ntold the cop that she was a model and actress herself. She'd \nknown Epc;i0in for about a month They had a friend in common, and \nshe'd sent him her head shots. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031191 \n"
