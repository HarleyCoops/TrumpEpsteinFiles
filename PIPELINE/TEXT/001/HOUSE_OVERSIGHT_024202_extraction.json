Executive Summary\nThis White Paper discusses Electron Capital’s (“Electron”) views on the global utility sector and outlines why\nnow is a particularly advantageous time for long/short investing in the sector using Electron’s research\napproach that focuses on structural change.\nElectron’s 5 investment professionals, working together an average of 6 years, have generated a 7‐year track\nrecord of long/short investing in the global utility sector. Returns have annualized 10.3% and have been\ncharacterized by strong alpha generation (80% of returns; Jensen’s alpha calculation) in a dismally‐performing\nglobal sector (‐0.2% absolute).\nElectron will continue its approach with the Electron Global Fund, an absolute return product. (See\nAppendices 1 and 2 for Electron’s process and the sector’s history.)\nElectron invests in a deep universe of utility and infrastructure stocks, comprising 375 companies with a\nmarket cap of $2.8 trillion. Our approach is truly global as 40‐60% of the portfolio’s historical gross has been\nallocated outside the US. Stocks covered include the electric, gas, water and waste utilities in addition to\ninfrastructure companies (defined as those levered to utilities or utility‐like). For the sake of simplicity, the\nrest of this White Paper will focus on the electric utilities, the largest subsector; we refer to this subsector\nwhen we reference “utility”.\n� Advantageous time to be long/short investing in the global utility sector (Section 2).\no Structural change in the sector has been accelerating after a recession‐induced slowdown.\no Long‐only investors are not positioned for such structural change in what is the world’s most\nunderweight sector.\no We believe hedge fund investors have already begun to make this turn as evidenced by a\nsignificant increase in net exposure over the last 6 months.\n� Structural changes will drive the largest alpha opportunities in all major regions (Section 3).\no US utilities will face the strongest headwinds, yet structural change will occur which will drive\nalpha opportunities. We believe the most interesting US structural changes will have a magnified\neffect internationally given commodity interlinkages.\no European and Asian utilities offer the most abundant and attractive alpha opportunities.\no Japan and Latam will be more trading markets over the near term.\n� Some structural changes will have a global impact (Section 4).\no The shale gas and coal price washout (with its knock‐on effect on global power prices) is largely\nover; the global utility sector has substantial optionality to any increase in power prices due to\nnatural gas and coal prices, which will be heavily influenced by trends in the US.\n• On the supply side, US spot gas at $3.42/mmbtu is below the breakeven full‐cycle\nnatural gas production cost of $3.50‐4.00/mmbtu. We believe this provides downside\nprotection to the current gas price despite the proliferation of shale gas.\n• Potential additional demand for natural gas is enormous:\n� In the US power sector (37% of demand), EPA mandates will force coal plant\nclosures (e.g. potentially adding 10% to natural gas demand) and increase the\nmarginal switching cost for the most efficient plants to $4/mmbtu, providing a\nrunway for structurally higher gas demand/prices.\n� Other large potential structural sources of demand arise from LNG exports\n(also 10% of US demand), a gas‐intensive industrial renaissance (also 10%), and\nsubstitution of LNG/CNG for oil‐based vehicle fuels.\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n3\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\no\n• Leverage to higher power prices can be substantial. For example, in the US every\n$1/mmbtu improvement in natural gas prices increases Exelon’s long‐term earnings by\nmore than 20%, whereas for pure generators such as NRG the leverage exceeds 30%.\n• In Europe, where power is generated at close to cash production cost in many markets,\neven a modest (e.g. 10%) combination of changes in coal, carbon and Euro prices can\nhave a 25‐50% earnings impact on several European utilities.\nGlobal utility capex (ex‐US) is rebounding after a recession‐driven slowdown:\n• System‐enhancing transmission capex is accelerating in Europe and Asia and is firm in\nthe US.\n• US, European and Asian utilities are building much of the infrastructure needed to\ncapitalize on the global shale gas boom underway.\n• In emerging markets, infrastructure spending is occurring across the entire value chain.\n� Substantial alpha opportunities follow periods of underperformance (Section 5).\no Current MSCI World Utility Index underperformance against the MSCI World Index is the deepest\n(‐67%) and longest (4 years) of the modern utility era, caused by a perfect storm of factors (see\npage 15).\no Despite the strong rally in equity markets since the depths of the financial crisis, the global utility\nsector is still down ‐11% in absolute terms and has underperformed the second‐worst sector\n(telecom) over the same period by ‐23%. Previous periods of underperformance have set the\nstage for substantial alpha opportunities driven by fundamental investors re‐entering the sector.\no The global utility sector does not need to outperform for Electron to generate solid performance;\n80% of our 7‐year return (10.3% per annum) is from alpha (Jensen’s alpha calculation).\n� Investing in the global utility sector does not mean taking undue interest rate risk (Section 6).\no The interest rate sensitivity of the sector has declined steadily since the modern utility era began\nin the early 1990s. US utilities remain the most interest rate‐sensitive companies regionally.\no We track interest rate risk for all positions in our risk model, and the portfolio’s net interest rate\nrisk is kept within acceptable limits as we select stocks. In addition, Electron’s return correlation\nto interest rates historically is slightly lower than the HFRI Equity Hedge Index’s return\ncorrelation to interest rates.\no This process has worked well for us as Electron has posted strong returns and alpha generation in\nboth increasing and declining interest rate environments.\n�\nInvestors should always have an allocation to the global utility sector.\no This is a large‐cap, dividend‐generating sector that is vitally important to national economies, and\nwhich is subject to undercurrents of deregulation and competition. This has produced ample\nlong/short opportunities in the past and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\no Moreover, an allocation to global utilities provides a diversification benefit to investor\nportfolios. The risks affecting a global utility sector fund are very different from those affecting\nother long/short funds and diversification enables higher returns per unit of risk. Electron’s 7‐\nyear track record correlation to the S&P 500 and HFRI Equity Hedge indices is .41 and .68,\nrespectively (.18 and .55, respectively, in down markets).\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n4\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\n2. Structural Change – Advantageous Time for Global Utility Sector Long/Short Investing\nThe high level of structural change occurring around the globe makes this a particularly advantageous time\nto be long/short investing in the global utility sector. The various examples for each region, the importance\nof structural change to each region and the opportunities are listed in Section 3.\n�\nStructural Change in Electron’s Research Process\nSince the original Electron was formed in 2004, Electron’s research process has focused on structural\nchange to determine its impact on the underlying future earnings potential of our companies (see\nAppendix 1, page 22). Whenever there is structural change, distortions and inefficiencies arise. These\ninvariably result in both winners and losers among utility stocks, in large part because of the heavy\ninfluence of public policy on the sector (e.g. governments and regulators). Policymakers will never want to\nknowingly provide windfall profits to utilities; if a structural change is producing a winner, we look for the\nloser. If a loser cannot be found, we keep looking: the loser will eventually surface.\n�\nStructural Change Cycle\nAs cycles are an important feature of life, so are cycles of structural change important in the global\nindustry. During the recession following the financial crisis, the activity level of structural change did\nslow down around the globe. This is not surprising as governments, regulators and other stakeholders\nslowed the pace of structural change (i.e. a hunkering down mentality took hold among utility\nstakeholders) and companies slowed their rate of capital spending (because of uncertain economic\ngrowth prospects). As time has passed, the outlook for global growth has stabilized, tail risks have been\nmanaged and confidence has returned, and companies have begun spending previously‐delayed capex\nneeded to ensure system reliability. This collectively has prompted utility stakeholders to pick up the\npace of structural change. Given that we track structural change globally, we estimate that this inflection\npoint of increased structural change occurred approximately 12‐18 months ago.\n�\nInvestors Not Positioned for Structural Change Pickup\nThat we are at an inflection point for a pickup in structural change is underappreciated by the market.\nMoreover, it is occurring at a time when there are fewer eyes focused on global utilities. The\nunderappreciated pickup in structural change activity levels combined with low investor involvement\nspells opportunity for the Electron Global Fund as it plays to the Electron team’s competitive advantage.\nThis driver was critical to the investment professionals’ decision to re‐launch the independent Electron.\no\nLong‐Only Investors Substantially Underweight but Hedge Funds Turning\nThe global utility sector is the world’s most‐underweight sector by a large margin. Moreover, the\nunderweighting has dipped to a comparably extreme level only 4 times (including now) over the last\n10 years. Each time this extreme has been crossed, over the next 24 months global utilities rose by\n38% on an absolute basis and outperformed the global broad market by 20%, on average.\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n5\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nGlobal Sector Positioning\nSubstantially\nunderweight\nSource: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Fund Manager Survey, Feb 12, 2013\nNet % Overweight Global Utilities\n+1σ underweight vs mean\n‐1σ underweight vs mean\nRed circle =\ncrossing below\n1σ underweight\nSource: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Fund Manager Survey, Feb 12, 2013\nThe sector has been not only a substantial long‐only underweight, but also a wholesale short for\nmany macro/generalist hedge funds. However, it is very interesting to note that an inflection point\nappears to have occurred in the middle of 2012, with hedge funds increasing their net exposure to\nthe global utility sector after a long period of reducing net. The long/short ratio of utility stocks held\nby hedge funds fell from 3.0x in Jan 08 to about 1.7x in Jan 12 (4 years), but has since risen by 60% to\n2.7x, which is more than twice the increase for hedge funds’ overall net exposure during the same\nperiod (source: Goldman Sachs).\nBased on discussions with the Street, it appears that this short exposure has been expressed via ETFs,\nregional utility indices or large bellwether index utility proxies. Individual name crowdedness has\ncontinued to remain at a low level (e.g., utilities rarely show up Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP list –\nticker GSTHHVIP). Today, utilities account for the lowest in gross assets held of the 10 global\nsectors. (Source: Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund Trend Monitor analysis of 700 hedge funds with $1.3\ntrillion in gross assets.)\nIn addition, global QE programs have boosted demand for higher‐beta stocks, which has contributed\nto the recent relative underperformance of and lack of interest in utilities. However (see below), the\nunderperformance of US utilities has diminished with each successive QE round (QE1\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n6\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nunderperformance ‐39%, QE2 ‐12%, QE3 ‐5%), which signals exhaustion of selling pressure as the\nrelative value of the S&P versus utilities has stretched further. Given widespread use of QE, a similar\neffect can be found in other regions.\nUS Utilities Price/S&P 500 Price\nSource: Bloomberg\n3. Regional Structural Changes Driving Alpha Opportunity\nStructural changes are occurring in all regions. Those in which Electron is currently investing or tracking closely\nare as follows:\n�\nUS Utilities\nOf the global utility markets, we expect the US utilities market to face the strongest headwinds and be\nthe least‐attractive market for alpha generation over the next 2 years. Since the financial crisis, the US\nhas been the best‐performing region for utilities of all the developed markets, outperforming European\nutilities by 40% over the last 4 years, and it is the region which is only slightly underweight by investors.\nThe US is the most defensive of all regions because of the large weighting of regulated names. Since 2008,\nUS utility earnings have been flat (versus a ‐45% decline in Europe), as consistent regulated earnings\ngrowth of 3‐5% offset unregulated utility earnings declines resulting from lower power prices driven by\nfalling natural gas prices. Notwithstanding flat earnings growth, investors have re‐rated the US utility\nsector’s PE multiple relative to the S&P as they sought more yield in a low‐yielding QE environment.\nToday, US utilities are close to the sector’s pre‐crisis record valuation peak (trading at a 7% PE premium to\nthe S&P 500) when investors were discounting higher earnings growth from tightening power markets\n(see below).\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n7\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nClose to record\nrelative PE\nSource: Bloomberg\nWhile we will continue to see solid growth from the regulated names, and a total return argument can\nstill be made that justifies the current premium valuation of US utilities, we do see capex growth starting\nto level off. This is the opposite of what will happen in Europe and Asia, where we expect regulatory capex\nto increase. Moreover, we believe US utility regulators will continue to pressure returns on equity\n(ROEs) as interest rates remain low. We believe there is greater opportunity among companies with nonregulated\npower generation assets, as we expect firm natural gas and thus power prices to flow through\nto earnings. Note, for example, that every $1/mmbtu improvement in natural gas prices would increase\nExelon’s long‐term earnings by more than 20%, whereas for pure generators such as NRG the leverage\nexceeds 30%.\nBelow is a partial list of structural changes driving long/short opportunities in the US:\nElectron’s structural changes: US\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\nCoal retirements’ impact on power markets\nChange in competitive generation market structure as a result of the shale gas boom\nTransmission spending to integrate renewables/improve reliability, and its impact on power prices\nObama initiatives on climate change legislation, and the EPA threat\nEnergy efficiency initiatives – utility uncoupling , demand growth\nNuclear assets facing closure – impact on power markets\nRenewables’ power markets distortions (impact on peak and off‐peak power prices)\nIncreased infrastructure spending to move shale gas from basins\nLNG export impact on gas and power markets\nRegulatory ROE changes with low rates, higher capex, declining load growth, commodity price changes\nIncreased generator retail selling versus wholesale\nCapacity market in TX, CA\nState generation subsidy impacts on capacity markets\nM&A and asset divestitures’ impact on power markets and utility risk profiles\nOil‐to‐gas residential switching\nElectric vehicle demand impact\nRegional load growth changes – manufacturing renaissance, state taxes, etc.\n8\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\n�\nEuropean Utilities\nWe believe European utilities have the potential not only for the strongest outperformance but also for\nthe greatest alpha generation. Since the financial crisis, European utility earnings have declined\napproximately ‐45% which is slightly less than European broader market earnings declines of ‐51% (Stoxx\n600 or SXXP) and ‐58% (Stoxx 50 or SX5E). Prior to the crisis, European utilities used to trade at a 20%\npremium to the broader market. During the recovery, European utilities suffered a ‐43% derating and\nnow trade at a 31% PE discount to the broader market. Most of this derating is explained by the\nEuropean utilities’ lack of participation in the European broad market PE multiple re‐rating (SX5E +115%,\nSXXP +76%) since the recovery beginning in 2009. Moreover, approximately 40% of the sector is now\ntrading below book value.\nClearly, investors appear to believe that earnings have troughed for European companies broadly, but not\nfor European utilities. Concerns about political intervention along with low power and carbon prices have\nprevented a re‐rating of the sector. However, we are comfortable that we are close to a bottom, and that\noptionality is asymmetrically skewed to the upside for the European utilities, as many generation assets\nare producing power at close to cash cost.\nRelative to US utilities, European utilities have underperformed by ‐40% and the relative PE has de‐rated\nby ‐11% since the crisis. The average European utility’s relative dividend yield is now 95% higher than that\nof US peers before the crisis. Although some would argue that dividend cuts are coming (we agree\nbroadly, and see several interesting short opportunities), we do not see the entire sector’s dividends\nbeing cut by 50%, as stock prices imply. As such, the sector today has dividend support even though some\ndividend cuts will undoubtedly happen.\nIn addition to dividends, potentially higher power prices from both higher European coal and carbon\nprices could also provide support. At present, the carbon market (EU ETS) in Europe is dysfunctional, with\ncarbon trading at €5/tonne, well below the cost required to spur investment in low‐carbon generating\ncapacity. We expect the carbon market to be restructured (already being discussed), thus raising the\nprice of carbon and increasing power prices. Moreover, with China’s GDP growth reaccelerating and 70%\nof the resulting rise in electricity production generated from coal, we would anticipate a modest growth in\ncoal consumption in the Asian seaborne market, thereby supporting South African and European coal\nprices. Given our view of rising US natural gas prices, we expect coal exports from the US to Europe to\nfall. These are all factors that should support European coal prices even before accounting for greater\ndemand for coal that might come from Europe should growth return. Notwithstanding, short\nopportunities will remain in several European markets due to the influence of renewables.\nMoreover, if the European Central Bank were to lower its Main Refinancing Operations rate, currently 75\nbps, and provide other monetary policy support, we would expect not only increased demand for\nelectricity (which would increase coal consumption) but also a weaker Euro would increase the Euro price\nof coal (in Europe) and thus power prices. There are a number of factors at work here, and it is difficult to\npredict levels with any degree of accuracy, but even small changes would have a significant impact on\nthe sector. For example, a combination of a +10% increase in coal prices, ‐10% decrease in the Euro/$\nexchange rate, and a rise in the carbon credit price from €5 to €10/tonne would produce 25‐50% earnings\nupside in many continental European utilities.\nBelow is a partial list of structural changes driving long/short opportunities in Europe:\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n9\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nElectron’s structural changes: Europe\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\nEU energy efficiency directive and load growth\nEU ETS (carbon market) changes\nRenewables build and power market distortions\nMismatches between tariff rises and costs/capex\nInfrastructure spending impact on energy costs and power/gas competition\nUK capacity markets\nLarge combustion plant directive (LCPD) (UK)\nPower market impact of nuclear phase outs (Germany) and new nuclear build (UK)\nPolitical interference on the continent (taxes, return formulas, tariffs)\nM&A, divestitures, privatizations’ impact on power markets and changing utilities’ risk profiles\nBifurcation of sector valuation because of WACC changes\nEuropean gas price delinkage from oil\nOngoing renegotiation of Gazprom contracts\nEuropean utility non‐regulated investments moving offshore\nErosion of the Italian power price premium\nNew Italian water regulations\nShale gas potential in Europe\nImplementation of Russian RAB‐based regulation\nElectric vehicles\n�\nAsian Utilities\nThe Asian utility sector is a tale of two worlds. One enjoys a stable regulatory environment and solid\npower purchase agreements, as in Hong Kong and Thailand; the other is a victim of government\nintervention, as in Korea and China. The two worlds can coexist in the same country, for example in\nMalaysia where independent power producers enjoy solid power purchase agreements while utility\nTenaga, which is a large employer and which faces the consumer directly, suffers from political meddling.\nCapex cycles and potential regulatory changes, respectively, tend to dominate performance of the two\nsides. For example, Korea Electric Power has outperformed sharply at times in the past on even small\nsteps toward fuel cost passthrough implementation. In India’s chaotic power markets, outperformance\ncould arise from even small steps toward implementation of urgently‐needed reform, e.g. any movement\nto improve access to fuel supply (notably coal) for independent power producers. The dichotomy\nbetween the two “worlds” of the Asian utility sector provides ample opportunities to generate alpha.\nThe vast population and developing nature of the region, and consequent issues of energy security and\nenvironmental sustainability, create additional forces for structural change. For example, as China\nincreasingly promotes natural gas usage, we will see gradual pricing reform, more natural gas imports,\ngreater natural gas vehicle adoption and accelerating shale gas development.\nBelow is a partial list of structural changes driving long/short opportunities in Asia‐Pacific (ex‐Japan):\n10\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nElectron’s structural changes: Asia‐Pacific ex‐Japan\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\nChina power market policy changes to address record pollution levels\nImpact on China’s power market of selective coal plant approvals\nAccelerating development of shale gas in China\nUrgently‐needed power reform in India to address fuel, power tariff and grid issues\nPotential carbon trading and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) in China\nIncreasing promotion of natural gas usage and price reform in China\nFuel cost passthrough implementation amid a potential power shortage in Korea\nContinued support for nuclear power by China – new‐build approval delay impact\nIncreased robustness of fuel cost passthrough regimes\nIndian import duties on equipment\nIncreasing pressure on electricity tariffs in HK\nRising Australian domestic gas prices on LNG export arbitrage\nAustralian carbon market future\nConsolidation of the Australian supply market into an oligopoly\nAustralian state regulatory evolution (e.g., electricity in Queensland)\n�\nJapanese Utilities\nThe impact of the Fukushima incident on Japanese utilities will last for years. Nuclear policy will continue\nto be reviewed – notably the decision whether to restart nuclear power plants – which will affect the\nutilities’ long‐term fuel mix and therefore cost base.\nFor example, Kansai Electric Power, which has the largest exposure to nuclear generation after Tokyo\nElectric, stopped paying dividends after the nuclear shutdown. Every 1% change in its nuclear fleet\nutilization rate will affect earning by almost 10% over a normalized level; nuclear policy decisions can thus\ncreate outcomes for share prices of +/‐ 50%.\nThe ripples from changing nuclear policy will have a long‐lasting impact, both negative and positive, on\ncompanies involved in the nuclear value chain (e.g., reactor manufacturers such as Mitsubishi Heavy) and\nother power‐related sectors such as gas and renewable energy. Relative to other regions, Japanese\nutilities will be the most affected by macro factors (e.g. the Yen, interest rates, fossil fuel prices, etc.).\nBelow is a partial list of structural changes driving long/short opportunities in Japan:\nElectron’s structural changes: Japan\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\nFukushima incident’s impact on Japan’s power‐related sectors such as LNG and power equipment\nDerating of sector as a result of the government’s response to Fukushima\nRestart of nuclear plants with Abe administration and prefecture support\nFuel cost impact from Yen depreciation\nMovement to higher value‐added renewable energy systems\n11\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\n�\nLatam Utilities\nLatin America will be a trading market for the next year or two.

Global Structural Changes Driving Alpha Opportunity\nIn addition to region‐specific structural changes, there are structural changes that have a global impact on the\nutility sector.\n�\nPower Prices are Skewed to the Upside\nThe cost of natural gas and coal sets the marginal power price in many power markets around the globe.\nThe rapid rise in US shale production that began in 2007 caused domestic gas prices to decline much more\nrapidly than other fuels and put downward pressure on power prices both in the US and globally. For US\ngas‐fired generator Calpine, lower fuel costs offset lower power prices and the company emerged a\nrelative winner. Virtually all other US generators employ a mix of assets fired by costlier fuels and suffered\na tremendous margin squeeze, with – in the most extreme example – coal‐fired generator Dynegy\ndeclaring bankruptcy in 2012. We believe the downward trend in US natural gas prices has flattened for\nreasons noted below, and upward optionality remains, which will affect power prices not only in the US\nbut also Europe and Asia given cross‐border commodity linkages.\nIn Europe, in an example of the regional, non‐correlated character of the global utility sector, a quite\ndifferent dynamic has taken shape, with coal‐generated power margins remaining attractive relative to\nnatural gas‐fired generation margins. Coal prices in Europe have declined as a result of cheaper US and\nColombian coal imports (because of US shale gas) and the knock‐on effect of softening Asian coal prices.\nCarbon costs (i.e. EU ETS) embedded in power prices also have declined, from €16/tonne 2 years ago to\n€5/tonne today, largely as a result of the European recession. With European natural gas prices at 3x US\nprices (unlike in the US, natural gas prices in Europe are linked by convention to oil), European utilities\nhave been minimizing natural gas generation and maximizing coal generation. So, unlike the situation in\nthe US, coal generators such as Drax in the UK have enjoyed better margins on higher power output (see\nbelow) as gas plants sit underutilized.\n12\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nSource: Bloomberg, Electron Capital Partners\nWe believe a floor price exists for natural gas despite shale production. We fully acknowledge that the\nUS has large reserves of shale gas awaiting development. However, the current spot price ($3.42/mmbtu)\nsits below the breakeven full‐cycle cost of most US basins ($3.50‐$4.00/mmbtu), which has led producers\nto focus on liquids‐rich plays and de‐emphasize dry‐gas production. Accordingly, the gas rig count is at a\ndecade low and the Energy Information Administration expects gas production to be flat through 2014.\nWith the wide spread between oil and U.S. natural gas prices likely to continue, we expect the growth in\nliquids shale production to remain much higher than gas.\nOn the demand side, the power sector is the largest consumer (37%) of natural gas in the US. At prices\nbelow $5/mmbtu, coal switching begins, and at prices below $3/mmbtu, gas‐fired power generating units\nbecome competitive against even the most efficient coal units. Importantly, the breakeven point for coalto‐gas\nswitching will rise materially due to EPA mandates. By 2015, these standards move the breakeven\npoint for the most efficient coal units from $3/mmbtu to approximately $4/mmbtu, close to where\ncurrent forward prices sit.\nLarge potential structural changes in demand create upside optionality. There has been much media\nfocus on the growth of shale gas production, so much so that we believe potential demand drivers are\nunderappreciated. For example, currently‐planned US coal plant retirements, if repowered with gas,\nwould support an additional 6 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of gas demand, adding nearly 10% to total\nUS demand. In addition, we see the potential for LNG exports to exceed another 6 bcf/d (27 bcf/d of\nproject capacity awaits US Department of Energy approval). Cheap gas is also spurring an industrial\nresurgence, with new petrochemical plants being proposed in the Gulf and traditional coal users such as\nsteel mills contemplating refiring their facilities with gas instead of metallurgical coal. Longer term, LNG\nas a vehicle fuel substitute for long haul trucks and CNG for lighter vehicles could also add materially to\ngas demand. Given the number of possible structural demand changes and the enormous potential from\neach, we believe the optionality for natural gas prices is clearly to the upside.\nWe believe the recent trend of softer US natural gas prices leading to a deflationary impact on global\nutility sector earnings is, then, largely played out. Longer‐term, we see many positive demand\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n13\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nfundamentals that are supportive of higher natural gas prices; while we don’t expect a return to the\ncommodity boom times of 2003‐2007, a turn in trend will be very supportive of higher share prices.\n�\nCapex (ex‐US) is Rebounding Post‐Recession\nCapital spending precedes earnings, and utility capex (ex‐US) is rebounding after a recession‐driven\nslowdown. In particular, transmission spending is accelerating in Europe (Germany, Spain, France) and\nAsia while remaining firm in the US. Transmission capex not only enhances system reliability but also\nsystem efficiency, by enabling the delivery of the most efficient generation to meet demand. Many\ntransmission grids face bottlenecks because of the inclusion of intermittent renewable generation in areas\nwith ample wind and solar resources but located far from customers. Companies such as Northeast\nUtilities (US), National Grid (UK) and Elia (Belgium/Germany) are prime beneficiaries of this transmission\ncapital spending, along with equipment providers such as ABB (Switzerland).\nIn addition, many global utilities will be viewed as back‐door beneficiaries of the shale gas boom\nglobally given the substantial amount of capex required to build new or upgrade existing infra‐structure.\nUS utilities are building much of the infrastructure to export gas out of the shale basins (Dominion,\nNiSource) and are building LNG liquefaction facilities (Dominion, Sempra) that are at the front of the\nqueue for US Department of Energy approval. Several European utilities, such as GDF Suez\n(Belgium/France) and Gas Natural (Spain), and Asian utilities such as Kunlun Energy and ENN Energy\n(China; note that China has 2x the shale gas reserves of the US) are exposed to LNG infrastructure\nspending.\nFinally, because of emerging markets’ growth rates and a higher intensity of energy use, emerging market\nutilities will benefit from infrastructure spending across the entire utility value chain.\n5. Substantial Alpha Opportunities Follow Periods of Underperformance\nThe global utility sector has experienced record underperformance and often this precedes substantial\nalpha opportunities.\n�\nRecord Duration and Depth of Underperformance\nWe have analyzed the price performance of the global utility sector since 1995, when MSCI introduced its\nGlobal Sectors. Although the period includes only 18 years of data, this is the relevant time frame as it\neffectively covers the entire period of industry deregulation (see Appendix 2, page 25).\nAs can be seen below, the current period of global utility underperformance is the deepest (‐67%) and\nlongest (4 years) of the modern utility era. Even with the strong rally in equity markets since the financial\ncrisis, the global utility sector is still down ‐11% on an absolute basis. It has not only been the worstperforming\nMSCI global sector but has also underperformed the second‐worst global sector by ‐23%.\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n14\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nSource: Bloomberg\nPrice\nMSCI Global Sectors\n1/1/2009 12/31/2012 Performance\nConsumer Discretionary 68.5 132.4 93%\nInformation Technology 54.2 96.9 79%\nMaterials 146.1 237.2 62%\nIndustrial 101.4 155.8 54%\nConsumer Staples 104.7 160.5 53%\nHealth Care 89.1 128.4 44%\nEnergy 181.9 238.9 31%\nFinancials 63.0 82.0 30%\nTelecom 51.0 56.9 12%\nUtilities 113.4 100.9 ‐11%\nSource: Bloomberg\n�\nReasons for Underperformance\nMuch of this recent underperformance can be explained by investors’ textbook preference, coming out of\nrecession, to add high‐beta stocks and shed low‐growth utilities. This was exacerbated by:\no soft power demand growth (particularly in Europe);\no generation overcapacity;\no delays in capital spending;\no lower commodity prices (particularly as a result of US shale gas production);\no central banks’ quantitative easing;\no political interference (notably in Europe);\no high debt loads;\no the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan; and\no concerns about interest rate rises from today’s very low levels.\nIt is hard to imagine a more perfect storm for the global utility sector than that which has played out\nover the past 4 years.\n�\nPotential Exists for Sharp Outperformance\nGlobally or regionally, it is not unusual to find long and/or sharp periods of utility underperformance (as\nwith the current record period). During such periods, when combined with wholesale shorts and market\nunderweighting, the sector becomes poised for extended outperformance rallies. This results from\nfundamental investors (both long/short and long‐only) rotating into the sector en masse, bidding up the\nbest value and growth utilities and underweighting or shorting utilities with poor business\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n15\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nmodels/prospects. This can be triggered by improving sector fundamentals, better data points, or\nconversely by events that instead lower investors’ perception of economic growth prospects (e.g., policy\nerrors, rising European sovereign yields, higher commodity prices, etc.).\nAs noted above (page 5), each time the sector’s underweighting reaches 1 standard deviation below the\nmean, over the next 24 months global utilities rise by 38% on an absolute basis and outperform the global\nbroad market by 20%, on average (see graph below).\nCumulative\noutperformance\nSource: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Bloomberg\nWhen these outperformance rallies occur, the potential massive alpha opportunity can be substantially\ngreater than the return from a fund’s net position.\nAs examples, we highlight the lessons from the dotcom period (second only to today’s record\nunderperformance) and lessons from Japan (given the deleveraging environment of today).\no\nPost‐Dotcom Rallies\nThe last time we saw underperformance anywhere close to today’s magnitude was during the 3‐\nyear run‐up to the dotcom bust (see graph below) as investors grabbed for growth in the “new\neconomy”. During the run‐up (Jan 97‐Jan 00), tech and telecom were the best‐performing sectors,\n+322% and +162%, respectively. The global utilities sector was the second‐worst‐performing global\nsector, +12% and in line with the +9% worst‐performing materials sector.\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n16\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nSource: Bloomberg\nOf course, not all investors sold utilities – some were astute buyers. Warren Buffett (at the time,\nthought to be a bit out of touch with the new economy) acquired $12 billion worth of utility assets\nbetween 1999 and 2002, namely MidAmerican ($9 billion), Kern River Gas Transmission ($960 million)\nand Northern Natural Gas ($1.9 billion).\nFollowing the dotcom bust (Mar 00‐Sep 01), global utilities staged a sharp catch‐up rally over a 1.5‐\nyear period, generating +33% outperformance (‐5% absolute). During this period, US utilities (which\npreviously were the worst‐performing region for utilities during the run‐up) outperformed +68%\n(+37% absolute). But the averages conceal some outsized moves in utility stocks as investors\nreturned to the sector en masse. Early investors realized enormous absolute returns on low‐beta US\nutility stocks (e.g. SO +114%, ETR +114%, FE +99%, AEP +91%, PEG +78%) while the S&P sank ‐31%.\nStill, investors were discriminating as several stocks (e.g., CVA ‐45%, AES ‐34%, EIX ‐19%, PCG ‐16%,\nNU ‐3%) suffered absolute declines.\nIn Europe, the UK water utility stocks (among the lowest‐beta/volatility stocks in the global sector)\nwere wholly ignored during the dotcom rally despite their improving fundamentals. Following the\ndotcom bust (Mar 00‐Sep 01) they also staged a fierce outperformance rally, and early fundamental\ninvestors realized very attractive absolute returns (e.g. Pennon +80%, Severn Trent +52% and United\nUtilities +21%), and enormous outperformance of the broader market (FTSE 100 Index ‐33%). This is\nall the more impressive when you consider that these water utility stocks have betas of\napproximately .43, less than half that of the broad market.\nAgain, fundamental investors were discerning as several European utilities experienced absolute\ndeclined during this same period (e.g., EDP ‐31%, Enel ‐30%, Endesa ‐20%, Centrica ‐19%).\no\nJapan Rallies\nJapan offers insights into potential utility outperformance during periods of private sector\ndeleveraging similar to what developed markets have experienced since the financial crisis.\nRichard Koo, Chief Economist of the Nomura Research Institute, cites two major policy errors that\nextended Japan’s long balance sheet recession: increased taxes in 1997 and expenditure cuts in 2001.\nBoth policy errors were preceded by a long or sharp period of utility underperformance relative to\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n17\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nthe broader market. Following the policy errors, Japanese utilities staged exceptionally strong\noutperformance rallies lasting over 1.5 years, on average, and outperforming the Topix by 30‐40%\n(graph below).\nSource: Nomura Research Institute, Bloomberg\nDuring the Jan 97–Nov 98 policy error period, fundamental investors bid up the better prospects\n(Tokyo Electric Power and Osaka Gas each rose 34%) while the Topix declined by ‐19. During this\nsame period, some Japanese utilities also posted sharp absolute declines, such as Hokkaido Gas ‐49%,\nSaibu Gas ‐30% and Okinawa Electric ‐27%. During the May 01‐May 03 policy error period, Okinawa\nElectric and Hokkaido Gas rallied +40% and +23%, respectively, while the Topix declined ‐44% and\nTokyo Electric Power and Osaka Gas declined ‐13% and ‐7%, respectively.\nThe Japanese utility experience is very interesting as several economists question whether the US is\ncurrently committing similar policy errors while deleveraging is still occurring in the private sector\n(e.g. the US just increased income and payroll taxes and is implementing austerity measures). The\nJapanese experience demonstrates the potential for strong outperformance rallies during periods of\ndeleveraging, demonstrating the alpha opportunity arising from an influx of fundamental investors\ninto the sector after periods of limited interest.\no\nPotential for Yield Catch‐up\nUnlike other income‐oriented investments such as Treasuries, German bunds, UK gilts, investmentgrade\nbonds, high‐yield bonds, emerging market bonds and MLPs, all of which have rallied strongly –\nsome believe as the result of a yield bubble – the global utility sector has been left behind; yet\ncertain parts offer a compelling investment yield opportunity today. If some fixed income cross‐over\ninvestors become more concerned about inflation (because of economic growth), yet continue to be\nsqueezed by the QE programs of the Fed, BOE, BOJ, etc., then they could begin shifting into global\nutilities. This seems logical, as such investors would look for the closest bond proxies in the equity\nmarket, the utility sector, rather than bypass utilities for high‐beta broad market stocks. Given the\nenormous amounts of capital controlled by fixed income cross‐over investors, even a small\nreweighting could have a significant effect in bidding utility stock prices up and yields down.\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n18\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\n6. Interest Rate Risk – A Common Misperception\nWe find a common misperception among investors to be the degree of interest rate risk in the global utility\nsector, as interest rate sensitivity has declined steadily since the modern utility industry came into being in\nthe early 1990s.\nThere is a relatively higher degree of interest rate risk in the defensive, fully‐regulated utilities given their\nbond‐like returns and the capital‐intensive nature of the industry, which demands heavy use of debt financing.\nSuch defensive fully‐regulated utilities can be found in all regions, however the highest concentration is found\nin the US. European, Asian and Latam utilities are more levered to economic growth and therefore tend to be\nno more interest rate‐sensitive than broad market equities.\nEven the performance of the more interest rate‐sensitive US utilities is not fully determined by interest rates.\nFor example, during the market rally from fall 2002 to summer 2007, the US utility sector generated a nonbeta‐adjusted\nannualized total return 5.2% higher (2.8% from better price appreciation and 2.4% from\ndividend reinvestment) than the S&P 500, while the 10‐year Treasury yield rose from 3.6% to 4.9% (+130 bps)\nover this period. Valuation re‐rating and earnings growth from generators, as economic growth tightened\npower markets and raised commodity prices, outweighed the negative impact of rising interest rates.\nWe would note furthermore that yield relationships have moved to unprecedented extremes such that, for\nexample, the dividend yield for US regulated utilities versus the 10‐year Treasury yield currently sits at 7\nstandard deviations above the mean from the historical pre‐2008 environment (see graph below). An even\nmore dramatic relationship exists for the European utilities. This suggests that policy rates are at such levels\nthat there is substantial cushion against rising rates.\nSource: Bloomberg\nFinally, we track interest rate risk in the Electron risk model for all positions. We are not looking to make\nmacro calls, and the portfolio’s net interest rate risk is kept within acceptable limits as we select stocks in the\nglobal utility sector. This process has worked well for us as over 7 years we have posted strong returns and\nalpha generation in both rising and falling interest rate environments. As a result, many investors are\npleasantly surprised to learn that despite perceptions of the global utility sector’s interest rate sensitivity,\nElectron’s return correlation to interest rates is slightly lower than the HFRI Equity Hedge Index’s return\ncorrelation to interest rates.\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n19\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nAppendix 1: The Team and Our Process\n�\nElectron Focus\nElectron’s universe of utility and infrastructure stocks is deep, comprising 375 companies with a market\ncap of $2.8 trillion. Stocks covered include the electric, gas, water and waste utilities in addition to\ninfrastructure companies (defined as those levered to utilities or utility‐like). Our approach is truly global\nas 40‐60% of the portfolio’s historical gross has been allocated outside the US.\n�\nElectron Team\nElectron’s cohesive, long‐standing team consists of 8 members, including 5 investment professionals who\nhave worked (with Jos Shaver as Portfolio Manager) at SAC Capital and the original Electron Capital for an\naverage of 6 years. In addition, 4 of the 5 investment professionals have lived outside the US, a distinct\ncompetitive advantage given our global approach. Each investment professional brings his/her own\nspecific expertise and diligent research to our process, working collaboratively across regions to conduct\ndeep‐dive research on the most compelling opportunities in the global utility sector.\nThe other members of Electron complement the skills and experience of the investment team. Electron’s\nexperienced operations/investor relations professionals are former Intrepid Capital employees who\nworked with the Electron team during the first iteration of Electron (2005–2008) when the firm had a\nservices agreement with Intrepid Capital.\nFinally, a Senior Advisory Board consisting of former C‐level utility executives from around the globe has\nbeen with the team since the launch of the original Electron Capital in 2005, and all have rejoined for\nElectron’s re‐launch.\nAs Portfolio Manager, Jos Shaver has covered the global utility and infrastructure sectors for the past 21\nyears, and his sector perspective benefits from his having lived 10 years abroad (5 years in Asia covering\nthe Asian utilities and 5 years in Europe covering European utilities) and 11 years in the US. In addition, as\nManaging Partner, Jos controls all major decisions at Electron.\n�\nTrack Record (7 years)\nElectron’s 7‐year track record (3 years audited from the original Electron and 4 years from SAC Capital)\nhas annualized 10.3% since inception and has been characterized by strong alpha generation on both the\nlong and short side (80% of returns, based on Jensen’s alpha calculation). Electron generated this 7‐year\ntrack record during an exceptionally challenging period for global utilities – the MSCI World Utility Index\nhas been the worst‐performing MSCI Global Sector ex‐financials over the track record period, down ‐0.2%.\nNotwithstanding, Electron’s track record has bested the MSCI World Utility, S&P 500 and HFRI indices by\n91%, 67% and 61%, respectively.\n�\nProcess\nFirst, given Electron’s global approach to utility research, we tend to have a clear competitive advantage\nwith respect to early recognition of cross‐border structural change (e.g., how a change in Asian seaborne\ncoal market might affect off‐peak power prices and thus earnings for a Midwest US utility). Moreover,\nour global research approach allows us to gain perspective on structural change outcomes given our\nknowledge of global precedents and the likely reaction from various interested parties (e.g., governments,\nregulators, managements, customers, consumer groups, rating agencies, shareholders, debt holders, et\nal.) We analyze other global precedents, develop a thesis and then conduct deep‐dive research to gain\nconviction. Once we have developed a structural change thesis, we proceed to a full bottoms‐up analysis\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n20\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nof the earnings impact for the relevant companies, and assess what might be priced in by thoroughly\nreviewing the Street’s numbers and commentary. It should also be noted that the same structural event\noften affects not one but several companies, and the implementation of these structural changes are\ntypically not one‐day events. As such, depending on the situation, we may have the opportunity to\ncapitalize on the same structural change event several times as it develops.\nOur research process is our primary idea generator. We travel extensively and, collectively, the 5\ninvestment professionals will have between 600 and close to 1,000 meetings a year as we speak with\ncompanies, regulators, consultants, sell‐side analysts and governments.\no\nWhy We Take a Global Approach ‐ The “Greatest Gift”\nElectron takes a global approach (historically, 40‐60% of gross allocated outside the US) to the\nutility sector: i) to spot structural change and resultant inefficiencies early, ii) to provide a wider\ncanvas to allocate capital around the globe to the most attractive (from a risk/reward point of view)\nalpha opportunities and, most importantly, iii) to enable the Electron Global Funds to take advantage\nof the global sector’s very low inter‐regional correlation (i.e., correlation of regions within the global\nsector; lowest of all MSCI global sectors – see below).\nOne of the least\ncorrelated sectors\nSource: MSCI, 7 years’ weekly trailing correlation\nWe call this very low regional correlation the global utility sector’s greatest gift to long/short\ninvestors as it provides a greater return per unit of risk if one has the ability to dynamically allocate\ncapital to and generate alpha in all regions. There are few long/short global utility funds today given\nthe global utility experience required to capture the greatest gift, as different countries have different\nutility market designs and structures.\nThe Electron process starts with a focus on structural change and we embrace the myriad of utility\nmarkets’ differences around the globe because this approach leads to the most attractive alpha\nopportunities and the benefits of the “greatest gift”. We allocate capital dynamically to the most\nattractive alpha opportunities in the global utility industry. As a result, the Electron Global Funds is\nonly one fund, yet the “greatest gift” provides the diversification benefit of 4 relatively uncorrelated\nregions and concentration in the globe’s most attractive alpha opportunities.\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n21\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\no\nCapitalizing on Structural Change Timing\nAlthough some of the structural changes discussed earlier happen in days or weeks, e.g. fuel cost\npassthrough adjustments, others will take years to implement, for example, new capacity payment\nstructures. Because of the sector’s high earnings visibility, however, we do not have to wait until a\nparticular structural change occurs for a thesis to play out. Utilities often have earnings visibility 2‐3\nyears out (including Street estimates) which is in contrast to other sectors (e.g. tech) which often\ntimes do not have 2‐3 quarters of visibility. As such, utility stock prices (and the Street’s estimates)\nwill begin to discount even some of the longer dated structural changes as clarity surfaces in the early\nstages. Therefore, there is a distinct competitive advantage for those who have an early\nunderstanding of such structural changes and the resulting earnings impact on affected utilities. We\ntherefore focus our efforts on discerning the structural change opportunity early in an effort to come\nup with a view before it becomes obvious to the broader market.\nMoreover, there are often several opportunities over an extended time period to trade the same\nstructural change as numerous stakeholders (e.g. government, regulator, company, customers, et al.)\ninvolved in the process distort market perceptions of the final outcome.\nAlthough structural changes are the “home run” opportunities, Electron returns are not limited to\nsuch changes, as we also consistently play for “singles and doubles” in the global utility sector with\nearning releases, regulatory reviews, dividend increases and decreases, relative value, regulatory\narbitrage, etc.\nAs evidence of Electron’s ability to successfully trade both shorter‐ and longer‐term structural\nchanges, please note our sweet spot for generating returns over the 7‐year track record has tended\nto be 45‐90 days.\n�\nPortfolio Construction\nTypically, the portfolio has 70‐100 positions, but concentration is very important to generating returns.\nHistorically, the top 10 longs represent 40‐50% of the Fund’s value, and top 10 shorts represent 30‐40% of\nthe fund’s value. Typically we will have a 10% position in the portfolio; this is invariably a liquid, big‐cap\nutility name with limited downside and a good degree of upside which is expected to be favorably\naffected by a key, underappreciated structural change.\nThe stronger the conviction (from a risk/reward point of view) in the alpha opportunity, the higher the\ngross we run. This flexibility in portfolio construction (which we successfully proved over 3 years during\nthe first iteration of Electron) provides a distinct advantage given the utility sector’s many low‐beta, lowvolatility\nstocks. During the original Electron Capital period, gross ranged from 150% to 215% and a\nmedian of 185% over the period. We see maintaining a similar operating range for gross for the re‐launch\nfor Electron.\nRegarding nets, we will always have a properly hedged product as there are always opportunities on the\nshort side to generate alpha. Over our 7‐year track record period, the net averaged 22% net long. During\nthe first 3 years of Electron, our net averaged 30% long. Given our bearish view on utilities over the last 4\nyears, the net averaged 17% net long.\n�\nRisk Model and Risk Management\nWe view utilities as distinct bundles of risk. Just as we are staunch supporters of sum‐of‐the‐parts (SOTP)\nvaluation, we are also believers in SOTP risk monitoring. As such, our risk model developed over the last\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n22\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\n8 years tracks approximately 60 industry, commodity, and financial risk metrics and is a focus for the\nElectron team. For example, consider oil price risk; although there may be no direct oil exposure in the\nportfolio, there is indirect oil exposure if we were to be short Drax, a coal‐fired generator that sells power\ninto the UK power market. In the UK, natural gas sets the marginal price of power, and in Europe, by\nconvention, natural gas is linked to the oil price; as such, a short position in Drax represents an effective\nshort position in oil. We track this risk along with numerous other factors that affect utilities, with the\npurpose of minimizing risks for which we have no competitive advantage that would justify taking on the\nexposure. We describe the risk model in more detail in the marketing book. In addition, we make the\nElectron risk model available for all prospective investors’ due diligence.\nEach position in the risk model contains a thesis write‐up (to avoid thesis creep); upside, downside and\nrelative targets (for valuation discipline); and a time frame (to avoid collecting stocks). In addition to\ntracking numerous industry, financial and macro risks, we also track alpha generation for all of our\nregions, sectors, subsectors and sub‐subsectors, which provides the added benefit of a granular window\non market flows. Finally, we incorporate an exponential function into the risk model that provides an\nearly alert and focuses our attention when something is not working. For example, we might be short\nXYZ utility with 30% downside potential over 3 months, and put in a 15% loss limit. If in the first week XYZ\nruns up 5%, it will trigger a “FAST” move alert in the risk model. If we cannot explain why the position is\nmoving against us, we will cover (i.e., when in doubt, get out). As mentioned, this is not a crowded space\n(rarely do utility names appear on the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP list) and many names are low‐beta,\nlow‐volatility stocks. However, often when money is lost on the short side, it is the result of small daily\nlosses that would not be noticeable on any given day, but over even short periods of time can add up to\nsizeable losses.\n�\nShorting Global Utilities\no\nExperience with Dividends and Investor Behavior\nDuring the underperformance of the global utility industry over the last 4 years, Electron generated\nvery strong alpha on the short side. We spend almost twice as much time on the short side as we do\nthe long side; this is driven not only by the need for more short positions (given the asymmetry of\nrisk) but also because of the effect of utility dividends on investor behavior. For example, we might\nbe short a large cap utility with a 4% dividend yield that we believe to be a structural loser. The stock\nmight decline 25%, which would push the dividend yield up to 5.5%. Even though our valuation\nmodels might tell us there is still another 10‐15% valuation downside, we will tend to cover (unless\nwe believe the dividend is materially at risk), as the dividend yield will begin to provide support for\nthe stock. The precise level of the dividend yield at which we would cover is as much an art as a\nscience, as it is based on our experience in a variety of situations and our views on investor behavior\n(particularly income funds) gained over many years of covering the sector. As such, you will find us\ntrading around our short positions more frequently than our long positions.\no\nKey to Electron’s Process to Identify Dividend Change Candidates\nWe also have developed a certain expertise in being early and correctly calling dividend changes – an\nevent that can have a dramatic impact on the performance of utilities given the make‐up of the\ninvestor base. In our long experience, utility CEO/CFOs will strongly defend the company’s dividend\n(often borrowing or selling assets to fund it). As such, when they do finally cut the dividend, or talk\nabout the possibility, they often surprise the market.\nIt pays to be diligent in assessing the potential for a dividend cut, and to be early, since once\nCEO/CFOs accept that their business model is deteriorating, they will quickly take action, especially if\ntheir companies have less flexibility (particularly with respect to cutting capex and opex). Large‐cap\nutility managements desire strong credit ratings and are reluctant to risk an investment grade rating.\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n23\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nThey are in a capital‐intensive business and need to preserve deep, low‐cost access to both the equity\nand debt capital markets. Moreover, collateral requirements for forward power price hedging\ntypically will spike if a utility loses its investment grade rating, which can spur concern about liquidity.\nBuilding conviction around a dividend cut thesis requires more than screening. Our process focuses\non researching capex flexibility, cost‐cutting potential and asset divestiture potential to determine\nthe flexibility a company has under various scenarios. Our research process breaks capex into 3\nbuckets: i) committed capex (e.g. required by the regulator), ii) nondiscretionary capex (e.g. major\nplant overhauls – CEOs tend to avoid delays so as not to jeopardize billion dollar‐plus assets), and iii)\ndiscretionary capex (CEOs can delay but may jeopardize future growth).\nRegarding opex, we look for cost‐cutting capability, which we estimate by breaking apart the opex\nline or by global benchmarking. Finally, we estimate the potential impact from possible asset\ndivestitures and the resulting impact on earnings and leverage. Once we have completed the\nresearch work on capex, opex and potential divestitures, we model various sensitivities from\nstructural changes or other key drivers that might cause a deterioration or improvement in a utility\ncompany’s business model against forward‐looking credit rating agency (S&P, Moody’s, etc.) ratios.\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n24\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nAppendix 2: Global Utility Sector Background\n�\nHistory\nTo gain a deeper appreciation of why the global utility sector is attractive for long/short investing, it is\nhelpful to briefly survey the history of the sector and describe the utility value chain’s components.\nThe utility industry as we know it began in 1882 when Thomas Edison built the world’s first generating\nstation on Pearl Street in downtown Manhattan. In the early decades the industry evolved along multiple\nlines but eventually settled into an integrated, fully‐regulated model, deemed appropriate as utilities\nwere considered to have monopoly power. During the era of full regulation, utility stocks were often\ncharacterized as low‐risk “widow and orphan” stocks in the US, and large parts of the global utility\nindustry remained government‐owned. During these early days, long/short investing could not have\nexisted at scale, as the ability to find and generate short alpha would have been difficult given the sector’s\ngovernment ownership and bond‐like nature of returns.\nIn the 1980s, Lord David Howell (formerly UK Secretary of State for Energy in the Thatcher government)\nadvocated having then‐fully regulated power plants compete to sell their production into a competitive\npower market (a “power pool”) where the price of electricity would be set at the intersection of supply\n(power plants) and demand (industrial users and electricity supply companies selling to households). This\nled to the world’s first competitive power pools being rolled out in the UK in the early 1990s. While\nbased in Asia, Jos Shaver led UBS’ Asian utility industry group and had the privilege of working with Lord\nHowell when UBS acted as advisor to the State Power Corporation of China on the restructuring of that\ncountry’s national power industry.\nCompetitive power pools have since sprung up all over the world, and regulators have pulled apart\npreviously fully‐integrated utilities in the name of efficiency and maximizing competition. In addition,\ngovernments around the world have begun to privatize their state utility industries and organize bespoke\ncompetitive market structures that best meet their needs. These changes have resulted in a hybrid\nmodern industry which continues to evolve.\nThe deregulatory impulse has brought tremendous benefits to national economies, driving down costs\nand improving efficiency and system reliability, but has also produced unintended consequences, e.g., the\nhigh‐profile bankruptcies of Enron, British Energy, Dynegy, NRG, PG&E and others. As such, although one\ncan still find low‐beta, low‐volatility defensive stocks, the global utility sector has not been for “widow\nand orphan” investors for quite some time due to structural changes in an evolving industry that\ncontinue to alter the investment landscape.\nIt is important to note that the modern utility industry is still in its infancy, having begun in the early\n1990s, and its continued evolution – structural change – will provide ample long/short opportunities for\nthe foreseeable future. Structural change catalysts are driven by: i) a utility’s various stakeholders,\nincluding governments, managements, consumers, et al. which seek to mold the utility to their needs and\nobjectives, or ii) variables outside of stakeholder control such as commodity prices and new technologies.\nA specialist approach to the global utility sector is essential as each country’s market structure (and often\nthat of regions within countries) can be very different as a result of the varying levels of competition,\nmarket concentration, geographic constraints, infrastructure bottlenecks, regulatory constructs, fuel\nsupply availability and so on.\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n25\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\n�\nUtility Value Chain\nThe electricity value chain for a modern day fully integrated utility consists of Generation + Transmission\n+ Distribution + Customers (see diagram below). Each segment of the value chain is a different business,\nwith distinct risks and economic drivers. Competition has surfaced in each part of the value chain other\nthan transmission and distribution (which are fully‐regulated assets as they are deemed to be natural\nmonopolies). Still, regulators have learned to bring indirect competition even to monopoly‐regulated\nbusinesses by encouraging returns based on efficiency improvements or benchmarking to comparable\ncompanies.\nSource: US Department of Energy\nFor exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein\n26\nElectron Capital Partners, LLC\nGlobal Utility White Paper\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDisclaimer\nThis report, which is attached as an exhibit to the Investor Presentation, is presented by Electron Capital Partners\nLLC (“Electron”) solely for information purposes to provide recipients with general information regarding Electron’s\ncurrent view of the global utility sector.
