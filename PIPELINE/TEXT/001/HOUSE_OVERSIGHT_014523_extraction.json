With a repeal likely to happen well before a replace \n(essentially via the Budget Reconciliation process in Jan/Feb), Andy notes this is likely to include a repeal of both \nhealth insurance exchange subsidies & a phase-down of Medicaid expansion funding (albeit with a two or three year \ntransition period). \nHe also expects a repeal of many of the larger HC related taxes in the ACA, including the HIX ($14.3bn in 2018), \nMedtech Tax (2.3%), pharma industry tax ($4.1bn in 2018) & Cadillac tax (effective 2020). \nAs for the views by analysts...  \nBiotech (+) — believe sector will outperform largely as pricing risk has diminished (although will remain in pockets) but \npipelines/growth remains. Ying's top picks are CELG & REGN; Tazeen's top picks are kCAD & RARE. \nSpec Pharma (-) — headwinds remain w/ Sumant's top pick AGN given lower risk to reimbursement pressures & an \nunderappreciated pipeline. Leverage & CF remain the key focus for investors. \nTools/Animal Health (=) — Derik notes more \"headline\" than \"real\" risks from policy which will create opportunities for a \ngroup growing MSD, although valuations remain above peers. (US 1 name) top pick, also A, ZTS in Animal \nHealth, in Diagnostics & in Services. \nMedtech (=) — Hopkins' expects a mixed bag in 2017 w/ stocks trading close to 5yr valuation lows; EW top pick given \nbest growth / purest innovation story. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014523 \nFacilities (-) — Fischbeck notes that uncertainty will remain an overhang for hospitals as repeal/replace a negative for \nthe group (est losing 2-3mm Medicaid lives & 2-3mm exchange lives would be a 1-2% EBITDA hit on avg). Focus on \ncompany-specific stories like \nMCOs (+) — Fischbeck generally +ve under Trump (especially around MA given historical support from GOP) w/ \ntailwinds from corporate tax & rising rates. top pick in given valuation & tailwinds. \nDistribution/Tech (=) — Valiquette prefers pharmacies ,,,'VS/WBA given benefits from decelerating generic prices \n(which will remain an overhang for Distributors).
