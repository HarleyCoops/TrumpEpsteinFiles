He is consumed by the \nresponsibilities of selecting new Cabinet members and \npreparing strategies to get them confirmed. He already \nhad his fair share of critics, and the last thing he needs \nis a music critic telling him how to run the country. \nSo I'm sorry to have to be the one to remind you, Mr. \nPresident, that you've left someone out. Secretary of \nCulture. It's time. \nDespite a troubling international reduction of \ngovernment support for the arts thanks to the world \neconomic crises, most countries still manage to \nmaintain ministries of culture, and not just seats of \nWestern civilization such as France, Italy, Spain, Great Britain and Greece but also in Albania, Brazil, \nHaiti, Ethiopia, Cambodia and about 50 other countries. We, instead, have the National Endowment \nfor the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. \nadvertiserneirt \nRICHARD JACKSON \nAin't Painting a Pain \nFe \nORANGE COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART \nPHOTOS: Arts and culture in pictures by The Times  \nI'm a great supporter of these institutions, but I'm calling for their removal and the creation of a new \nCabinet-level agency for culture. The NEA, to which I've been closest in my career, is a wonderful \norganization, doing what it can to support institutions (if no longer individual artists) large and small. \nBut it is also a political football and it is always going to be one. \nOne of the calls to abolish the NEA, for instance, came from Mitt Romney in last year's campaign, as \npart of his proposal to balance the budget But during the debates Obama failed to note that \ninvestment in the arts is a more reliable jobs creator than in nearly all industries, nor is it easily \noutsourced. That has been an idee fixe of the Obama-appointed outgoing NEA head, Rocco \nhttp://www.latimes.cornientertainmentiarts/culture/la-et-cm-secretary-of-culture-notebook-... 3/27/2013 \n\fThe case for naming a U.S. secretary of Culture - latimes.com Page 2 of 3 \nLandesman. Even so, Landesman's budget got slashed 13% for fiscal 2012 to an embarrassing $146 \nmillion. \nAs arts supporters love to point out, that is less than half of the budget the Pentagon provides for \nmilitary bands alone. In cash-strapped France, on the other hand, Minister of Culture and \nCommunication Aurelie Filippetti was enraged when President Francois Hollande cut the 2013 budget \nof her department 4.3% to 7.363 billion euros, which is just under $10 billion. According to \nLandesman, the U.S. remains the weakest funder of arts in the developed world. \nFrom the start, Obama had seemed a good prospect for becoming an arts president, and four years \nago, as he was about to assume office, 76,000 people signed a petition, instigated by Quincy Jones, \nbegging the new president to create a Cabinet-level cultural ministry patterned after France's. He has \nstepped out to arts events and invited artists from many genres to the White House. But he's kept that \npretty low profile. The arts can be a lightning rod among populist politicians, and Washington is \ndivided enough as it is. Clearly Obama has had other preoccupations than cabinetizing culture. But \nthat divisiveness is precisely why we need a Cabinet-level spokesperson for culture. We have come to \nsee ourselves as a country of opposites. The allocation of public funds for just about anything is \nviewed as a war between the rich and the poor. We color our states red or blue. Some of us love guns; \nsome of us hate them. Go down the line, and there appears to be less and less on which we agree. \nOne thing we do have in common is our identity. Wherever we are on whatever spectrum, we see \nourselves as Americans. It is that culture that makes everything else matter. The arts and the \nhumanities help us figure out who we are. \nA Department of Culture, into which the current NEA and NEH might be folded, may not be \nprotected from budgetary vulnerability, but it would at least have more prestige and perhaps more \nstability. It would also empower a public spokesperson for culture. \nMaybe even more essential is the influence a secretary of Culture could have in a way-too-wonky \nWashington. I know there aren't regular Cabinet meetings anymore where all the secretaries gather \naround a big table and hash out all the issues of the country. Imagine, though, a perfect White House, \nwhere Cabinet officials did often collect, and among them sat a political outsider, a generalist who \ncould offer rich historical insight from the humanities and visionary thinking from the arts. \nPHOTOS: Arts and culture in pictures by The Times \nIdeally, a secretary of Culture should be a political outsider, able to function as a moral conscience for \nall decision making. He or she would further serve as someone able to ask the hard questions, to see \nthe world from possibly unexpected angles and help prompt new solutions to old problems. As artists \nknow and politicians refuse to acknowledge, all you have to do to create change is change your mind. \nSo whom could we get? Who could speak in such a way that the right and left would listen? Who \nfrom the arts or the humanities could possibly win the respect of expert wonks? Who could inspire a \ndivided nation? \nI've saved my suggestions for last because you're going to think them outlandish. They're not. \nFirst, I nominate Peter Sellars. Stop laughing How is an L.A.-based theater, opera and festival \ndirector who sports spiky hair, strings his own beads, buys his clothes at thrift shops and regularly \nhttp://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-secretary-of-culture-notebook-... 3/27/2013 \n\fThe case for naming a U.S. secretary of Culture - latimes.com Page 3 of 3 \ncourts controversy ever going to become a national spokesperson, to say nothing of a Washington \nofficial? \nSellars, however, happens to be one of the most persuasive and inspirational public figures we have. \nHe exhibits a bottomless empathy and spirituality with broad reach. Yes, some of his productions \nhave been left-leaning, but he can, one on one, reach just about everyone. He is politically motivated \nand sophisticated. He thinks profoundly about social issues. \nHe also has a way with politicians. A few years ago he was asked to speak at the World Economic \nForum in Davos, Switzerland, about nuclear proliferation — something he became highly \nknowledgeable about when he and composer John Adams put on \"Doctor Atomic,\" an opera about the \ncreation of the atomic bomb. Sellars held heads of state in awe. \nMy second nomination is Leon Botstein, president of Bard College in New York state. He is one of \nour few remaining public intellectuals and a renaissance man, which means he is a conductor, \neducator and scholar. He too is unusually persuasive when speaking on any number of issues to any \nkind of audience. \nYes, he's also a liberal, one who as a young man could hold his brilliant own against William F. \nBuckley on \"Firing Line.\" But he is just as brilliant an administrator who, in his nearly 40-year tenure \nat Bard, has made the school into one of the most progressive and prominent humanities colleges in \nthe country by appealing to donors on all sides of the political spectrum. He's an egghead who goes on \n\"The Colbert Report.\" \nBotstein makes things happen, and he makes them happen by persuading people to look beyond their \npreconceptions, to view society in broad and grand terms. He is someone politicians and the people \ncould listen to. \nSo what is the likelihood that Obama will announce on the steps of the Capitol on Monday that over \nthese next four years he wants to make the arts a national priority and for that reason he is now \nnominating Sellars or Botstein to the newly created post of secretary of Culture? Zero. He's not crazy. \nStill, if Albania can have one, why can't we? \nmarkswed(C)jaames.corn \nMORE \nINTERACTIVE: Christopher Depictions of violence in \nHawthorne's On the Boulevardstheater and more \nCopyright 2013, Los Angeles Times \nhttp://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-secretary-of-culture-notebook-... 3/27/2013 \nPHOTOS: Arts and culture in \npictures \n"
