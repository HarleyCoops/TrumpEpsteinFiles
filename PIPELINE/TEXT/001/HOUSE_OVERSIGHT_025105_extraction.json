Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More \nimportantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in \nrelated encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the \"Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams\" (2012) and \nthe sole author of the forthcoming \"An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams\" (Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for \ngraduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. \nWhen we asked Patrick, his first response — \"This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story\" — and he \ncited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well \ncorroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper \nunderstanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and \nestablished, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and \npursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes \n(e.g., PTSD and Depression). \nTo understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that \nthere are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye-\nmovement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement \ngives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves \n(electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is \nSlow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has \nbeen known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and \nconfirmed in very recent years (as explained below). \nFollowing are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are \nnow reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the \npublic - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams \nessential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. \nMemory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory \nconsolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. \nHence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many \nneuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025106 \nAnxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and \nDepression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. \nThis is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact \nthat REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of \ndreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with \nrational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated\" \n(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is \nwhy dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that \nthe limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and \ndreams can enhance creativity. \nAs Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: \"It would be nice if we could talk about sleep \nand memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. \nSleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of \npost-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.\" \nImmunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. \nDiscerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive \nthat sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that \ngoing unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various \nnon-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a \nstronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that \nfight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This \ngives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are \"genetic conflict\" studies \nwith respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and \ndifferences between males and females in which genes get \"imprinted\". \nNeuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new \nneurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a \nvital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in \nthe hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in \nthe hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why \nREM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). \nDream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only \nin very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and \nstatistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, \nincluding cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size \nand structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. \nPatterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. \nMales will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers \nare often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness \nby the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.) \n\"Lucid Dreaming\" is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer \"knows\" that \nhe/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be \ntrained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering \ntheir brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below). \nNeuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is \nitself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now \nenables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In \nREM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is \"down-regulated\", whereas the limbic system is \"up-regulated\", \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025107 \nshowing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will \nenable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.) \nPatrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding \nsleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the \"purpose\" of sleep and dreams, as well \nas engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses). \nAttached is Patrick's quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017, \nespecially 2015-2017). \nYou'd enjoy speaking with him, if you want. \nLove to do this series together with you. \nMuch appreciate and warm regards, \nRobert \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
