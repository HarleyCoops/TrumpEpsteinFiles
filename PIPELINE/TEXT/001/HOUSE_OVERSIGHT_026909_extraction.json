Numerous headlines of stock market “carnage” have further eroded\ntheir confidence. As a result, some of our clients have asked whether this drop signifies the beginning\nof the end of a nearly 10-year bull market.\nWe do not think so. So far, this pullback is actually smaller than the two prior downdrafts we\nexperienced in late January and in mid-March, neither of which derailed the US economy nor the bull\nmarket. The steady factors we highlighted in our annual Outlook—such as economic growth, benign\ninflation, robust earnings, and low probability of recession—have not dissipated. Furthermore, while\nthe investor focus has shifted to the risks around the unsteady undertow, most of these factors are,\non balance, less concerning today than they were at the beginning of 2018.\nOf course, that is not the case across all geopolitical concerns. While trade tensions with Mexico and\n1\nCanada have abated, those with China have certainly deteriorated and will continue to do so for the\nforeseeable future. But, in aggregate, there has been more improvement than deterioration, in our\nview.\nIn this Sunday Night Insight, we will provide a brief update on the steady factors and unsteady\nundertow. We then conclude with our view that the steady factors will likely continue to win this tug-ofwar\nbetween the two.\nSteady Factors\nWhile the headlines warn of equity market carnage, the facts do not support such alarming headlines.\nThe S&P 500 is still up 5.1% on a year-to-date total return basis and financial conditions remain at\neasier levels today than they did when the Federal Reserve began this tightening cycle in 2015,\ndespite the recent decline in equities and 0.76 percentage point increase in 10-year Treasury yields\nyear-to-date. Most importantly, as highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, we are\nin “extraordinary times” of steady growth and low inflation.\nEconomic Growth\nEconomic growth remains firm in the US. Both the Institute for Supply Management leading indexes\nfor manufacturing and non-manufacturing remain at very strong levels. Current activity indicators of\nreal GDP growth average about 3.5% for the third quarter and closer to 4% for the fourth quarter.\nForecasts for third quarter real GDP average 3.8% and fourth quarter forecasts are about 2.8%.\nWhile growth is slowing from the 4.2% estimate of the second quarter, it is still forecast to be above\ntrend and we believe a modest slowdown is certainly preferable to continued growth at a pace that\nwas likely unsustainable and possibly even inflationary.\nIn aggregate, the economic data since the intraday peak of US equities on September 21st does not\npoint to any worrisome slowdown in GDP growth or the pace of employment. In fact, while the recent\n134K increase in non-farm payrolls was less than expectations, revisions to earlier months offset the\nmodest headline miss and the unemployment rate still fell to 3.7%. Furthermore, this 134k increase\nis above the estimated sustainable level of employment growth based on population growth and\nchanges in labor force participation, which our colleagues in Goldman Investment Research estimate\nis around 96k. Importantly, a modest slowdown in the 3-month average of non-farm payrolls, which\ncurrently stands at a very robust 190k jobs, is more likely to keep inflation in check.\nRobust Earnings and Buybacks\nContinued above-trend economic growth is supporting solid corporate fundamentals. While many are\nquick to dismiss this strength to US tax reform, it is only half the story. Earnings before interest and\ntaxes (EBIT) expanded by a very healthy 12% in the first half of this year and are expected to grow by\ndouble-digits again in the third quarter. This robust organic profit growth is also fueling sizable\ncorporate buybacks—a key source of equity market support. Our colleagues on the corporate\nbuyback desk expect the highest dollar amount for buybacks on record in 2018, with $1tn in\nauthorizations and $850bn in executed buybacks.\n2\nTotal Return (%)\nEven so, such robust earnings growth has begun to foster concern that we have reached a peak in\nEPS growth. While we do expect the pace of growth to slow next year, a local peak in earnings\ngrowth has not signified an imminent peak in the S&P 500 historically. In fact, about 3/4ths of market\npeaks occurred more than two years after the peak in the growth rate of earnings. Moreover, stock\nmarket returns have remained healthy during this period, with high odds of a positive outcome over\nthe subsequent 6-24 months (see Exhibit 1). In short, the market ultimately follows the path of\nearnings and while their growth rate may be slowing, their absolute level is still rising.\n1.

In\nfact, some of the most recent data released in October have ticked slightly lower. Average hourly\nearnings dropped to 2.8% from the prior month’s level of 2.9%. Headline CPI dropped to 2.3% from\n2.7% and Core CPI ex-food and energy remain at a low 2.2%, unchanged from the prior month. The\nFederal Reserve’s preferred inflation indicator, Core PCE, also remains low at 2.0% which is in line\nwith the Federal Reserve’s target, and unchanged from the prior month.\nWhile 10-year Treasury yields have risen by 0.76% (or 76 basis points) over the course of 2018, we\ndo not think the resulting 3.2% yield is enough to derail US economic growth. Keep in mind that most\nof the recent increase since late August was due to stronger real growth rather than runaway inflation\nexpectations. We expect interest rates to range between 3.0% and 3.5% in 2019 with a midpoint of\n3.25%, barring any major geopolitical conflicts such as one between US and China and or escalating\nconflicts in the Middle East.\n3\nYoY %\n2.

Yet our work suggests there are several reasons why rates could continue to rise before\nbecoming a material headwind for stocks. First, the 4% trend growth rate of nominal US GDP—\nreflecting 2% real growth and 2% inflation—remains comfortably above the 10-year Treasury yield of\n4\nUS 10-Year Treasury Yield (%)\n3.2% (i.e. the cost of borrowing). Stocks typically struggle when the cost of borrowing exceeds the\nnominal growth of the economy (see Exhibit 4). Second, the recent backup in interest rates was\ndriven primarily by improving real growth expectations, not higher inflation. This distinction is critical,\nbecause higher rates in response to improving real growth tend to benefit earnings sufficiently to\novercome the downward pressure they place on valuation multiples. Finally, it will take a number of\nyears before higher rates meaningfully impact aggregate S&P 500 interest expense, considering 91%\nof S&P 500 debt is fixed-rate and only 13% matures over the next two years.\n4.

We believe that\nFederal Reserve Chairman Powell’s recent commentary indicates that the FOMC will continue\nto be driven by data and financial market conditions. Their stated goal is to extend this\nexpansion “indefinitely.” 1 While the Federal Reserve dots point towards four more interest rate\nhikes by the end of 2019, we do not think that such hikes materially increase the odds of a\nrecession in an economy that continues to grow at levels that are generally regarded as above\ntrend growth in the US.\nRecent steepening of the yield curve. We have highlighted two measures of the yield curve as\nsign-posts we watch as an early harbinger of a recession. Both have steepened since their\nlows, as shown in Exhibits 5 and 6.\n5\nSpread (%)\nSpread (%)\n5.

Potential US retaliation over the recent disappearance of a\nSaudi journalist has only added fuel to the fire of worries given the risk that oil exports could be used\nas a political weapon in a world with tighter oil supply thanks to impending US sanctions on Iran.\nAs we review the geopolitical developments of 2018, it is clear that some of the risks have abated\nwhile others have increased. With the exception of a significant spike in oil prices due to the impact of\nsanctions on Iran or any escalation in US-Saudi tensions, we believe that the net impact of these\nshifts is not material enough to derail the US economic expansion or bull market.\nRisks that have abated\nMexico: the election of the left-of-center populist president (Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador referred\nto as AMLO) has reduced fear of a reversal of recent reforms. While concerns about fiscal profligacy\nand reverting to a nationalist energy policy that reduces oil production may reappear, AMLO does not\ntake office until the end of the year.\nBrazil: The strong showing of Jair Bolsonaro, a law-and-order former army captain, in the first round\nof elections and the latest data that points to a 75% probability of Bolsonaro becoming the next\npresident of Brazil has provided a boost to the Brazilian real. His current standing has substantially\nreduced the election of another left-wing worker’s party candidate who would keep the status quo in\nBrazil.\nNAFTA: The agreement on a revised NAFTA deal between the US, Canada, and Mexico on\nSeptember 30th meaningfully reduced the risk of the US withdrawal from NAFTA. While the new\nagreement, US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), has not been ratified by the Mexican and\nCanadian national parliaments nor by the US congress, and a divided congress after the mid-term\nelections may lead to some uncertainty, we believe it is likely to be ratified.\nUS-EU Trade Friction: Tension between the US and European Union eased significantly after a July\n2018 deal between European Commission President Juncker and President Trump to “work together\ntoward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods”. The\ncoast is not totally clear given the threat of auto tariffs, but we do not anticipate any significant\nincrease in trade rhetoric in the near future.\nRisks that have increased\nChina: The trade war with China continues to escalate and as we have stated before, we believe that\nit cannot be resolved simply by China importing more US goods. The issues range from:\n�\n�\n�\nA large and growing trade deficit with China\nIndustrial policies & unfair trade practices that reduce competition, such as subsidies and\n“dumping good at below-market prices”\n“Made in China 2025” policies which “harm US companies”\n7\nPrice Indexed to 12/31/2017\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\nUneven tariff rates and the banning of some US goods\nIntellectual property theft\nForced technology transfer\nStrategic US technology acquisitions\nOutright cyber theft\nForeign ownership restrictions\nRecent headlines that the trade war may be escalating to a cold war are not without merit, as we\nbelieve that US-China relations are changing on a more structural basis and will have a longer-term\nimpact. On a short-term basis, however, US exposure to China is limited with merchandise exports,\ncorporate profits and foreign claims at about 1% of GDP. As seen in Exhibit 7, the Chinese equity\nmarkets have also deteriorated much more significantly than US markets in 2018.\nOf course, specific stocks with greater exposure to China through higher sales have underperformed\nthe S&P 500 by about 6% since the latest tariffs were imposed on $200bn of Chinese products, as\nshown in Exhibit 8.\n7.

The government’s\nexpansive fiscal plan, with a proposed budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP, may be rejected by the\nEuropean Union commission and result in rating downgrades. While the EU is likely to manage this\nsituation in its usual incremental and reactive way, the possibility of new elections in late 2019\nreigniting euro viability questions will keep Italy on our radar screens.\nBREXIT: It is hard to know whether Brexit risks are unchanged, higher or lower given the minute by\nminute headlines out of the UK. Our base case remains that while the internal politics of the\nConservative party will keep uncertainty at elevated levels and the European Union will not\ncompromise on its key tenants of free movement of goods, services, and people, the two sides will\nagree to a deal that defers the difficult choices on the shape of a final agreement with the EU until late\n2020.\nThe Middle East: Risks in the Middle East have not changed substantially with respect to Iraq, Syria,\nor even the impositions of sanctions on Iran. However, the disappearance of the Saudi journalist who\nentered the Saudi Embassy in Turkey on October 2 nd has the potential to raise risks to global oil\nsupply. While there has been a global uproar, it is not yet clear whether the US will impose serious\nsanctions or Saudi Arabia would retaliate by reducing oil exports if the US finds sufficient evidence\nregarding the alleged killing of the Saudi journalist. The recession in 1973-74 was partly due to the\nquadrupling of oil prices due to the Arab Oil Embargo. Later in that decade, the Iranian Revolution\nand the Iran-Iraq War also led to a 2.5 times spike in oil prices that, along with Federal Reserve\ntightening by then Chairman Paul Volcker, led to a US recession. While we think it is unlikely that\nSaudi Arabia would react so aggressively in the face of serious US reprisals, we note that it remains a\nreal risk.\n9\nCumulative Mutual Fund and ETF Flows ($Bn)\nSome Notable Observations\nUS Equities Have Been Shunned All Along\nIn both our 2018 Outlook and mid-year update, we highlighted the surprising absence of inflows into\nUS equities based on flows into mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds. As shown in Exhibit 9,\nflows into US equities were negative in 2018, even before the recent downdraft. In fact, US equities\nhave seen outflows of $81 billion through August 2018 (based on the most recent comprehensive\ndata), while non-US developed equities and emerging market equities have had inflows of $72 billion\nand $20 billion respectively. This is further evidence of our view that while sentiment and short term\npositioning among speculators and hedge fund managers shifts frequently, more stable investors\nhave shunned US equities during this long bull market in favor of other developed and emerging\nmarket equities and global bonds.\nThis steady outflow of assets from US equities has been offset by record levels of stock buybacks by\nUS companies given high levels of profitability and incremental cash from repatriation of overseas\nearnings, as mentioned above.\n9.

Even so, each of the\nstocks, with the exception of Facebook, still have positive year-to-date returns and have outperformed\nthe S&P 500, as shown in Exhibit 10.\n10\n10.

Anyone looking to buy or sell single name\nequities should consult Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\nNevertheless, we believe that some of the headwinds that have plagued this sector will continue.\nThese include:\n�\n�\n�\nData privacy issues impacting a broad range of companies, including Facebook, Google,\nTwitter, Alipay and Tencent.\nHigh likelihood of greater regulatory scrutiny in the US 2 and Europe as policy makers\nincreasingly believe that these companies will not address “the privacy and security issues of\nsocial media users” 3 on their own.\nIncreased focus by ESG investors (Environment, Social, and Governance) that many of the\ntechnology and social media companies are falling short on social and governance issues.\nWhile this basket of stocks may or may not lead the market in the future, it is important to note that\nthey represent only 10% of S&P 500 earnings.\nInvestment Implications\nThe recent market downdraft has understandably rekindled fears that the longest bull market in\nhistory is coming to an end. While there are no certainties in investing, we do not think the odds\nsupport that conclusion based on our read of the steady and unsteady factors discussed above. Keep\nin mind that about 75% of historical US bear markets—defined here as equity market declines of 20%\nor more—have occurred during economic recessions. In fact, US equity returns have remained\nfavorable until about five to six months prior to the onset of recession, highlighting the penalty for\nprematurely exiting the market (see Exhibit 11). With only 10% odds of recession over the next year,\nwe think the economic backdrop remains favorable for stocks.\n11\nAverage 6m Price Return\n% of Positive Price Returns\n11.

Yet these statistics alone do not justify underweighting\nequities, since such pullbacks often occur after sizable equity rallies, as this year reminds us.\nMoreover, such pullbacks are quite normal historically. After all, stocks have suffered a median of two\npullbacks of at least 5% and one of at least 10% per calendar year in the post-WWII period, leaving\nboth the frequency and magnitude of this year’s dips in line with past experience. Most importantly,\nyears that experienced a similar number of pullbacks as 2018 nonetheless ended with a median gain\nof 6% and had 77% odds of a positive return.\nConclusion\nAlthough we have painted a less alarmist view of recent market weakness, we are by no means\nPollyannaish. While bull markets do not die of old age, they do become more susceptible to ailments\nover time. Yet as we survey the tug of war between the steady factors and the unsteady undertow,\nwe do not think the balance of risks is strong enough to topple the ongoing US expansion and the\ncontinued growth of corporate earnings it supports.\nThat said, this viewpoint does not preclude further market volatility and the market may still make new\nlows if the current downdraft persists. But history suggests the bull market is likely to continue until\nabout 5-6 months prior to the end of this economic expansion. Thus, it will take a significant increase\nin the odds of an imminent recession to provide the trigger—that has been lacking thus far—to\ntactically underweight equities. In the interim, we continue to recommend that clients maintain their\nstrategic allocation to US equities.\n12\nSources: Investment Strategy Group, Bank for International Settlements, Bloomberg, Datastream, Goldman Sachs Global\nInvestment Research, Haver, International Monetary Fund, Teneo Intelligence.\nEndnotes:\n(1) Kate Davidson and Sarah Chaney, “Fed Chair Powell Sees ‘Remarkably Positive Set of Economic\nCircumstances,’” The Wall Street Journal, October 3, 2018.\n(2) Statement by the Acting Director of FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection Regarding Reported Concerns about\nFacebook Privacy Practices, March 26, 2018.\n(3) Senator Mark.
