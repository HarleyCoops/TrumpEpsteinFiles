[jeevacation@gmail.com] \nSent: 5/4/2016 6:28:25 PM \nTo: soon yi previn \nSubject: Fwd: woody and deadline \n??? \n----------Forwarded message---------- \nFrom: Lisa New < \nDate: Wed, May 4, 2016 at 2:25 PM \nSubject: woody and deadline \nTo: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nDear Jeffrey, \nWoody has received from his lawyer some questions I asked in in response to the agreement Irwin Tenenbaum \nsent me... .1 found that that agreement generous and reasonable (!), and I'm excited to go forward, but I do need \nthose clarifications. We can absolutely agree that we will not give Woody larger or more important billing than \nBill Clinton or Joe Biden, and that I'd like to come to him to renew our agreement after five years. \nThe Harvard week of content in which Woody will appear, if we can sign this, needs to be edited in the next \nweek-10 days. We are out of time, which is why I'm writing \nThe television show has been picked up by American Public Television, they will distribute nationally, and \nthey've asked for another 5 episodes. I so want Woody to be one of those. \nI'd like to see the haiku written by computer. Haiku is not that hard. I'd like to see an elegy written by \ncomputer. \nLisa \nElisa New \nPowell M.
