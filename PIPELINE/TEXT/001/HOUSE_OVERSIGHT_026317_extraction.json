He would come up from DC. We can always do Skype, of course, but \nPeter would appreciate to meet in person early in the process. Breakthroughs is a Big Project, big opportunity \nfor impact.

We've been coordinating with colleagues at HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Association) \nas well as National Geographic for staffing referrals, and now have a strong short list. This is a critical, long-\nterm position. \n• We are assessing graphics and animation companies and researching styles and graphic ideas that we might \nuse to communicate some of the more complex ideas. \n• Our digital team is researching a web extension for the www.closertotruth.com website, developing ideas for \na dedicated site neighborhood for \"Radical Breakthroughs.\" We are in discussions with several website \ndesign companies, including the company that designed and built our original CTT site, for ideas and bids on \ncreating the expanded site. \n• By mid-October, we expect to begin to schedule the shoots. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026318 \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
