Often, in answering this question, commentators point to \nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinions answering in the contrary. To whatever extent the \nwriter agrees or disagrees with the opinions' conclusion, the government's position on the \nmatter is usually presented as a long-standing and clear \"no.\" \nThe reality is more complicated. The United States has addressed this question six times in \nboth internal memos and briefs filed in litigation. And a review of these documents shows \nthat it is far from clear what criminal prosecution steps are (or should be) precluded___and \nthat there is no \"longstanding policy\" against indictment of the president. Consider the 1973 \nOLC memo stating that a sitting president should not be indicted. Far from being \nauthoritative, it was essentially repudiated within months by the Justice Department in the \nUnited States' filing in the Supreme Court in United States v. Nixon. \nLikewise, the most recent opinion___an OLC memo written in 2000___includes brief \nstatements that a sitting president should not be indicted even if all further proceedings are \npostponed. But far from being definitive, this is a matter that could be reconsidered by the \ndepartment. Moreover, of course, OLC opinions are not binding on state prosecutors (though \nstate charges could raise federalism questions as well). The complex history of criminal \nproceedings against presidents and vice presidents suggests that these issues are not \nforeclosed. \nPerhaps the most important point that emerges from a review of all the opinions is this: nly \nonce has the United States addressed the question of whether a president can be an \nunindicted co-conspirator. The conclusion was an unequivocal yes. Richard Nixon was so \nnamed in the Watergate indictment, and that inclusion was sustained by Judge John Sirica \nand defended by the United States in United States v. Nixon. (The Supreme Court did not \nresolve the question.) No department opinion or filing has ever contradicted that position. \nThe fact that it is permissible to name a sitting president as unindicted co-conspirator, \nmoreover, tends significantly to undermine the only argument against indicting a sitting \npresident. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030200 \n(I should note that the U.S. Attorney's manual cautions against naming persons as \nunindicted co-conspirators \"[in the absence of some significant justification.\" Here, of \ncourse, the \"significant justification\" would exist if a sitting president is the only individual \nin the country who is immune from indictment. Thus, for that individual alone, the usual \nbetter course of indictment would not be available.) \nHere I want to review each of the half-dozen times that the executive branch has addressed \nthe question of whether a president can be prosecuted, indicted or included as an unindicted \nco-conspirator. The opinions that conclude that a president cannot be indicted deal mainly \nwith the question of whether a president can be put on trial. While the discussions of the \noption of indicting but postponing trial are more than a mere afterthought, that option was \nnot the focus of the opinions and received scant analysis. \nThe relevant briefs and memoranda are: \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \nThe Sept. 24, 1973, OLC Dixon memo  \nThe Oct. 5, 1973, brief for the United States in In re Agnew  \nThe Feb. 12, 1974, memorandum to Independent Counsel Leon Jaworski \nThe June 21, 1974, reply brief for the United States in U.S. v. Nixon  \nThe May 13, 1998, memorandum to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr \nThe Oct. 16, 2000, OLC memorandum  \nThese documents are worth review not only for their value as precedent but also for the \nextensive argumentation they contain on the pertinent issues. \n1. The Sept. 24, 1973, OLC Dixon Memo. This memo, signed by the head of the Office of \nLegal Counsel, Robert Dixon, is a procedural anomaly: It was not addressed to any official \nand may not have been made public at the time. It was not mentioned in the submission by \nthe solicitor general two weeks later in the In re Agnew case. \nDixon noted that there was no express provision of the Constitution conferring any \nimmunity upon the president. The \"proper approach\" he wrote, \"is to find the proper balance \nbetween the normal functions of the courts and the special responsibilities ... of the \nPresidency.\" He concluded that \"criminal proceedings against a President in office should \nnot go beyond a point where they could result in so serious a physical interference with the \nPresident's performance of his official duties that it would amount to an incapacitation.\" \nThus, \"a necessity to defend a criminal trial and to attend court ... would interfere with the \nPresident's unique official duties.\" \nFinally, Dixon addressed \"a possibility not yet mentioned\": that a sitting president could be \nindicted but further proceedings could be deferred until he was no longer in office. Unlike \nplacing a president on trial, this would not result in a \"physical interference\" with the \npresident's duties. Nevertheless, the memo concludes that this step should not be taken \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030201 \nbecause of the reputational damage to the president: \"The spectacle of an indicted President \nstill trying to serve as Chief Executive boggles the imagination.\" \nOf particular interest is the memo's consideration of whether criminal proceedings against a \nvice president are precluded. OLC found this to be a difficult question before concluding \nthat a grand jury could indict the vice president. The memo notes that Vice President Spiro \nAgnew was said to be part of a conspiracy and that it would be difficult to have a proper \nindictment of co-conspirators without including the vice president (a point also true of a \nconspiracy involving a president). Moreover, \nAnother circumstance counselling prompt presentation of evidence to the grand jury is that \nthe statute of limitations is about to bar prosecution of the alleged offenders with respect to \nsome or all of the offenses. The problem presented by the statute of limitations would be \navoided by an indictment within the statutorily specified period. \n(The issue of statute of limitations arises as well in cases involving a president.) \nThe Dixon memo concludes that \"[a]fter indictment, the question of whether the \nGovernment should ... delay prosecution until the expiration of the Vice President's duties \ninvolves questions of trial strategy\" beyond OLC's expertise. \nThe conclusion that the sitting president should not be indicted was not necessarily a \ncategorical constitutional-judgment conclusion but seems, rather, to be a balance of policy \nconsiderations. That, it appears, is how it was read by the office of Special Prosecutor Leon \nJaworski___as I will describe below. \n2. The Oct. 5, 1973, Brief for the United States in In re Agnew. Lawyers for Vice \nPresident Spiro T. Agnew argued that if a president could not be indicted while in office, \nthat same immunity should apply to a serving vice president. The vice president should have \nthe same immunity as the president, they wrote, because he \"must maintain himself in a state \nof constant preparation to replace the president.\" And as the official with responsibility for \ninitiating the 25th Amendment removal process, he must \"continuously ... monitor the \nability of the President\" to discharge his duties. These responsibilities, they argued, were \nincompatible with being a defendant in a criminal case. Agnew's civil action, moreover, \nsought to enjoin the grand jury from even \"conducting any investigation\" into the allegations \nagainst Agnew as well as precluding \"issuing any indictment.\" \nThe United States, in a response filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by \nSolicitor General Robert Bork, opposed any immunity from criminal process for a vice \npresident. The solicitor general did inform the court, however, that if the grand jury were to \nreturn an indictment, the Department of Justice \"will hold the proceedings in abeyance for a \nreasonable time, if the Vice President consents to a delay, in order to offer the House of \nRepresentatives an opportunity to consider the desirability of impeachment proceedings.\" \nWhat was critical, according to Bork, was this: \"The issuance of an indictment ... would in \nthe meantime toll the statute of limitations and preserve the matter for subsequent judicial \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030202 \nresolution.\" The memorandum concluded that while the demands of the presidency preclude \nsubjecting the chief executive to criminal process, no such importance attaches to the office \nof the vice president. \nBecause Agnew pleaded no contest to an indictment in a negotiated agreement, there was no \nresolution of his claim of immunity from indictment. Although the charges had been serious \n(Agnew was said to have accepted containers of cash in the White House), he was allowed \nto plead to a single count and serve no prison time, essentially in exchange for his \nresignation from the vice presidency___an outcome that may not have been possible had \nAgnew not been susceptible to indictment. \n3. The Feb. 12, 1974, Memorandum to Independent Counsel Leon Jaworski. The \nattorneys in the Office of Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski concluded that there \nwas no legal bar to indicting a sitting president and that the office should recommend either \nthat the grand jury indict President Nixon or that criminal charges against him be \nincorporated into a formal grand jury presentment. Jaworski concluded that the best course, \nwith impeachment proceedings in the offing, was to include Nixon as an unindicted co-\nconspirator in the indictment of the other Watergate defendants. \nThe memo notes at the outset that \nAs we understand it, the conclusions regarding indictment of an incumbent President \nreached by the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney's office, and this office, are all \nconsistent: there is nothing in the language or legislative history of the Constitution that \nbars indictment of a sitting president, but there are a number of 'policy' factors that weigh \nheavily against it. \nThe memo finds those policy considerations offset by competing considerations. \nFor us or the grand jury to shirk from an appropriate expression of our honest assessment of \nthe evidence of the President's guilt would not only be a departure from our responsibilities \nbut a dangerous precedent damaging to the rule of law. \nIn deciding whether to indict a sitting president, they asserted, any considerations of a \npolitical nature should be left to Congress, which can decide if it wishes to immunize a \npresident from prosecution. The special prosecutor's office did conclude, however, that the \nquantum of proof required to support an indictment of a sitting president should be quite \nhigh: \"the evidence of the President's guilt should be direct, clear, and compelling and ... \nadmit of no misinterpretation.\" \nSome of Jaworski '5 team thought that President Nixon should be indicted. Others favored \nproceeding by a \"presentment,\" which would set out \"in detail the most important evidence \nand the Grand Jury's conclusion that the President has violated certain criminal statutes and \nwould have been indicted were he not President.\" The office concluded that \"there appears \nto be no question of the propriety or legality of such a course....\" The memo noted that \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030203 \nhaving the grand jury actually name the specific indictable crimes for which there was clear \nevidence of guilt was important: \"This fundamental conclusion [of criminal guilt] should not \nbe allowed to be lost in a recitation of facts or sources of evidence that omits the basic \njudgment involved or leaves it open to public (and Congressional) speculation and debate.\" \nThe memo also noted that the president could be named an unindicted co-conspirator in the \nindictment of the other conspirators, the course ultimately chosen by Jaworski. \n4. The June 21, 1974, Reply Brief for the United States in US v. Nixon. The U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia refused Nixon's motion to expunge his inclusion as an \nunindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate indictment. Nixon asked the Supreme Court to \nreverse that decision. His lawyers argued that since a sitting president could not be indicted, \nneither should he be implicated as an unindicted co-conspirator. \nIn this filing on behalf of the United States, Jaworski rejected Nixon's premise that a \npresident could not be indicted, stating that \"It is an open and substantial question whether \nan incumbent President is subject to indictment.\" The brief argues for indictability before \nconcluding that it is unnecessary to decide that question in order to resolve whether to permit \nhis inclusion as an unindicted co-conspirator. \n(Despite the filing's origin in Jaworski's office, it would be a mistake to argue that this filing \nwas not in some sense the position of the Department of Justice. Leon Jaworski and his \nattorneys were officers of the Department of Justice assigned by the attorney general the \nresponsibility for advancing the legal positions of the United States, including in \nrepresentations to the U.S. Supreme Court.) \nThe Jaworski filing notes how critical it is to identify the president as one of the criminal \naccused: \"the identification of each co-conspirator___regardless of station____is a \nprerequisite to making his declarations in furtherance of the conspiracy admissible against \nthe other conspirators.\" \nAlthough the brief concludes that \"it is by no means clear that a President is immune from \nindictment\" during his term, the special prosecutor chose not to indict the sitting president \non the basis of \"practical arguments.\" Those arguments, however, \ncannot fairly be stretched to confer immunity on the President from being identified as an \nunindicted co-conspirator, when it is necessary to do so in connection with criminal \nproceedings against persons unquestionably liable to indictment. \nNaming the president as an unindicted co-conspirator was necessary for the grand jury to \nreturn a \"true bill,\" Jaworski argued, and \"required here to outline the full range of the \nalleged conspiracy.\" There exists, moreover, \"a legitimate public purpose in reporting the \nfact that serious criminal charges against a government official have been made.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030204 \n1 \n1 \nThe mere fact that an official has a personal immunity from prosecution does not bar the \nprosecution from alleging and proving his complicity as part of a case against persons who \nhave no such immunity. \nIt would not be fair \"to the defendants ... to blunt the sweep of the evidence artificially by \nexcluding one person, however prominent and important, while identifying all others.\" The \nJaworski filing acknowledged that naming an incumbent president as an unindicted criminal \nco-conspirator may cause the public anguish of a cloud over the presidency. But \"in the \npublic marketplace of ideas\" there is little reason to fear that malicious charges against a \npresident \"will receive credit they do not deserve.\" \nNotably, the United States made no mention of the OLC Dixon memo in its filing in the \nSupreme Court other than by implication: The filing says that the Department of Justice \nagrees that the Constitution does not bar indictment of a president, perhaps reading the \nDixon OLC memo as merely a statement of policy. What is striking is that the 2000 OLC \nmemo treats the 1973 Dixon memo as an important precedent but not the more substantial, \nmore careful subsequent filing in the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThe Supreme Court did not answer Nixon's request to expunge his inclusion as an \nunindicted co-conspirator. Finding it unnecessary to answer that question in order to rule \nagainst the president on the subpoena of the nine tapes, the court dismissed Nixon's \ncompanion cert petition as improvidently granted. Nixon's resignation and pardon rendered \nthe remaining questions moot. \n5. The May 13, 1998, Memorandum to Independent Counsel Starr. This memorandum \nwas written by professor Ronald Rotunda in response to an inquiry from Independent \nCounsel Kenneth Starr. Rotunda concluded that \nIn the circumstances of this case, President Clinton is subject to indictment and criminal \nprosecution, although it may be the case that he could not be imprisoned ... until after he \nleaves that office. \nThe Rotunda memo is the least persuasive of the opinions in question. First, its status is \nunclear. It says that the question was posed by Starr, but it does not note whether Rotunda, \nwho may have been a paid consultant, had any official governmental role. There is no \nindication that the opinion underwent any review by other officials. \nThe opinion seems to claim too much, in my view, by suggesting that a president could be \nnot only indicted but actually put on trial while serving. (Rotunda does not even rule out \nimprisoning a president.) There is an informal and partisan flavor to the memo that makes it \nless serious than the other arguments put forth by the department. \nRotunda argues that the then-existing Independent Counsel Act contemplated that a \npresident could be investigated and questioned, so therefore it must follow that he can be \nindicted. This is the obverse of the current argument made by some that since a president \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030205 \ncan't be indicted, he can't be questioned. Both positions are based on category mistake. No \none has ever seriously suggested that a president can never be indicted. The only debate is \nwhether any indictment of a president must be postponed until he is no longer in office. \nSince any president can indisputably be indicted when no longer in office, there is no \npermanent immunity that would obviate questioning of a president. \n6. The 2000 OLC Memorandum. This opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, signed by \nAssistant Attorney General Randolph Moss, is a thorough and thoughtful analysis of \nwhether a president can be indicted and prosecuted while serving in office. It appears to \nhave originally been drafted during the time of the Starr investigation of President Bill \nClinton. The case against putting a president on trial is fully convincing to me. What is not \nso clear, however, is whether there is sound basis for withholding an indictment of a \npresident even if any trial proceedings must await the end of his term. Like the Dixon memo, \nthe 2000 opinion set out several obstacles to trying a president. None of those reasons, save \none, applies to naming a president in an indictment. \nThe 2000 opinion gives so little thought to the possibility of indicting-and-postponing that it \ngives only one reason why such a course should be precluded: the idea that including the \npresident in an indictment would cast a \"cloud\" over the presidency. The notion that \nreputational harm alone should preclude a normal part of the system of justice seems \nincompatible with the Supreme Court's decision in Clinton v. Jones, in which the court set \nsuch a high bar for any presidential immunity from the normal process of litigation that not a \nsingle justice found that actually undergoing a civil trial was precluded. \nIt is hard to square mere reputational harm as a basis for precluding indictment when the \ngovernment seems to have established that a president can be listed as an unindicted co-\nconspirator. The reputational difference between being named as an unindicted co-\nconspirator in a criminal indictment and being listed as one of those indicted seems \nrelatively small. The essential difference: naming one as indicted prevents the statute of \nlimitations from expiring. Why, for a small reputational difference, would one choose to \nmake being in the White House a basis for permanently precluding (by operation of the \nstatute of limitations) an otherwise warranted criminal prosecution? \nOne aspect of the 2000 memo is worth noting. It appears to have been drafted with the case \nagainst President Clinton in mind. That was essentially a one-defendant matter. Thus, the \nopinion does not grapple with the significant obstacles to trying a multi-defendant criminal \nconspiracy while excluding from the charging document any reference to one of the \nconspirators___and perhaps a key conspirator. \nFor an extended argument that the terms of Robert Mueller's appointment and practice of \nthe Office of Legal Counsel do not require him to conform to the 2000 OLC position \nopinion rejecting the option of indicting and postponing, see Andrew Crespo's analysis. In \naddition to Crespo's analysis, I would add that the 2000 memo gives only scant attention to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030206 \nthe possible course I believe deserves most consideration when a sitting president has been \nfound to have committed a crime: indict-and-postpone. While I would not call the few \nmentions of that possibility \"mere dicta,\" I believe the scant discussion of the point should \nnot preclude an independent judgment by subsequent officials. The notion that such a course \nwould cause reputational harm___though it would not physically interfere with the \npresident's attention to his duties___seems to be a point of policy, not constitutional law. For \na helpful analysis of this question, see Bob Bauer's posting. \nIn any event, OLC has never suggested that a president cannot be an unindicted co-\nconspirator. \nConclusions \nThe history of positions taken by the executive branch of the United States on the indictment \nof a sitting president is more varied and complex than is generally assumed. For that reason, \nwhether or not a president can be indicted or named as an unindicted co-conspirator should \nnot be considered a settled question. \nI am convinced that putting a president on trial would be inconsistent with the Article II \nresponsibilities of the modern presidency. Others___Larry Tribe included___are less certain \nand also point to the 25th Amendment, arguing that if being on trial or incarcerated \nprecluded a president from being able to perform his duties, the 25th Amendment provides a \ntheoretical if impractical avenue for the vice president to take over in successive 21-day \nincrements during that time. I see the point, but I believe that approach could too easily set \naside the determination of the electorate. People vote for a president, not a vice president. It \nwould be no small matter, for example, to have had Sarah PalM step in for John McCain. \nIf a guilty president is not to be indicted, he or she should in any event be included in the \ncharging instrument as an unindicted co-conspirator, an option that has been expressly \ndefended by the United States before the Supreme Court. And once it has been established \nthat a president can be an unindicted co-conspirator, the case for categorically precluding \nindictment of a president is significantly weakened. \nI have argued previously that there should be no categorical bar to the indictment of a sitting \npresident. Clinton v. Jones establishes that a president has a substantial burden of showing \nthat normal processes of litigation are incompatible with his duties___and while that showing \ncan be made for an actual criminal trial, it is difficult to make such a showing for naming a \npresident in a grand jury indictment as long as trial proceedings are postponed until a \npresident is no longer in office. \nWhat, then, is the argument against indictment? Perhaps it casts a greater cloud. On the other \nhand, the most important reason for issuing an indictment, rather than merely naming the \npresident as unindicted co-conspirator, is to prevent the statute of limitations from expiring. \nThis, in my view, is an important consideration. Indeed, a president might seek reelection \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030207 \njust to make sure the limitations period runs on all his or her crimes while he or she remains \nin office. \nBut concluding that a president can be indicted does not mean that he or she should be \nindicted, even if that would be called for by the normal operation of the criminal process. \nAwaiting action by the House of Representatives may in some circumstances be the prudent \ncourse___though one might question whether it is appropriate to weigh that institutional \nfactor variously depending on how realistic it is that a particular House and Senate would \ntake their responsibilities seriously. \nSome offenses might be seen as better suited for initial consideration by Congress in the \nimpeachment process. Whether an exercise of executive authority___such as discharging an \nofficial or pardoning someone for an allegedly corrupt reason___should be grounds for \nsanction might be seen as requiring an essential political judgment, perhaps best suited for \nelected officials to make. On the other hand, the regular processes of the federal criminal \nsystem might be a better forum for an alleged complex multi-defendant financial conspiracy \nincluding money laundering, bank fraud, tax evasion, etc. In short, context matters for a \nspecial counsel or other prosecutor considering how best to proceed. \nThere is good reason to have the judiciary decide the question of whether an indictment of a \nsitting president is categorically barred. This is especially the case now that the decision \nprocess would in significant part be based upon an interpretation of a Supreme Court \ndecision, Clinton v. Jones. If a prosecutor included the president in an indictment, the \npresident would no doubt move to have his or her name stricken. The first question a judge \nshould ask is, \"If I strike the president from the indictment, will he or she agree to waive any \ndefense of the statute of limitations that may expire while he or she is in office?\" If the \npresident refuses to waive the statute of limitations, that itself would be a good reason for \npermitting the indictment, while postponing any further proceedings. \nIt is impossible to predict whether a prosecutor would ask the attorney general for \nauthorization to indict____or to make the president an unindicted co-conspirator___without \nknowing the degree and nature of any criminality that might be uncovered, and how \nincluding or not including the president in an indictment would affect the trial of other \nconspirators. But the possibility of including the president in an indictment is not \ncategorically foreclosed. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030208 \n"
