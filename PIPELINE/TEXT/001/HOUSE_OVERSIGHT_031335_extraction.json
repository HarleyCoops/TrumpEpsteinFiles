Omar, however, and exactly like Strauss-Kahn before him, has been \nchargedby the US with a sex crime against aluxury hotelmaid, a charge the FSB labels as beyond belief as Omar is 74-years-old and a devout \nMuslim. \nIn an astounding move puzzling many in Moscow, Putin after reading thissecretFSB report ordered posted to the Kremlins official website a \ndefense of Strauss-Khan becoming thefirst world leader to state that the former IMF chief was a victim of a US conspiracy. \nOne of the United States top Congressman, and 2012 Presidential candidate, Ron Paul has long stated his belief that the US government has \nlied about itsgoldreserves held at Fort Knox. And in 2010 put forward a bill force an audit of them, .The bill was defeated,but which was \nsubsequently defeated by Obama regime forces. \nWhen directly asked by reporters if he believed there was nogoldin Fort Knox or the Federal Reserve, Congressman Paul gave the incredible \nreply, I think it is a possibility. \nAlso interesting to note is that barely 3 days after the arrest of Strauss-Kahn, Congressman Paul made a new call for the US to sell \nitsgoldreserves by stating, Given the high price it is now, and the tremendous debt problem we now have, by all means, sell at the peak. \nReports emanating from the US for years, however, suggest there is nogoldto sell. \nNew reports coming from the United States show his determination not to go down without a fight as he has hired what is described as a \ncrack team of former CIA spies, private investigators and media advisers to defend him. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031335 \nOb Monday Russias Central Bank yesterdayordered the interest rateraised from 0.25 to 3.5 percent and Putin ordered the export ban on \nwheat and grain cropslifted by July lin a move designed to fill Russias coffers with money that normally would have flowed to the US. \nIncoming search terms: \n• dsk fort knox \n• dsk gold \n• strauss kahn fort knox \n• strauss-kahn fort knox \n• strauss kahn gold \n• strauss kahn jailed no gold \n• Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar fort knox \n• putin gold fort knox \n• dominique strauss kahn gold \n• putin re missing us gold/dsk \n• dominique strauss kahn fort knox \n• fort knox gold missing \n• straus kahn \n• stros kan fort nox cia \n• putin fort knox \n• dsk gold fort knox \n• straus khan and gold \n• dominique strauss-kahn maid us gold \n• kahn and gold \n• stros kan and fort nox conspirasy \n• Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar Putin Strauss-Kahn \n• strauss-kahn gold \n• Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar gold \n• strauss kahn gold knox \n• conspiracy behind Strauss kahn arrest \nLeave a Reply \nTop of Form \nName (required) \nMail (will not be published) (required) \nWebsite \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031336 \nX \nSubmit Comment \nBottom of Form \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031337 \n"
