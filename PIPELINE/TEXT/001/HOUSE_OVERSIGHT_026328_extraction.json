But I don't think anything is going to get attention now. I \nwould look for some reporter to do a more nuanced post-morten on the case--with it's Trump overtones, legal \njoustings, #metoo-isms, and profit-motives. WSJ is probably right place. \nOn Tue, Dec 4, 2018 at 7:59 AM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \ndo you think the press would react to the fact that all the settlement money is going to the attorney and none to \nthe girls.? react to the fact that the case was settled but the lawyers wanted to trumpet their success. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
