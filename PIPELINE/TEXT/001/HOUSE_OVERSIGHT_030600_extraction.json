You have friends saying they don't believe you would act in this way and you need to say that you did not. \n\t\n\tThe Mail website is read by 193 million I don't see how a statement denying the allegations will make matters worse which is the acid test. It will make your position better as you will a strong open denial on record. These allegations must not gain traction.\n\t\n\tI wont say anymore as I have given my advice - call me.\n\t\n\tBest\n\t\n\tPhilip \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\thttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2900787/Prince-Andrew-Heidi-Klum-Hookers-Pimps-party-New-York-socialite-accused-procuring-underage-girls-billionaire-pedophile-Jeffrey-Epstein.html\n\t\n\n________________________________\n\n\n\tThis email is intended for the addressee named within only.
