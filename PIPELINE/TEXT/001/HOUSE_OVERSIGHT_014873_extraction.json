This report is intended for jake.byrne@baml.com\nShort interest ratio: catalyst for recovery\nOver the past six months Hess has been one of the most volatile stocks in the sector, facing\nheadwinds from a significant increase in short interest that has exaggerated volatility. From\ndiscussions with investors, the arguments against Hess seem to begin and end with a\ncombination of declining production and an expanding balance sheet – all part of the\ndeliberate portfolio choices that favored completing major projects at the expense of short\ncycle production. We expect this to end in 2Q17 with a rebound in oil and gas production\nstarting in 2H17 and critically, an inflection in free cash flow that we expect will return Hess\nto free cash flow with the flexibility to re-up investment in the Bakken. We thus would view\nHess as a dangerous ‘short’ for investors seeking to hedge other portfolio risks.\nInflection point on multiple levels right around the corner\nWe believe Hess’ investment case is approaching an inflection point on multiple levels.\nWe expect oil and gas production to trough in 2Q17, with a rebound of 60,000 boepd or\n22%, by 4Q17 marking the single biggest sequential change in production of any\ncompany in the sector. This is likely to kickstart an extended period of growth in\n2018/19 but with the contribution from Guyana driving a step change in Hess’ growth\ntrajectory through 2025. Near term, we think Hess is also poised for an inflection in free\ncash flow that is reasonably $1bn annualized, with $700mm irrespective of oil prices.\nVersus consensus operating cash flow of ~$1.9bn in 2017, this stands out as the biggest\nswing in free cash of any company in the sector.\nAdding Hess to US 1 ‘best ideas’ list\nAfter a year of waiting, we believe the inflection point in Hess’ investment case is just around\nthe corner, with the broader sector pullback positioning the shares with amongst the highest\nupside in the sector as implied by our price objectives. At current levels, Hess ‘discounts’ strip\noil prices. Under our base case, which assumes a rebound in oil prices towards $70 from 2020\nfair value is reasonably ~$80 per share. If non-producing asset value from Guyana is included\nwe estimate this would be closer to $90. BofAML’s US1 list is a collection of the firm’s best\ninvestment ideas managed with the goal of providing superior investment performance over\nthe long term. For Hess, we believe the combination of catalysts, short interest and absolute\nvalue can drive a period of strong relative outperformance vs peers. For this reason, Hess\nreplaces DVN as the energy stock on BofAML’s US 1 list.\nEstimates (Dec)\n(US$) 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E 2019E\nEPS (3.92) (4.94) (3.75) (1.46) (0.76)\nGAAP EPS (10.77) (19.92) (3.75) (1.46) (0.76)\nEPS Change (YoY) NM -26.0% 24.1% 61.1% 47.9%\nConsensus EPS (Bloomberg) (3.03) (2.09) (0.45)\nDPS 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00\nValuation (Dec)\n2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E 2019E\nP/E NM NM NM NM NM\nGAAP P/E NM NM NM NM NM\nDividend Yield 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0%\nEV / EBITDA* 17.2x NM 9.9x 6.4x 5.4x\nFree Cash Flow Yield* -13.2% -8.7% -3.8% -0.3% 3.7%\n* For full definitions of iQmethod SM measures, see page 11.\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.

From discussions with investors, the arguments against Hess begin and end\nwith a combination of declining production and expanding balance sheet – all part of the\ndeliberate portfolio choices that favored completing major projects at the expense of\nshort cycle production.\nThis cycle ends in 2Q17 with an expected rebound in oil and gas production starting in\n2H17 and critically, an inflection in free cash flow that by our estimates should return\nHess to free cash flow with the flexibility to re-up investment in the Bakken.

With start-up of the first of two\nmajor projects (NMB 1 ) and incremental production in the US GoM, we\nanticipate growth in oil and gas production of ~60,000boepd or 22% between\n2Q17 & 4Q17.\n• Planned increase in Bakken rig count points to an exit rate of ~105–110\nkboepd up from 90-95 kboepd in 1Q17 for an intra-year growth rate of ~16%\nunderpinned by a step up to 6 rigs from 2 at the start of the year. We expect\nBakken growth to continue in 2018 and 2019 at ~16% yoy with upside from\nlarger completions.\nManagement guidance suggests exit rate production in 2017 of ~335,000 boepd; startup\nof the second of Hess’ major projects (Stampede) adds 15,000 boepd from 1H18\n(est); along with a resumption of growth by resurgent operator Aker BP at Valhall (Hess\n64%) we expect top line growth of 15% in 2018 with a FY contribution and continued\nBakken ramp contributing to ~10% growth in 2019 including first oil from Guyana.\n1\nNorth Malay Basin, adding 20,000 boepd starting in Sep 2017\nHess Corp. | 11 April 2017 3\nIn other words, 2Q17 marks the low point in oil and gas production, with\nmomentum accelerating in 2H17 to kick start a multi-year period of growth.\nChart 1: Hess production outlook: inflection point from 2Q17\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n-\n1Q16A 2016E 4Q17E 3Q18E 2Q19E 1Q20E 2020E 4Q21E 3Q22E\nGuyana Utica NMB Valhall Stampede\nJDA EG Other GoM Other / base Bakken\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nCritically, Hess has multiple levers to pull that reverse production declines as cash\nbecomes available from completion of NMB and Stampede.\nPlanned spending to complete NMB and Stampede is ~$700mm in 2017; with\ncompletion we expect this to drop closer to $200mm in 2018 so that before any\ncontribution from operating cash flow from these projects we expect Hess ‘apples to\napples’ capex to move lower in 2018 driving an inflection in free cash flow.\nExhibit 3: Free cash flow turns positive in 2018\n6,000\n4,000\n2,000\n-\n(2,000)\n(4,000)\nExhibit 4: with an accelerating decline in net debt\n6,000\n5,000\n4,000\n3,000\n2,000\n1,000\n4.0x\n3.5x\n3.0x\n2.5x\n2.0x\n1.5x\n1.0x\n0.5x\n(6,000)\n2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E 2019E 2020E 2021E\n-\n2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E 2019E 2020E 2021E\n0.0x\nCFO Capex Free Cash Flow\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nNet Debt\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nNet Debt / DACF\nOur assumptions include a likely project sanction of the first phase ‘early production\nsystem’ at the Liza discovery in 2Q17. However, based on discovered oil to date that we\nbelieve now easily exceeds 2bn barrels, we believe Hess is on the cusp of a multi-year\nperiod of growth that is material for a company of its size. Critically, we believe most\ncommentators have not yet included the cash flow contribution from Guyana in Hess’\nestimates given visibility that barely looks past 2018. However, with first oil now likely\n4 Hess Corp. | 11 April 2017\nin 2H19, we view final investment decision (FID) – and an exploration program that\nyields one well result every 6-8 weeks as a catalyst to rerate Hess over time.\nLiza area moving towards 2bn boe\nOperator Exxon recently confirmed the latest exploration test in Guyana 'Snoek' as the\nlatest discovery in the Liza development area, with ~82ft of net pay and in line with pre\ndrill expectations we are led to believe is in the 200-300mm boe range. Recall from our\ndiscussions with management, Snoek was characterized as a smaller but distinct target,\nupdip of Liza, but lower risk.\nThe well was drilled in 26 days to a depth of ~17,000ft in 5,128ft of water 5 miles south\nwest of Liza #1, as shown in the graphic below; the Stena Carron drill ship has now\nrelocated to the next well test, the 'Liza #4' appraisal, where we anticipate results by\nend April but with the possibility of a drill stem test in a success case that may push the\nwell result into mid-May.\nExhibit 5: Liza targeting\nExhibit 6: Exxon operated blocks in Guyana\nSource: Exxonmobil\nSource: Exxonmobil\nCritically, 'Snoek' reinforces management's prior characterization of the Stabroek block\nas moving towards a 'DHI play' meaning the risk profile of incremental exploration\nimproves - a critical factor for the next well in queue, the Payara #2 appraisal that will\nalso target a deeper test (Pacuma) scaled with a pre drill target of ~1bn boe. The next\nprospect, Liza lookalike named ‘Turbot will likely be spud around mid-year.\nFrom our discussions with Hess and the operator we summarize our understanding as\nfollows:\n• Operator XOM had previously framed the discovered potential in the Liza /\nPayara at 1.5bn – 2.0bn boe, subject to completion of two planned additional\nappraisal wells. Quoting EVP Mark Albers and CEO Darren Woods\n‘The success at Payara combined with the additional oil pay discovered with Liza-3\nbrings the total discovered resource on the block to somewhere between 1.4 billion oil\nequivalent barrels and 2 billion oil equivalent barrels.’\n’ to clarify, what we have found – not potential upside, but what we have found is 1.4\nbillion to 2 billion BOE. The upside is multi-billion barrel unrisked potential’.\nHess Corp. | 11 April 2017 5\n• Snoek and with Liza deep previously likely moves recoverable resource closer\nto the upper end of this range 2bn boe before Liza #4 and Pacuma, providing\nline of sight for at least a 4 FPSO development starting in 2019.\n• After Liza 4, the Stena Carron drillship will move back to Payara to drill an\nappraisal well which will also test a deeper prospect ‘Pacuma tail’. Where predrill\nprospect size is scaled at about 1bn boe. The next prospect (Turbot) will\nthen be spud south east of Payara. Note is that if Payara 2 is successful, this\nwould likely add another ‘boat’ with capacity of 150,000 boepd.\nThe graphics below characterize Hess view of Payara and Snoek. We assume the 1bn\nboe Pacuma prospect is the light green area below Payara.\nExhibit 7: Initial characterization of Payara\nExhibit 8: Updated characterization suggests a similar footprint to Liza\nSource: Hess\nSource: Hess\nAgain quoting ExxonMobil management:\n‘Just as we progressed rapidly at Liza, we'll move quickly to develop Payara if the\ndelineation well is successful.’\nRecall that Hess management has suggested Payara will ‘definitely be commercial’.\nHowever at this early stage we assume no value for Payara in our assessed value of\nHess’ not least as any attempt at precision is obviously premature. But with discussions\nwith management suggesting scenarios through appraisal where Payara is a lookalike to\nLiza, we believe a ‘plus three year’ development scheme is a reasonable basis to frame\noption value in a success case.\nUnder our $70 Brent base case, the theoretical NPV would be around $10/sh. This is on\ntop of the approximate $12-14/ share value we estimate is reasonable for Hess from\nthe existing Liza discovery. Note we continue to assume about 400,000 bpd gross\ndevelopment scenario–reviewed again below to reflect the latest project proposal\nsubmitted to the Guyana Government which now targets first production in 2H19.\nNote we assume negligible value for natural gas revenue in this latest iteration, thus the\nrange of $12-$14 for Liza mentioned above and $22-$24 for Liza / Payara. The table\nbelow assumes gas valued at $1 / mmcfe.\n6 Hess Corp. | 11 April 2017\nTable 1: Notional multi-phase development at Guyana: about $22/sh to Hess\nGross Barrels\n(mmboe)\nFull Project NPV\n$MM\nHess 30% Interest\nNPV\nNPV net to\nHess\n(mmboe) $mm $mm $/sh\nLiza\nEarly Production\nSystem 425 4,258 1,277 $3.9\nPhase 1 600 4,932 1,480 $4.6\nPhase 2 600 3,821 1,146 $3.5\nLiza Total 1,625 13,010 3,903 $12.0\nPayara (spec)\nEarly Production\nSystem 425 3,392 1,018 $3.1\nPhase 1 600 3,668 1,100 $3.4\nPhase 2 600 2,682 805 $2.5\nPayara spec Total 1,625 9,742 2,923 $9.0\nGuyana Total 3,250 22,753 6,826 $21.1\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates; Hess shares fully dluted 324.2mm shares after prefernce convert\nNote that at current strip oil prices of ~$55 Brent, this is closer to $14.4/sh of which\nPayara is ~$6/sh or $2.0bn. On a ‘risked’ basis, we believe this is a reasonable\ndevelopment scenario representative of any incremental discovery that resembles Liza\nrecalling that the partners have identified over 20 additional drilling prospects. On the\nassumption of a ‘plus three year’ development scenario after Liza, the potential impact\non incremental production and cash flow is significant for Hess while the cumulative\nimpact also becomes significant for XOM.\nThe charts below show our latest assessment of how a compound timeline for a Liza /\nPayara development could look, if Payara as a project does indeed prove to be a look\nalike to Liza.\nExhibit 9: Hess theoretical production profile for Liza / Payara\nExhibit 10: Hess net production profile (by phase)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nCritically, Guyana is now being described as a ‘DHI play’ meaning seismic and core have\nbeen sufficiently calibrated as to provide direct hydrocarbon indicators and hence derisking\nfuture exploration tests. This appears confirmed again by the latest ‘Snoek’\nsuccess.\nXOM’s development plan calls for an FPSO (floating production and storage offloading\nvessel) with production capacity of about 150,000 boepd for every 450mm barrels of\nrecoverable reserves, with plateau production extending up to 10 years. We suggest\nmanagement’s commentary supports gross production capacity from current discovered\nresource of at least 600,000 boepd.\nHess Corp. | 11 April 2017 7\nImpact on cash flow\nWhile the impact on production is significant, we suggest the impact on cash flow is\ntransformational for Hess. Referencing the charts below:\n• Under our base case that assumes $70 oil from 2020, we estimate operating\ncash flow net to Hess would reach over $2.5bn;\n• Net free cash flow peaks at over $2bn with a net cash outflow at any point in\nthe development of ~$300mm.\nChart 2: Hess operating cash flow contribution: Guyana ($70 base case)\n3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\nChart 3: Hess free cash flow contribution: Guyana ($70 base case)\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\n-\n-\n2017 2022 2027 2032\nLiza Early PS Liza Phase1 Liza Phase 2\nPayara Early PS Payara Phase1 Payara Phase 2\n(500)\n2017 2022 2027 2032\nLiza Early PS Liza Phase1 Liza Phase 2\nPayara Early PS Payara Phase1 Payara Phase 2\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nWhile first oil in 2019 is only the early stage of development, it is enough in our view to\nprovide visibility on multiple compression perceived absent from Hess’ investment case\ngiven its focus on short cycle development. However, after the low point in production\nin 2Q17 we suggest Hess has both – short cycle, comprising not only the Bakken but tie\nback opportunities across established infrastructure in Norway and the US GoM – and\nlong cycle in the shape of a transformational opportunity in Guyana, that becomes\ntangible with a likely FID in 2Q17.\nImpact on valuation\nIn our view, an imminent inflexion point in free cash flow comes with a step change in\nvalue recognition for Hess.

VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%\nNeutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%\nUnderperform N/A ≥ 20%\n* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend.
