And so who is \nEd Mezvinsky? \nWell, he is a former Democrat congressman who represented Iowa's \n1st congressional district in the United States House of \nRepresentatives for two terms, from 1973 to 1977. \nHe sat on the House Judiciary Committee that decided the fate of \nRichard Nixon. \nHe was outspoken saying that Nixon was a crook and a disgrace to \npolitics and the nation and should be impeached. \nHe and the Clintons were friends and very politically intertwined for \nmany years. \nEd Mezvinsky had an affair with NBC News reporter Marjorie Sue \nMargolies and later married her after his wife divorced him. \nIn 1993, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, then a freshman Democrat in \nCongress, cast the deciding vote that got President Bill Clinton's \ncontroversial tax package through the House of Representatives. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028488 \nIn March 2001, Mezvinsky was indicted and later pleaded guilty to 31 \nof 69 counts of federal criminal bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. \nEd Mezvinsky embezzled more than $10 million dollars from people \nvia both a Ponzi scheme and the notorious Nigerian e-mail scams. \nHe was found guilty and sentenced to 80 months in federal prison. \nAfter serving less than five years in federal prison, he was released in \nApril 2008 and remains on federal probation. \nTo this day, he still owes $9.4 million in restitution to his many \nvictims. \nAbout now you are saying, \"So what!\" \nWell, this is Marc and Chelsea Mezvinsky. \nThat's right; Ed Mezvinsky is Chelsea Clinton's father-in law. \nNow Marc and Chelsea are in their early thirties and purchased a $10.5 \nmillion NYC apartment. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028489 \nHas anyone heard mention of any of this in any of the media? \nIf this guy was Jenna or Barbara Bush's, or better yet, Sarah Palin's \ndaughter's father-in- law, the news would be an everyday headline and \nevery detail would be reported over and over and over. \nAnd yet liberals say there are no double standards in political \nreporting. \nAnd people are already talking about Hillary as our next \nPresident! \nAnd then there is possibly Chelsea for president in our \nfuture! \nThe cycle never ends! \nLying and corruption seem to make Democrat \ncandidates more popular. \nWAKE UP AMERICA \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028490 \nI have removed all previous addresses before sending this to you as well as sending it to you as a \"blind copy\". Please \nremove my address before forwarding. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028491 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028492 \n"
