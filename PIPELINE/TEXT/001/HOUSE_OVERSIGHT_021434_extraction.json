Police \nthought there was probable \ncause to charge him with \nunlawful sex acts with a mi-\nnor and lewd and lascivious \nmolestation. \n(m Epstein responded by \nhiring a phalanx of lawyers. \n'One of them, Harvard law \nk professor and. author Alan \nDershowitz, provided the \nI state attorney's office with \ninformation about alcohol \nel' and marijuana use by some \nof the girls who said they \n,K3 were with Epstein. \n4 Prosecutors then referred \nthe case to the grand jury \nTeenage girls were \nrecruited to visit \nEpstein for massages \nand sex, police hay. \nrather than fild charges di-\nrectly against Epstein. \nEpstein's attorneys deny \nhe had sex with underage \ngirls. The lawyers say the \ngirls' stories are not credible. \nBut if the court file is any \nindicator, they've made no ef-\nfort to depose the girls. \nNeither prosecutors nor \ndefense attorneys have \nsought to question Robson, \nsaid Dutko, her attorney.,She \nrecruited teenage girls to vis-\nit Epstein for massages and \nsexual activity, Palm Beach \npolice said, and presumably \nwould be a key witness. \nEpstein's attorney Jack \nGoldberger did not return \nphone messages. \nA source close to the case \nsuggested it is languishing \npending a decision by the \nFBI on whether to refer it to \nfederal prosecutors. \n\"We still have a pending \ncase,\" FBI spokeswoman \nJudy Orihuela said Monday. \nState Attorney Krischer \ndid not return a call for com-\nment His spokesman, Mike \nEdmondson, declined to say \nwhether federal investiga-\ntors are delaying the Epstein \ncase. But, ,he added; \"if an-\nother agency is looking at \nsomething, we wouldn't want \nto step on their toes.\" \nAttorneys say inertia in a \ncriminal case often points to \na pending plea deal. \n\"It would not surprise me \nif something has happened \nthat's not reflected in the \ncourt file,\" said Dutko, such \nas an agreement that will be \nformalized later. \nDefense attorney Marc \nShiner said defense at-\ntorneys sometimes put off \novertly conducting discov-\nery — deposing witnesses, \nrequesting documents and \nthe like — because doing so, \ncreates more work for har-\nried prosecutors who may \nbecome angry and not offer \na plea deal. . \n\"Sometimes defense law-\nyers, knowing that, will try \nand do discovery without \ntaking depositions,\" said \nShiner, a former prosecutor \nfor 13 years. - \nInstead, they may conduct \na below-the-radar probe such \nas having a private investiga-\ntor check out leads, he said. \nShiner and others say a \nplea deal for Epstein probably \nwould result in pretrial inter-\nvention, in which a defendant \nmay be ordered to undergo \na psychological evaluation, \ncounseling or .other condi-\ntions in return for dropping \nthe charge. \nEdmondson, spokesman \nfor State Attorney Krigeher, \nsaid there is no plea offer \nand no request for the pros-\necution to show its cards. \n\"To my knowledge, it's \nnever happened before on a \nfiled case,\" he said. \n@ Iarry_keiler@pbpost.com \n;Z'12 \nct) \nt4. \nt„ \nt•-4: \nzt; \nc• • \nn \n5t 8-5 42:0:7-' FD c'r ci 4% 1.•• CI) \n,Cpc1)0(7,P,,..eP-FtPa0_,V)0\" CID \n52CD g'5t45 (4.7,'5,.,(1.',F \n<.•E•o 0 0 ° fa.p., l' cc,` ni.1\\ 3') - '1'-' E. . : \n,.9, \nCD i—a 0 . ,...  r,\" \n,-.1 \ncp 0 • .40^ci Pp a.:=1.--•cp \n5 cn c-t• 'A cn 0 9 g ,-, E.

Robinson \nDeputy Director \nOffice of International Affairs \nUnited States Department of Justice \nInternational extradition is the formal process by which a person found in one country is \nsurrendered to another country for trial or punishment. The process is regulated by treaty and \nconducted between the Federal Government of the United States and the government of a foreign \ncountry. It differs considerably from interstate rendition, commonly referred to as \"interstate \nextradition\", mandated by the Constitution, Art. 4, Sec. 2. \nBelow is a listing of extradition treaties signed by the United States. As indicated, not all \nof the treaties have entered into force as of the date this document was created. \nPlease contact the Office of International Affairs, United States Department of Justice at (202) \n514-0000 to determine the status of a particular treaty. \nOver the last few years, the United States has focused its efforts on replacing extradition \ntreaties that have become outdated and obsolete, as well negotiating treaties with first time treaty \npartners. Our most recent treaties include the \"dual criminalitif approach rather than a listing of \noffenses for which extradition may be sought, clarify the procedures for provisional arrest, permit \nextradition whether the extraditable offense occurred before or after the treaty enters into force, \nallow the person sought to waive extradition, and permit temporary transfer of a fugitive serving \na sentence in one state in order to expedite prosecution in another. In our newer treaties, one of \nthe priorities of the United States has been to address two extremely difficult problems: the \nextradition of nationals; and extradition where the fugitive may be subject to the death penalty in \nthe Requesting state. Not all of our treaty partners have agreed to extradite under these \ncircumstances, but the issue is specifically addressed. \nThe treaties highlighted \"pending\" in boldface, are treaties which have not entered into \nforce as of the date of this listing. The law of extradition varies from country to country and is \nsubject to foreign policy considerations.

He was the target of \na lengthy investigation into \nhis activities with girls by the \nPalm Beach Police Depart-\nment that resulted in his in-\ndictment in July 2006 on one \ncount of felony solicitation \nof prostitution.

Herman \nalso represents a Jane \nDoe No. 2 who, like Jane Doe, claims \nEpstein summoned her to his home for \na massage when she was a minor and \nsexually touched her. \nEpstein, 55, induced several under-\nage girls to give him sexual niassages \nat his Intracoastal home, a Palm Beach \nPolice Department investigation con-\ncluded. He was indicted in. July 2006 on \na single count of felony solicitation of \nprostitution. The case is pending. \nJane Doe's parents separated two ' \nmonths after she was born at Good Sa-\nmaritan Medical Center, according to \ncourt records. The couple's subsequent \ndivorce has been contentious. Each has \nhad primary custody of the girl at various \ntimes. \nThe father pleaded guilty to. fed-\neral fraud charges in 2001 and was sen-\ntenced to 21 months in federal prison, \nplus three years probation.

Those \ncases remain active. \nAlso pending against Epstein in state court \nis a felony charge of solicitation of prostitu-\ntion arising from the same alleged incidents \nwith several girls. That case is set for' trial in \nJuly, two years, after he was indicted. \n° Jane Doe's new lawsuit, filed in Palm Beach \nCounty Circuit Court, is the most explicit in \ndetailing Epstein's alleged misconduct. It is \nthe only suit to include Robson and Kellen \nas defendants, and the only one to make con-\nspiracy and racketeering allegations. \nJane Doe will turn 18 in May.

After serving \n18 months in jail, he will be \nunder house arrest for a year. \nAnd he ,will have a lifelong \nobligation to register as a sex \noffender. He must submit to \nan HIV test within 48 hours, \nwith the results being pro-\nvided to his victims or their \nparents. \nAs part of the plea deal, \nfederal investigators agreed \nto drop their investigation \nof Epsteih, Which they had \ntaken to a grand jury, two law \nenforcement sources said. \n.

At least one woman \nhas sued him in New York, \nwhere he owns a 51,000-\nsquare-foot Manhattan man-\nsion. \n\"It's validation of what \nwe're saying in the civil \ncases,\" said Miami attorney \nJeffrey Herman, who repre-\nsents the alleged victims in \nthe federal lawsuits. West \nPalm Beach attorney Ted \nLeopold represents one al-\nleged victim in a civil suit in \nstate court. He said he antici-\npates amending that lawsuit \nto add \"a few other clients\" \nas well. \nIn the criminal case, po-\nlice went so far as to scour \nEpstein's trash and conduct \nsurveillance at Palm Beach \nInternational Airport, where \nthey watched for his private \njet so they would know when \nhe was in town. They con-\ncluded that Epstein paid girls \n$200 to $300 each after the \nmassage sessions. \n\"I'm like a Heidi Fleiss,\" \nHaley Robson, now 22, told \npolice about her efforts in \nrecruiting girls for Epstein. \nThere was probable cause \nto chaise Epstein with un-\nlawful sex acts with .a minor \nand lewd and lascivious mo-\nlestation, police concluded. \nThe state attorney's of-\nfice said questions about \nthe girls' credibility led it to \ntake the unprecedented step \nof presenting the evidence \nagainst Epstein to a grand \njury rather than directly \ncharging him. \nPalm Beach Police Chief \nMichael Reiter was furious \nwith State Attorney Barry \nKrischer, saying in a May \n2006 letter that the prosecu-\ntor should disqualify himself. \n\"I continue to find your \noffice's treatment of these \ncases highly unusual,\" he \nwrote. He then asked for and \ngot a federal investigation. \nEpstein hired a phalanx of \nhigh-priced lawyers — includ-\ning Harvard law professor \nand author Alan Dershowitz \n— and public relations people \nwho questioned Reiter's com-\npetence and the victims' \ntruthfulness. \nIn addition to mansions \nin Palm Beach and Manhat-\ntan, Epstein owns homes in \nNew Mexico and the Virgin \nIslands. He's a frequent con-\ntributor to Democratic Party \ncandidates. He also donated \n$30 million to Harvard in \n2003. \nFormer New York Gov. \nEliot Spitzer returned a \n$50,000 campaign contribu-\ntion from Epstein after his \nindictment, then resigned \nthis year during his own sex \nscandal. And the same Palm \nBeach Police Department \nthat vigorously investigated \nEpstein returned his $90,000 \ndonation for the purchase of \na firearms simulator. \nStaff writer Eliot Kleinberg and \nstaff researcher Michelle Quig-\nley contributed to this story. \nlarry_keller@pbpost.com \n\f+ \n8A THE PALM BEACH POST • TUESOAY, JULY 1, 2008 \nUMA SANGHVVStaff Photographer \nJeffrey Epstein. (left) appears in court Monday. Soon after he was charged two years ago, Epstein reject-\ned a deal that would have given him five years' probation and no criminal record, documents show. \n\fFD-350 (Rev. 5-8-81) \n(Indicate page, name of \nnewspaper, city and state.) \n(Mount Clipping in Space Below) \nDate: 07072008 \nEdition: Palm Beach Post \nRich man fought the law \nand he mostly won \nTwo years after a grand jury \nindicted him on a felony charge of \nsolicitation of prostitution, Jeffrey \nEpstein finally admitted that he \nlured a teenage girl to his $8.5 mil-\nlion, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach \nmansion for sex. A week ago, the \n.55-year-old investment banker be-\ngan serVing 18 months in jail. \nBut that plea deal — guilty of \nfelony solicitation of prostitution \nand procuring a person under the \nage of 18 for prostitution — does \nnot account for all five of the girls, \none as young as 14, who alleged that \n\" Epstein sexually abused them. And \nwhy is Epstein serving his \nterm in the overcrowded \nPalm Beach County Jail \nand not a state prison, \nwhere inmates are sent if \ntheir sentences are longer \nthan one year? \nThe slow, dissatisfy-\ning resolution of the case \nsends a message to the \npublic that there's a dif-\nferent system of justice for \nthe wealthy who hire high-powered \nlawyers. Epstein's legal team includ-\ned West Palm Beach defense attor-\nney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law \nSchool Professor Alan Dershowitz, \nwho defended 0.J. Simpson against \nmurder charges, and Kenneth \nStarr, the prosecutor who pursued \nthen-President Bill Clinton for lying \nabout sex with young women. \nPalm Beach police spent 11 \nmonths investigating Epstein be-\nfore State Attorney Barry Krischer \nsent the case to a grand jury in-\nstead of charging Epstein so the \nman who once boasted of accepting \nc;nly billionaire clients could face a \ntrial. The police had taken a high \nschool transcript, class schedules \nand phone messages from Epstein's \nWhy is Jeffrey Epstein in \njail, and not prison? \nhome that showed he knew the girls \nwere underage. Yet Mr. Krischer \nwas more swayed by Epstein 's law-\nyers, who attempted to impugn the \ngirls' character by showing they \nhad chatted on myspace.com about \nsmoking marijuana and drinking. \nHe should have let a jury decide \nwhether the victims — and Epstein \n— were credible. \nUltimately, one charge against \nEpstein finally reflected \nthe age of one victim, and \nthe plea agreement left \nEpstein labeled a sex of-\nfender. With that additional \ncharge, if Epstein had been \nconvicted at a trial, he \ncould have been sentenced \nto anything from probation \nto 15 years in prison, Assis-\ntant State Attorney Lanna \nBelohlavek said, adding that the \nrecommended guideline sentence \nwas 21 months. \nEpstein also won't have to cer-\ntify to the court that he is receiv-\ning counseling, typically required \nof sex offenders, because he has \na private psychiatrist But without \ncourt supervision, who will ensure \nEpstein is in fact being treated? \nThe plea deal also drops a federal \ninvestigation of Epstein. If a federal \ninvestigation was warranted, how \ndoes dropping it before completion \nbenefit the public? \nEpstein preyed on girls and de-\nnied it. For three years, his wealth \nand the influence of his lawyers \nbought him the protection the state \nattorney owed to the victims. \nTitle: Rich man fought the law and he mostly won \nCharacter: \nor \nClassification: 31E-MM-108062 \nSubmitting Office: Miami (PB2) \nIndexing: \n/6-- Pt /6 b \n\fTHREE WOMEN SUING BILLIONAIRE JEFFREY EPSTEIN FOR SEX ABUSE WANT PLE...
