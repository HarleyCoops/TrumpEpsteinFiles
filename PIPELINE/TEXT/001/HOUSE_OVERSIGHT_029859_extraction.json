(Uma Sanghvi / The Palm Beach Post) \nPalm Beach Post Staff Writer \nHide caption \nJeffrey Epstein \nPalm Beach Post Staff Writer \nHide caption \nAttorney Brad Edwards \nPalm Beach Post Staff Writer \nHide caption \nAttorney Jack Scarola \nPalm Beach Post Staff Writer \nBy \nPosted Oct 3, 2017 at 12:01 AM Updated Oct 4, 2017 at 12:46 AM \nEnding years of speculation about how much Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein  \npaid young women who claimed he used them as sex toys, court documents filed last \nweek show he shelled out $5.5 million to settle lawsuits with three of more than two \ndozen teens who sued him. \nResponding to requests from Epstein's attorneys in a complex lawsuit that was \nspawned by the sex scandal, attorney Bradley Edwards said the politically-\nconnected 64-year-old convicted sex offender paid more than $1 million to each of \nthe three women Edwards represented. \nIdentified in court papers only by their initials or pseudonyms because of the nature \nof the allegations and their youthful ages, L.M. was paid $1 million, E.W. $2 million \nand Jane Doe $2.5 million, Edwards said of the settlements he negotiated with \nEpstein to end the lawsuits. \nJack Goldberger, one of Epstein's criminal defense attorneys, on Tuesday declined \ncomment on the revelations, citing confidentiality agreements that were part of the \nsettlements. For the same reason, he declined to say whether Epstein paid similar \namounts to settle roughly two dozen lawsuits filed by other young women against \nEpstein, claiming he paid them for sex when some were as young as 14 years old. \nAttorney Jack Scarola, who is representing Edwards, said his client was compelled \nto divulge the confidential settlements to answer questions posed by Epstein's \nattorneys. \"Brilliant move on their part,\" he said. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029860 \nEven if Epstein's attorneys hadn't opened the door, Scarola said the information \nwould have likely come out. He says the information will help him undermine \nEpstein's claims that Edwards \"ginned up\" the allegations to help his former law \npartner, imprisoned and disbarred Fort Lauderdale lawyer Scott Rothstein, \nperpetuate a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. \nThe revelations of the settlements came as part of an ongoing lawsuit that started as \na dispute between Epstein and Rothstein, both billionaires. \nA year after Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and \nprocuring a minor for prostitution, he sued Rothstein and Edwards, claiming they \ntrumped up the allegations of sexual molestation to perpetuate the Ponzi scheme. \nRothstein was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 2010 after admitting he had built \nhis wildly successful law firm by forging the names of federal judges and others to \npersuade investors he had negotiated settlements in lawsuits against high-profile \npeople. Investors were told they could get a cut of the cash. \nOne of the high-profile people Rothstein used to lure investors was Epstein, \naccording to a lawsuit West Palm Beach attorney Robert Critton filed on Epstein's \nbehalf. According to the lawsuit, Rothstein told investors Epstein, a money \nmanager, had agreed to settle the lawsuits with the teens for 8200 million — a claim \nCritton described as \"a complete fabrication.\" \nAfter Epstein dropped the lawsuit in 2012, Edwards turned the tables on him. \nEdwards accused Epstein of filing the lawsuit maliciously to punish him for \nrepresenting the young women. Although Edwards was a partner in Rothstein's now \ndefunct firm, Scarola claims Epstein had no evidence Edwards was involved in the \nPonzi scheme. Federal prosecutors successfully charged other attorneys and \nmembers of the firm, but Edwards was never implicated, Scarola said in the \nmalicious prosecution lawsuit. \nThe revelations about the money Epstein paid to three of the young woman came \nlast week in documents filed for a hearing Tuesday in preparation for a December \ntrial on the lawsuit. \nAttorney Tonja Haddad Coleman, who represents Epstein, on Tuesday sought a \ndelay of the trial, in part, because she claimed she has been unable to talk to her \nclient since his estate on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands was devastated \nlast month by Hurricane Irma. \"I've had no ability to communicate with Mr. \nEpstein,\" she said. \nPointing out Epstein's enormous wealth and his private jet, Palm Beach County \nCircuit Judge Donald Hafele rejected her request. While saying he didn't want to \nappear insensitive to those victimized by the storm that hammered the Caribbean \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029861 \nand roared through South Florida, he said Coleman offered no proof, such as an \naffidavit from Epstein, to shore up her claims. \nStill, Hafele gave Coleman extra time to respond to various motions that he will have \nto decide before the case goes to trial. \nDespite Scarola's insistence that Edwards had nothing to do with Rothstein's Ponzi \nscheme, Coleman said the evidence indicates otherwise. Why else would he try to \ndepose Epstein's well-known friends, such as now President Donald Trump, former \nPresident Bill Clinton and illusionist David Copperfield, she asked. He used the \ncelebrities as a draw, she said. \n\"The Epstein cases were used to fleece money and defraud investors,\" she said. \nEdward's malicious prosecution case has been difficult for both sides because both \nEpstein and Edwards have refused to answer questions. As he did in the civil \nlawsuits, Epstein has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination \nwhen questioned by Scarola. Edwards has claimed that much of the information \nEpstein is seeking is protected by attorney-client privilege. \nThe malicious prosecution lawsuit is one of two hotly-contested lawsuits that \ncontinue to pit Edwards against Epstein. Edwards also is suing the U.S. attorney's \noffice, claiming it violated the federal Crime Victims Rights Act when it negotiated a \nnon-prosecution agreement with Epstein. \nOnly after federal prosecutors agreed to drop their investigation of Epstein, did he \nagree to plead guilty to two prostitution charges in Palm Beach County Circuit \nCourt. In federal court records, prosecutors claim one of the key reasons they agreed \nto drop their case was Epstein's agreement to settle lawsuits filed against him by \ndozens of his underage victims. \nSign up for daily e-mail  \nWake up to the day's top news, delivered to your inbox \nSponsored Content \nTrending topics for Baby Boomers \nBy The Palm Beach Post \nRead the latest news specific to the Baby Boomer Generation on health, retirement, \nfinances, and much more... \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029862 \nRead more  \nMost Popular Stories \nMost Popular Stories \nDid rare stolen coins end up in supermarket change \nmachine?
