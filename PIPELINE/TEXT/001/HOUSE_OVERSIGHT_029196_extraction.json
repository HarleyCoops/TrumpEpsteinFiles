It is Oct 19th. I was previously invited to give \na major lecture in Heidelberg Oct 14 but they had to cancel it after the university determination re australia \nwas publicized by the bitch. That air ticket, which they had paid fo, was about 5250 euros. There is a $900 \ncancellation fee, and they have agreed to let me keep the ticket if I pay them 4500 euros. I offered that to the \nother place but they only have $5K USD total, which includes the $4K fee they originally offered me. I am \ngoing to check other tickets now, but wanted to know if you might be flying to europe around then and could \ntake a hitchhiker. :) \nLawrence M.

Now I simply do not have the flexibility to decide so easily \non amounts in „kilos\". (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before \ndeadline agreed to come and implied a pretty large sum). \nWhat I can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment. \nI deeply regret these limitations but I cannot ignore redlines. \nSo please let me know if you can or cannot come. \nAs ever Jakob \nJakob J.

The Gottingen event had to be cancelled so that means I now do not have an air ticket to Germany. I \nam going to check whether I can arrange anything in the Uk which might cover part of the cost for a new ticket. In the meantime I \nthought I should let you know and ask whether it is possible to cover part or all of the cost for a ticket. \nLawrence. \nLawrence M.
