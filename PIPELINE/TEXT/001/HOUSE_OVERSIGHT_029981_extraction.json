Last night we confirmed a studio recording with an stunning soprano to record a new aria Fred wrote. Its \nearly 7:30-9pm on April 4. F really wants to see you, so is after that too late? Wanna join us somewhere to eat \nafter? Wanna come to the studio? Fred will be playing the piano for the demo. Otherwise, we could have a \nvisit anytime you want after the 4th. But if you can, the studio would be fun and I would love to have your \ninput in the booth:). Tora and Miasha might come too. Its an awesome aria sung by a Vampiress who looks \njust like (better) Vanessa Williams from our day. ( The Miss USA that somehow had some haha nudie photos \nfloating around). ANYWAY. .what do ya think? \nSent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
