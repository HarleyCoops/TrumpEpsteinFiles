He instead took the strong action of dressing down U.S. Steel by name. As Richard \nReeves writes in his book \"President Kennedy,\" reporters were left \"literally gasping.\" The young president \ncalled out big steel for threatening \"economic recovery and stability\" while Americans risked their lives in \nSoutheast Asia. J.F.K. threatened to sic his brother's Justice Department on corporate records and then held \nfirm as his opponents likened his flex of muscle to the power grabs of Hitler and Mussolini. (Sound familiar?) \nU.S. Steel capitulated in two days. The Times soon reported on its front page that Kennedy was at \"a high point \nin popular support.\" \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
