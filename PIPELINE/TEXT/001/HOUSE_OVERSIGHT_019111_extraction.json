For one thing, he was wearing \nslippers. Expensive, embroidered, monogrammed slippers. But \nslippers all the same. \nFor another, he was accompanied by two attractive women. \nEven in Manhattan, an island that attracts beautiful women from \nall over the world, these women stood out. \nAs the man half shuffled, half walked down the avenue, the \nwomen walked slightly behind him, as if they were attendants or \nstaff. \nTim followed, keeping a respectable distance, as the three-\nsome made a right onto 71st Street and headed toward an enor-\nmous town house— a house that was almost a fortress—right \nvii \n\fAUTHOR'S NOTE \nin the middle of the block. The imposing residence had a stone \nfacade and a fifteen-foot-high front door that wouldn't have \nlooked out of place protecting a castle. And, like our neighbor's \nslippers, the house had a monogram: raised brass letters that \nspelled out JE. \nThe house and, quite possibly, the two women belonged to \nJeffrey Epstein, a rich and powerful man who was also a regis-\ntered sex offender with a strong taste for underage women. \nNot just sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds. But younger girls \nas well. \nEpstein was alleged to have abused dozens of young women, \nor, more accurately, girls. He'd settled potential lawsuits with \nsome of them. He'd done a bit of prison time for his crimes. A bit \nof time. And now here he was, out in the world again. \nAccompanied by two beautiful young women. \nI had been hearing hair-raising stories about Jeffrey Epstein for a \ncouple of years. Our interests could not have been more differ-\nent, but Palm Beach, where we both live, is small and tightly \nknit, and we knew some of the same people. \nEpstein's arrest had made headlines in papers all over the \nworld. But in Palm Beach, it caused a scandal that continues to \nset off aftershocks and leave a bad smell. \nSo I had followed Epstein's case in the media and talked \nabout it over dinners with friends. I wondered why it had taken \nso long for the Palm Beach police to catch up with Epstein. And, \nonce they did, why he had served so little jail time. \nThose were the obvious questions, but there were others: \nHow had Epstein made his money, possibly billions?

And while the news media had some details \nabout the underage girls, reporters seemed only to know what \nhad happened at the moment of his arrest. \nEpstein definitely liked his massages. He got them from two, \neven three, young women a day, right in his mansion on the \nisland. He'd been operating on an almost industrial scale. But \nwho were these girls? Where had they come from? How did they \nfind their way to his home on a secluded street in Palm Beach? \nEpstein had powerful friends. He'd flown Bill Clinton around \nin his private jet and rubbed shoulders with heads of state, Nobel \nPrize winners, any number of billionaires. Prince Andrew, the \nman sixth in line to the British throne, had been a close friend. \nWere any of these connections the reason that Epstein was \nnow a free man? \nI wanted to know. After all, our homes were a half mile apart, \nand Epstein's actions had had an undeniable impact on the town \nwhere I lived. Stirred by that sighting of Epstein up in New York, \nTim Malloy and I began to investigate. \nWe partnered with John Connolly, a tough, no-nonsense \njournalist who had once been a cop with the NYPD and had been \nfollowing the Epstein story for close to ten years. \nWorking together, we interviewed Epstein's friends, going all \nthe way back to his childhood; we met with Epstein's acquain-\ntances, employees, neighbors, and business associates, and finally \nwith the families of his victims. We interviewed law enforce-\nment officers who'd worked on the investigation in Palm Beach \nand lawyers on all sides of the resulting court cases, some of \nwhich are still working their way through the court system. \nCombining our interview material with evidence obtained \nfrom court filings and other investigations, such as the one \nix \n\fAUTHOR'S NOTE \nconducted by Connolly's Vanity Fair colleague Vicky Ward, we \nbegan to put the pieces together. \nIn a few instances, we have re-created brief scenes and \nsnatches of dialogue. These are based on interviews, police \ninvestigation documents, and court filings. We changed the \nnames and identities of the girls, hoping to protect them from \nmore embarrassment and harm. \nThere never was any doubt that Jeffrey Epstein was guilty. He \nadmitted as much in the non-prosecution agreement he agreed \nto sign in 2007. The question is, what exactly was he guilty of? \nThis book attempts to answer that question and many others \nabout this strange and mysterious man. These days people all \naround the world are angry about and suspicious of the super \nrich and powerful. The story of Jeffrey Epstein is an object lesson \nabout why we ought to be. To put it simply, some people think \nthey can operate outside the law. And that's what they do. \n—James Patterson, Palm Beach, February 20, 2016 \nx \n\fNOT E \n'air colleague Vicky Ward, we \n: re-created brief scenes and \nbased on interviews, police \n)urt filings.

But Mary's a teenager now. Fourteen years old. \nShe even has a boyfriend. He's cute and popular. Joe' is the heart-\nthrob of her school, and Mary's feelings for him are new to her, \npowerful, hard to untangle. She's thinking of Joe as she presses \nthe Play button on her iPod. \nThe MP3 player's on shuffle.

She's twirling around and \naround, flinging her arms out to grab the clothes hanging up in \nher closet—it's like embracing ten thousand fans! Then she stops \nand pulls out the earbuds. Suddenly she's become fourteen again. \nJust a girl, jittery, nervous. \nWhat she's thinking about now is what she will wear to the \nbig fancy house. \nMary desperately wants to make an impression. This will be her \nfirst trip to the house. She does not want to look like a child on \nthis outing. \nShe picks out a pair of skinny white jeans, puts on a freshly \nwashed halter top that leaves her flat stomach bare. The cross \nthat Joe gave her last Christmas hangs from her neck. \nThink of the money, she thinks. \nFor Mary, it's incredible money. Several weeks' wages at \nMickey D's. And just for giving some old man a massage? She \ntwists the earbuds back in, dives into the closet, sings along with \nBritney Spears: \nDon't you know that you're toxic? \nThe tight white jeans fit Mary perfectly.

But out in the sticks, where Mary lives, \nyou get Barbies —passed down from mother to daughter, from \nsister to sister. They're rail-thin, missile-breasted. There's a touch \nof knowingness to the curl of their otherwise innocent mouths. \nAmerican Girl dolls are girlie, but Barbie's like Britney Spears. \nBarbie's dangling her long legs over the line that separates girls \nfrom women. \nBe like Barbie, Mary thinks. \nShe can't be nervous. Not now. Not today. \nWhat she tells herself, over and over again, is: It's not that big \na deal. \nBut, of course, it is a big deal. Before long, Mary's visit to the \nbig fancy house will become part of a months-long Palm Beach \npolice investigation—an affidavit for probable cause, filed by \nthe Palm Beach PD — and, finally, the arrest and conviction of \nthe home's owner, Jeffrey Epstein. \n5 \n\fCHAPTER 2 \nJeffrey Epstein: February 2005 \nJeffrey's morning routine is precise and unvarying. First he \nspends twenty-five minutes in silence, visualizing the day \nahead as he digests the guava, banana, and Mileslix that his \nchef prepares for him— the same way every day—at six in the \nmorning. Then Jeffrey walks a third of a mile up to South County \nRoad, pausing once in a while to take deep, restorative breaths. \nIt's a slight slope that leads toward the ocean. Jeffrey's home \non the Intracoastal Waterway is behind him now. The morning's \nnot windy. The Atlantic is calm and glittery, and fishing trawlers \nbob gently on distant waves. \nJeffrey's partial to monogrammed sweatpants, monogrammed \nfleece pullovers, and hoodies. Casual attire offset by embroi-\ndered Stubbs & Wootton slippers— the kind that sell for hun-\ndreds of dollars a pair. His hair, which is thick, has turned silver. \nBut Jeffrey Epstein does not have a paunch.

For a fifty-two-year-old \nman, he's extremely fit. Six feet tall, 180 pounds, brown eyes, a \nstrong jawline. \nHe's never been a drinker. He doesn't smoke or take drugs, \nand he takes care good care of his body as well as his mind. \nIt's a magnificent mind. His gift is for numbers: complex calcu-\nlations, abstract formulas. Even as a child, Jeffrey could untangle \nmath problems that would stump most smart adults. Numbers just \nfall into place for him, forming in ranks he can bend, twist, \nmanipulate—and multiply. He could have been a scientist or a \nmathematician. As a young man, he taught calculus and physics. \nThen he became an investor—a very rich man. Then he became a \nphilanthropist, like Bill Gates. His love for science has inspired him \nto give millions to academics and institutions committed to study-\ning mysteries of the brain and the arcana of physics. He's given mil-\nlions to Harvard. And he's given money to politicians: Governor \nEliot Spitzer, of New York, and Governor Bill Richardson, of New \nMexico, where Epstein owns the largest home in the state. \nEpstein's flown Bill Clinton to Africa on a private jet—not \nthe Gulfstream he owns but his Boeing 727, customized with its \nown trading floor —so that the former president could promote \nhis various and worthy causes. \nJust for fun, Chris Tucker, the comedian, and Clinton's pal \nKevin Spacey had tagged along for the ride. \n\"Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed \nphilanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an \nin-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science,\" Clinton \nwould say through a spokesperson. \"I especially appreciated his \ninsights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work \non democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and \ncombating HIV/AIDS.\" \n7 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nBut is Jeffrey thinking about that trip now? \nHis first guest is due that morning at nine, and that leaves \nhim enough time for a shower, a lunch, and a few phone calls \nbefore the second girl arrives. \nSarah has scheduled that girl for one. \nFor Jeffrey, it's just part of the daily routine. \nBut on this day, there's a delicious twist. \nOne of the girls is a first-timer. \nMary: February 200.f \nD ownstairs, the dc \ngruffly: \n\"Ella estd aqui \n\"She's here.

Mary's father shouts, \ngruffly: \n\"Ella estci aqui. Su amiga con el camiOn.\" \n\"She's here. Your friend with the truck.\" \nMary runs down the stairs. It's game day, and Dad's already \ngot the TV on. Her stepmom's out running errands. Mary's twin \nsister has gone out, too, Rollerblading with a few of her friends. \n\"Going *shopping,\" she yells, and she pops a piece of Dubble \nBubble into her mouth. \n`2Dice quien?\" \n\"Says who?\" \nMary's already halfway out the door. Her father calls out \nagain, but on Sundays there's no getting him out of his chair. \nBesides, Mary knows he'll be happy when he sees the money \nshe's made. Real money, like Joe's cousin Wendy Dobbs, is \n9 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nmaking.* And it's not like she's running off to do something \ncrazy. After all, Wendy's assured her already that there's nothing \nto worry about. \nMary's father is Cuban—an immigrant—a self-made man who \nruns a contracting business. He's wise to the ways of the world \nand highly protective of his two daughters. They're good girls, he \nknows. Almost angels. As far as he knows, they don't drink. \nThey've never tried drugs. They love clothes and, especially, \nmusic —Britney Spears, Nelly Furtado, Maroon 5, the boy band \nwith that dreamy lead singer. Mary loves California, which she's \nnever seen but daydreams about. She just knows she'll live there \nsomeday—a plan that's okay with her father as long as Mary \nkeeps up with her homework and chores. \nWhat he worries about, in the meantime, is the crowd that \nMary runs with. \nJoe is a fine boy. More responsible than most American boys \nhis age. But Joe's cousin, Wendy, is another story. Mary's father \ndoesn't like Wendy at all and would have liked her even less had \nhe known about Wendy's intentions. \nIn just one hour, Wendy's told Mary, she can make more \nmoney than her father makes in a day: \"This guy in Palm Beach. \nHe's rich.

There's so much \nthat she wants to do and see. But for her the Gold Coast, twenty \nmiles away, might as well be another country. \n\"Yes,\" she had said, without even thinking about it. \nThen there was Joe to contend with. \n\"Who is this guy?\" Joe had said, shaking his head. \"You don't \nknow a thing about him.\" \n\"Hundreds of dollars,\" Mary had whispered. She couldn't \nquite look at Joe, but she was firm: \"I can make that in one hour\" \nJoe seemed to think they were actually talking about it. A \nconversation—some back-and-forth. But the thought of not going \nhadn't even crossed Mary's mind. If anything, she hoped that it \nwould become a regular thing. \n\"To rub his feet? Are you kidding?

Or mine?\" \n\"You'd never see me again.\" \nMary felt bad as she said it. She felt bad for lying. \nShe knew that it would be more than a foot rub. \nWendy had told her that much, at least. \n11 \n\fCHAPTER 4 \nJeffrey Epstein: February 2005 \nJohn Kluge, the media magnate, has bought up several lots \naround here, torn down the mansions, and built a grand, \nsprawling estate. But Epstein's neighbors have blocked his \nown efforts to buy more land and increase his holdings. \nEpstein's address in Palm Beach is 358 El Brillo Way. Built in \nthe fifties by a totally run-of-the-mill architect, the house has \nnone of the elegance of his neighbors' homes. It's big, with a big \nswimming pool—that's the most you can say for it. It's totally \nbland. But it's the last house on a dead-end block, the last block \nof the street, and this makes it very secluded. \nTonight, one of Epstein's black Escalades will whisk him \naway, taking him to the private terminal at Palm Beach Interna-\ntional Airport. Then a short flight down to Little Saint James — \nor, as he likes to call it, Little Saint Jeff's—the seventy-eight-acre \nisland he owns in the Virgin Islands.

Business and pleasure — \nalthough, in Epstein's experience, the two have always fit together \nnicely. \nHe strolls through the gate, past the guard, up to the side \ndoor that leads to the kitchen. Inside, he ignores the maid doing \ndishes and climbs a wide, winding staircase to the second floor. \nHe walks down a hallway, one that's lined with photographs of \nnaked women. Then, in his bedroom, he opens a closet. Inside, \nthere are many more photographs. Erotic photos, tacked to the \nwall, of girls who have come to the house. \nFamiliar faces, familiar bodies. That's what makes the \nfirst-timers so special. \nEpstein checks his watch before closing the door. \nThe Virgin Islands can wait. \n13 \n\fCHAPTER 5 \nMary: February 2005 \nThe Dubble Bubble's lost all its flavor, but Mary's still chew-\ning the gum as she shifts, nervously, in the backseat of \nWendy's big pickup truck. The girl sitting up front next \nto Wendy is a stranger to Mary. She's chain-smoking menthols. \nThe music is blaring; the seat is filthy and gross. Worried that \nher white jeans will get grody, Mary sits on her hands. Then, \nthrough the window, she sees a gigantic resort called the Break-\ners. It is resplendent, sun-drenched, not quite real—like some-\nthing you'd see in the movies. \nIt makes for an interesting contrast. \n\"We'll wait for her,\" Wendy says to the girl in the passenger \nseat. \"Then we can all go to the mall.\" \n\"Which one?\" \n\"The Gardens.\" \nIt's like she's not there.

Wen-\ndy's always seemed so much cooler than kids Mary's age. This \nother girl's just a mystery. And when Wendy does turn around to \nspeak to Mary, her stare seems to slice right through the younger \ngirl. \n\"Remember,\" Wendy says, according to a probable cause affi-\ndavit filed by the Palm Beach police. \"When he asks how old you \nare, say eighteen.\" \nThe light changes, and Wendy turns back around but keeps \nlooking at Mary in the rearview mirror. \n\"Got it?\" \nMary nods. \n\"I mean it,\" says Wendy. \nWho would believe her? Anyone can see that Mary is younger \nthan that. \n\"Okay,\" she says. \"I got it.

Once \nmore, she says: \"When the man asks your age, say eighteen.\" \nMary nods again and smiles, slightly. She wants Wendy to \nsee her smiling. To know that she's got it all under control. But \nWendy's eyes are on the front gate now. It opens, she parks, and \nthey walk past a guard. \n15 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \n\"We're here to see Jeff,\" says Wendy. \nThe guard nods—of course you are—and leads them to the \nside door. \nThey're in the kitchen now. Mary, Wendy, some middle-aged \nman. The man has a long face, bushy eyebrows, and thick silver \nhair—and he's fit. As fit as the jocks that Mary goes to school \nwith. Not attractive, exactly. He's way too old for that. But confi-\ndent, in a way that makes an impression. \nStanding behind the man there's a woman. She's blond, very \npretty, much taller than Wendy. \nWhat a strange scene, Mary thinks. She can't shake the feeling \nthat the man is studying her. Then he nods, and he and Wendy \nwalk out of the kitchen. A little while later, they're back. \n\"Sarah,\" the man says to the tall woman. \"You can take Mary \nupstairs.\" \nSarah takes Mary up a wide winding staircase carpeted in pink. \nTogether they walk down a hall that's got photographs on the \nwall—naked women. Long curtains cover windows and don't \nlet in much light. In the air, there's a strong lavender fragrance. \nThen they come to a room containing a green-and-pink sofa. \nThere's a large bathroom off to one side and doors on either side \nof the sofa. There's a wooden armoire with sex toys on it. There's \na massage table, too, and a mural of a naked woman. \n\"Wait here,\" says Sarah. \"Jeff will be up in a moment.\" \nMary's too freaked out to do anything else.

And what she's doing is shocking: pulling her underwear \noff to the side. Flashing one of her tiny apple-round butt cheeks \ntoward the camera. \nMary gasps. She turns around. And there's Epstein standing \nin front of her, wearing nothing but a towel. \n17 \n\fCHAPTER 6 \nMichael Reiter: March 2005 \nChief Reiter looks more like a bank president than a cop. \nHe's well built, with an air of formality and discretion. But \nhe's got twenty-four years on the job. Decades earlier, he \nwas a campus police officer in Pittsburgh. Then he rose, steadily, \nthrough the ranks in Palm Beach, moving up from patrol officer \nto detective, working vice, narcotics, and organized crime, then \nbecoming a sergeant, captain, major, and assistant chief—a job \nhe held for three years—before becoming chief of police. Reiter \nis what you'd call seasoned, although chief of police in Palm \nBeach is a job that calls upon his political skills as much as his \nstreet smarts. \nThen again, from time to time, things do happen. \nOnce in a blue moon there are murders— though these are \nso rare that they tend to be remembered for decades. \nSometimes there are hurricanes to contend with, and, when the \n18 \nsea calms, human cargo \nfickers aim the bows of th( \norder their passengers to \nMost of the passengers \nwho stake all they have cm \nto time, Palm Beach cops I \nThings get busier dur \nit, the season.

From time \nto time, Palm Beach cops have to retrieve their bodies from the surf. \nThings get busier during the wintertime, or, as the locals call \nit, the season. It's when the very rich come to town, throw par-\nties and balls, shop, and tangle traffic at the intersections around \nWorth Avenue. The population booms, and the men and women \nwho work under Chief Reiter deal with fender benders, shoplift-\ners, and snotty skateboarding teenagers. There are DUIs. Domes-\ntic disturbances. Choking victims and heart attacks. It's routine \nstuff, but there's always lots of it. Enough to keep the men and \nwomen who work for Reiter busy. \nChief Reiter's proud of the team he has built. And, the team \nknows, they're lucky to have him. Reiter's extremely well qualified \nfor the job. If anything, he's overqualified, with a certificate from \nthe John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and anti-\nterrorist training at Quantico, courtesy of the FBI. It's not brought \nup often at cocktail parties in Palm Beach, but several of the 9/11 \nhijackers lived in Palm Beach County. They took flight lessons at \nlocal airstrips. A few, including the mastermind, Mohamed Atta, \nhad been regulars at 251 Sunrise, a chic nightclub in Palm Beach. \nThere they had regaled any woman who would listen with \nmade-up stories about their adventures as pilots. \nBut 251 Sunrise is shuttered now. The joint was shut down in \n2004, after an avalanche of noise complaints. For the moment, Palm \nBeach is as quiet and calm as any place Reiter has dreamed about. \nFor the moment. \n19 \n\fCHAPTER 7 \nMary: March 2005 \nJ\nf there's no traffic, Mary's hometown is less than thirty min-\nutes away from the island of Palm Beach. But in economic \nterms it's a world away. Her high school is run by the county. \nMost of Mary's classmates are black. Thirty percent are Hispanic, \nas she is. The rest are white. The school has a C rating, and lots \nof students receive free or discounted lunches. Mary is one of \nthose students. But inch by inch, she's working her way out of \nthe crab barrel. A good kid, her teachers think. A kid with a \nfuture in front of her. \nWeeks have gone by since her meeting with Epstein. She \nhasn't told anyone about the visit. Still, other kids at the high \nschool have noticed a change. \n\"Yo, Mary,\" a friend says. \"What's up with you anyway?\" \nThis is a kid who veers from nice to mean, depending on \nwho else is around. \nStill, a friend. \n\"Nothing,\" says Mary. \n\"You got your period? \n\"Shut the fuck up,\" M; \nThere have been rui \nRumors started by a girl v \n\"Whore,\" her rival shc \n\"You're the whore,\" M; \nMary rushes the girl, vv \ntwisting and tugging.

Someone yells, \"Catfight!\" By the time the \nbell rings for next period, Mary's sitting in the principal's office. \nShe shakes her head in reply to the questions, stays silent, \nfeeling humiliated. \nThen, in her wallet, they find the three hundred dollars. \nMary's too young and too small to be stripping. Besides, the bills \nare all twenties, not singles or fives. When they call Mary's par-\nents, her teachers suggest a more obvious explanation: Does \nMary do drugs or deal them? \nMary's father knows better than that. \"No,\" he insists. A psy-\nchologist is called in. And then, Mary does start talking. \nOnce she does, she can't stop. \nIt's a wild story. Highly disturbing. A mansion in Palm Beach. \nA powerful man. This is all far from the principal's wheelhouse. \nIt's definitely a matter for the police. In the meantime, the school's \nrecommending a transfer, purely temporarily, to a facility for \ntroubled kids—ones with \"issues.\" \nMary's a good girl, it's true. But further confrontations at the \nhigh school will not be tolerated. \n21 \n\fCHAPTER 8 \nMichele Pagan: March 2005 \n0n March 15, Palm Beach police officer Michele Pagan \ntakes the first call from Mary's stepmother. \n\"Ma'am,\" she says, \"I'm going to have to ask you to \ncome down to the station.\" \n\"I don't want to say anything more until I speak with my \nhusband.\" \n\"Ma'am, I appreciate that.

The women around here could make a man cry. \nExtortion? \nThe kid's fourteen. What would she know from extortion? \nHave you seen the shows these kids watch? They know about \nthings we've never dreamed about. \nNo, Pagan thinks. This is her case. \nShe's the one who's going to work it. \n23 \n\fCHAPTER 9 \nMary: March 2005 \nary's father and stepmother believe their girl. Officer \nPagan believes Mary's parents. Ergo, Mary must be tell-\ning the truth. The girl's got a sweet, high, halting voice. \nPagan interviews her twice, and both times, she speaks with her \nchin buried deep in her chest. \n\"Tell me, honey,\" says Pagan. \"What happened?\" \nIn her notepad, Michele Pagan writes: While speaking to me, \nMary became upset and started to cry. \n\"This white-haired guy came into the room,\" Mary says. \n\"Wearing only a towel around his waist. He took off the towel. \nAnd then he was all naked, and he lay down on a massage table. \n\"He was a really built guy. But his wee-wee was very tiny.\" \nMary tells Pagan that Epstein spoke only to give her instruc-\ntions, which he did in a stern voice.

Epstein pulled out a purple vibrator and began \nto massage Mary's vaginal area. \nMary's sure that Epstein ejaculated. \"He used a towel to wipe \nhimself down as he got off the table,\" she says. \nThat week, Pagan's assigned to the case, along with six detec-\ntives. Five men, two women. \"A predator case,\" one of them will \nsay. \"This is different from someone who is stealing. This preda-\ntor is a smart person, and that's his desire. He can't stop.\" \nWithin days, another victim comes into the station. She's got \na similar story. \nIt's a tricky case, according to a source closely involved with the \ninvestigation, because the girls involved are far too young to use \nas bait in an attempt to catch Epstein committing another crime — \neven if they were willing to play along. Still, there are other \nstrings that Chief Reiter's team can start pulling. \nTwo weeks later, on March 31, Officer Pagan has Mary make \na controlled call to Wendy Dobbs. \nThe first attempt goes straight to voice mail. \nThe next time Mary calls, Wendy picks up. \nOn the recordings made by Officer Pagan, Mary's voice is \ntiny and tentative, while Wendy sounds mature, gruff, fully \ngrown, like the femme fatale in some old black-and-white movie. \n\"Hey, what's up?\" she says impatiently. \n25 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \n\"Nothing,\" says Mary. \n\"I talked to Jeffrey, and I'm going to his house tomorrow \nmorning,\" says Wendy. \"I'm going to set something up for you.\" \n\"Cool. Like, what do you think?\" \n\"I don't know. I'm going to talk to him tomorrow morning \nwhen I go to his house about it.\" \n\"Urn, how much would I get paid?\" \n\"Talk to him. I'll talk to him tomorrow, and then I'll bring \nyou in the next day. You can talk to him about it.\" \nSo far, so good, thinks Officer Pagan. But she needs more. She \nlooks at Mary expectantly, but not too expectantly, she hopes. She \ncan imagine how hard it must be for the girl. Or maybe she can't \nimagine it at all. But either way, Mary seems to have gotten the \nmessage. Straightening up in her chair, she begins to press Wendy. \n\"I don't know,\" Wendy says in response. \"I don't know. You're \ngoing to have to talk to him about it. I mean, I don't really work for \nhim like that. I just bring girls to him and they work for him.. .. You \ncan ask him, like, 'What can I do to make more money?\" \nMary keeps pressing. \n\"The more you do, the more you get paid,\" Wendy says finally. \n\"Want me to bring my sister for you? So that we can get paid \nmore or something?\" \n\"Well, yeah. That's what I'm saying. I'm working tomorrow, \nand me and him are going to put a schedule together for you and \nyour sister.

His old neighborhood was pressed up against the \njungle border that Haiti shares with the Dominican \nRepublic, and some of the kids he knew would slip over. Those \nkids would stay in the DR for a few days, sometimes weeks. Some \nof them never returned. But the ones who did come back wouldn't \nsay too much about it. \nMost of them didn't talk much at all. \nBy the time he was ten, Noel had learned the truth about \nthose kids. He'd learned that they'd ended up working as \nprostitutes. \nThis was how Noel St. Pierre had learned about evil. There \nreally were devils out in the world. Flesh-and-blood devils, and \n* Noel St. Pierre is a composite character. \n27 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nthey were nothing like the demons he'd heard about in church. \nNoel had never forgotten the way those kids looked. The way \nthey'd turned into old men and old women. They were like zom-\nbies trapped in children's bodies. And now, in America, Noel's \nbeen given a chance to help other kids. \nThat's what the police have told him, at least. \nNoel is a sanitation worker. Still strong at fifty, and lucky \nenough to have found his way to Palm Beach, he gets in to work \nbefore anyone else and keeps his white compactor truck clean, \nalmost glistening. His pickup route runs hot and cold with the \nseasons. But even in the summer, with much less to do, he's on \nthe job early, braced for a six-hour shift that would break a lesser \nman's back. In the winter, the job gets even harder. The Estate \nSection gets especially busy. Some of the parties have hundreds \nof guests. They leave behind mountains of refuse. That garbage \ngets picked up daily, or twice a day when requested. It's carried \nby workers who slip, silently, under the porte cocheres. Then it \ngets whisked twenty miles away to a landfill that the garbage-\nmen call Mount Trashmore. \nNoel's stretch of the Estate Section runs from the Everglades \nClub to the southernmost tip of the island. It encompasses Ban-\nyan Road, Jungle Road, El Bravo Way, and El Brill° Way. His per-\nformance record is spotless. As far as the Palm Beach PD is \nconcerned, he's the perfect man for the job. \nChief Reiter's authorized a \"trash pull\" —a legal way to collect \ndiscarded evidence. In this case, evidence culled from Jeffrey \nEpstein's garbage. But when the police call him, Noel St. Pierre \nsimply assumes that another refugee boat has run aground on \n28 \nthe beach. A sad thing \ntime to time. His home \ndespots who line their \nMany of the refugee: \nMost of them speak \n\"Eske ou ka ede nou, \n\"Can you help us, pl \nThe cops always ne€ \nhelp out before.

A sad thing, but something that does happen from \ntime to time. His homeland, Haiti, is desperately poor. Run by \ndespots who line their pockets while everyday people suffer. \nMany of the refugees are illiterate. \nMost of them speak only Creole. \n\"Eske ou ha ede nou, souple,\" they ask. \n\"Can you help us, please?\" \nThe cops always need a translator, and Noel's been asked to \nhelp out before. But this time the police officer's voice is raspy, \nimpatient. \n\"This time is different,\" the officer says. \"Something very \nspecial. You don't have to accept. But if you do, you'll have to \nkeep things to yourself, completely.\" \nWhen he hears what the story is, Noel accepts. \n\"I'll do it,\" he says immediately. \nThe address he's been given is 358 El Brillo Way. On his first \nmorning, St. Pierre moves swiftly, sneaking a glance through the \nkitchen window at the four silhouettes standing inside.

The work is \nunsavory, but so is the work Noel does every day.

It's a wonder to him that Ameri-\ncan kids would do what the police say these kids have done. \nAmerican kids are rich, after all. Some of them just don't know it, \nhe guesses. \nAmericans always want more than they have. \nThen again, children do stupid things. They don't know any \nbetter. And St. Pierre's trips to the house make one thing clear. \nThese girls are young. Really young. \n\"I hope you can stop this man,\" St. Pierre tells the cop. \nThe detective shoots him a sharp look, and St. Pierre nods. \n\"Please,\" he says, more softly this time. \n\"Can we count on seeing you here tomorrow?\" \nThe detective looks antsy, impatient again. In his hand he's \nholding a scrap of paper that Noel St. Pierre has pulled from \nEpstein's trash. Wendy Dobbs's name is on it. Mary's name is on \nit as well. \nThe detective can't wait to get it to Chief Reiter's office. \n\"As long as it takes, sir,\" St. Pierre tells him. \"Tomorrow, the \nnext day.

From time to time, one of the town's wealthy \nresidents will walk in with a check followed by an inquiry. \nHow much more would the police force need to make this \nremarkably safe community feel even safer? \nA tax write-off? Sure. But why not? Coming from most, it's a \ngenuine gesture. One of appreciation for all they have and for all \nthe department's efforts to guard it. Donations are accepted gra-\nciously, gratefully. In 2004, the department had taken one from \nJeffrey Epstein—the second donation he'd made to the Palm \nBeach PD—for ninety thousand dollars. Generous, even by the \ngenerous standards of Palm Beach. The donation, which Epstein \ndelivered personally, was earmarked for a firearms training sim-\nulator. But that day Michael Reiter had thought something seemed \noff about Epstein. \n31 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nSomething an old cop would notice. \nReiter's officers had told him about complaints they'd gotten \na few months earlier—young women hanging around at the end \nof the block or coming and going at all hours from Epstein's \nhouse. \"There was some follow-up to that,\" Reiter said in a depo-\nsition for B.B. vs. Epstein, a civil suit, brought by a victim, that \nJeffrey eventually settled. \"I think we may have encountered one \nor two of them. [We] may have done a little bit of surveillance or \ntalked to neighbors as to whether or not they had seen that. I \nthink we were of the general understanding that, yes, there were \nvery attractive young women coming and going from Mr. \nEpstein's residence. \n\"We did some level of further inquiry, and we were of the \nbelief that they were all adults. And [we] were also of the belief \nthat there was a possibility that there could be prostitution. But I \nmean that's just not something that we heavily pursued—\nprostitution in private residences; it's common everywhere in \nAmerica. We didn't believe that they were underage at that point, \nand so we had no further interest in it.\" \nReiter had recalled those complaints on the day Epstein had \nshown up with his $90,000 donation. And when Reiter had \nwalked Epstein downstairs, he couldn't help but notice the tall, \nbeautiful woman whom Epstein had brought with him to the \nstation. \nIt struck him as strange that she was standing so stiffly, eyes \ncast downward, as though she were afraid to speak. Not a kid. \nBut not a woman, either. Epstein did not introduce or even \nacknowledge her. To Reiter, this, too, seemed odd. \nIndeed, the statuesque woman was Nadia Marcinkova, a \n32 \nnineteen-year-old be \ndescribed, by anothe \ntive Recarey, as one o \nIn September, seven \ncalls Reiter directly \narms simulator yet? \nCautiously, Reiter \nIf the departmen \nhappy to provide the) \nReiter thanks hir \nnow that Epstein kric \nEpstein's crimes in P \nknows, if the charge \npublic. \nCops like Reiter \nthat they're no longe) \nhelps to hold on to a \nto understand: you s, \nmurders make a kin( \ntion.

And when Reiter had \n:ouldn't help but notice the tall, \na had brought with him to the \nshe was standing so stiffly, eyes \nwere afraid to speak. Not a kid. \ntein did not introduce or even \n>, too, seemed odd. \n,man was Nadia Marcinkova, a \n32 \nnineteen-year-old beauty who lived at Epstein's home and was \ndescribed, by another girl, in a recorded interview with Detec-\ntive Recarey, as one of Epstein's \"like, slaves.\" \nIn September, several months into the investigation, Epstein \ncalls Reiter directly and asks: Has Palm Beach bought the fire-\narms simulator yet? \nCautiously, Reiter tells him that they're still doing research. \nIf the department needs more funds, Epstein says, he'll be \nhappy to provide them. \nReiter thanks him graciously and hangs up. But he's certain \nnow that Epstein knows about the investigation. Thinking about \nEpstein's crimes in Palm Beach makes him shudder. And, Reiter \nknows, if the charges are true, things are going to get ugly and \npublic. \nCops like Reiter are family men, fathers. Some see so much \nthat they're no longer surprised by the ways of the world. Still, it \nhelps to hold on to a natural capacity for outrage. Thefts are easy \nto understand: you see something you need, so you take it. Even \nmurders make a kind of sense once you understand the motiva-\ntion. There's great satisfaction in catching a murderer. But what \nEpstein's been up to is hard to explain. \nWho is this guy? \nReiter's detectives will have to get into Epstein's head. To nail \nhim, they'll have to know him. And to do that, they'll have to get \nto know the people around him. The police already know about \nWendy. That's one procurer, but out of how many? \nWhat kind of person would bring children to a child molester? \n33 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nAnd—Reiter can't shake the idea—other victims had to be \nout there. That lined up with what Epstein's neighbor reported: \nthere were many girls. He needed to find them as quickly as pos-\nsible. It was a race against time. \nAs long as Epstein was free in Palm Beach, more girls were \nsure to arrive at the side of the house on El Brillo Way. \nAlison: September 1] \n/t might start with th•covers charity balls, 1 \nReporters there woul \nso juicy.

On top of that, Chief Reiter knows, Palm Beach is full of \nfreelance paparazzi and seasoned semiretired journalists. \nThey'd kill for the story, too. For them, it'd be a real-life Body \nHeat. \nOver at WPTV, the local NBC affiliate, the phone rings \none day. \nIt's a tip from a kid, sounding nervous. Something about girls \nfrom a local high school. \nThere's a prostitution ring out in Palm Beach, says the boy. \nThe tip gets brought up in a midmorning meeting at which \nthe producers divvy up ideas among the various reporters and \nnewscasts. \n35 \n34 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \n\"Where, exactly?\" a producer asks. \n\"He didn't say, exactly,\" an intern replies. \"He said that a very \nrich man was involved.\" \n\"Who?\" \n\"Didn't say.\" \n\"Did he leave a call-back number?\" \n\"No. The kid sounded really young. Fourteen, fifteen years \nold.\" \nThe producer thinks for a moment, makes a few scratches in \nhis dog-eared notepad. \n\"Okay,\" he says. \"I'm not sure what we can do with that for \nthe moment.\" \nAt some point, some enterprising journalist will put enough \npieces together to get a sense of the picture. Sooner or later, \nsomeone will talk. Maybe a parent. Maybe a cop's girlfriend gets \ngiddy at lunch. The girlfriend's girlfriend mentions it to her hus-\nband, who says something to a golfing buddy in turn. Maybe the \ngolfing buddy knows a reporter. \nOr maybe some lawyer goes off the rez, blitzed off those mar-\ntinis they serve at the Palm Beach Grill. \nSooner or later, there's always talk. At that point, Chief Reit-\ner's job will get much, much harder —with Epstein on one side, \nthe press on the other, and the chief taking flak from all sides. \nBut right now, two months into Reiter's investigation, the press \nis still speaking in whispers. \nRight now, Reiter wants to keep it that way. \nAnd, in the meantime, new pieces of the puzzle keep falling \ninto place. \n* * * \n36 \nOn September II, \nover by the police: \nThe patrol officer] \nvehicle.

But Alison's been in the back of a police car before, and \nshe's cocky and canny enough to pivot the conversation away \nfrom the dime bag she's been busted with. She tells the officer a \nremarkable story about an older man engaging in sexual activi-\nties with high school girls. Alison knows about it firsthand, she \nsays. She's been going to the house on El Brillo Way since she \nwas sixteen. \nAt first the cop's skeptical. He hasn't heard about the investi-\ngation into Jeffrey Epstein's affairs. And, after all, Alison is a \nburnout. But back at the station, he finds out that Alison has not \nbeen bullshitting him. \nThe investigation is real. \nAlison's name and cell phone number match up with messages \nthat have been pulled from Epstein's trash. Instead of copping to \na misdemeanor, she becomes another Jane Doe in the case that \nChief Reiter's colleague, Detective Joe Recarey, is building against \nJeffrey Epstein. \nThe story Alison ends up telling is extremely disturbing. \nLike Mary, she says, she was recruited in high school. She \ntells cops that Epstein would call her his \"number one girl\" — \nalthough, she suspects, there were many others. \nRecarey takes her statement. In the excerpts that follow \n(transcribed from a tape recording made by the Palm Beach \npolice), D stands for \"Detective Recarey,\" and V stands for \n\"victim.\" \n* Alison's name, some identifying details, and dialogue have been changed. \n37 \n\fD: \nV: \nJAMES PATTERSON \nWell, ah, start from, like, how you met him, and then I'll — \nI'll take you through. \nOkay. Um, we [Alison and a female friend] worked at Hollister \ntogether in the Wellington Green mall, and I was mentioning \nto her how I wanted extra money to go to Maine ...I wanted to \ngo camping for the summer, and I couldn't afford a plane \nticket. And—she goes, \"Oh, well, you can get a plane ticket in \ntwo hours.\" I said, \"What are you talking about?\" Like, what \nare you—that didn't make any sense to me, a plane ticket in \ntwo hours; what are you talking about? And she goes, \"Oh, we \ncan go give this guy a massage, and, um, he'll pay two hundred \ndollars for, like, forty-five minutes or an hour.\" And that's all \nshe told me—no details, no nothing. \nShe said that he wanted cute girls, so I looked cute, did my \nbest. I didn't—I didn't think that it was what it was. I wasn't \nnaive enough to think that he was gonna pay me two hun-\ndred dollars just for nothing—I, I don't know, like, I don't \nknow what was going through my head. I absolutely don't \nknow. And I— the back of my mind was thinking, oh, well, \nit could be legitimate, but I was also thinking, you know, at \nthe same time, is she fucking crazy? Like, this guy's not \ngonna pay you money for not doing anything, not letting him \ncop a feel or nothing. You know? So I didn't know what to \nthink, I was like, \"Oh ... if he does something that I have a \nproblem with, then I'll leave.\" \nD: Who were you introduced to? \nV: One of his girlfriends. One of his, like, slaves that he has live \nwith him. And when I say \"slaves,\" like, one of the girls that \n38 \nhe bought to, like, \nto one of them pro \nSarah.

Urn, I was introduced \nto one of them probably, like ... Sarah. I was introduced to \nSarah. Urn, that's his assistant, I think. I think they have sex, \nbut I don't know. Um, I was introduced to his assistant Sarah, \nand she's the one who told me that he would be ready in a \nsecond. And from there I met various other girls. I don't \nreally—I didn't pay attention to who they were, though.... \nSo ... we were waiting on the couch in the bathroom, and, \nurn, Jeffrey comes up, and he's like, \"Hey, I'm—I'm Jeffrey.\" \nHe just introduced himself, and he hands—I remember this \n'cause I was pissed off that she got paid to bring me. Like, I \nwas pissed off. He hands her a wad of hundred-dollar bills \nand says, \"Thank you,\" and she says, \"I'll wait for you down-\nstairs,\" and I was like, \"All right, I'll see you in a little while.\" \nAnd that's how I was brought to Jeffrey. \nUrn. Hold on—I'm remembering. I'm, like, picturing in my \nhead. I wore a skirt. I remember specifically what I wore: I \nwore a skirt and just a regular T-shirt. And I was massaging \nhis legs, and he asked me to take off my skirt. And I said—I \nthink I said no at first. And he's like, \"Come on, you're not \nshowing\" —he talked me into it, basically. He's like, \"Oh, \nyou're not showing anything,\" or [he] did something; I don't \neven know. So I ended up taking off my skirt, and then he \ngoes—well, I think he just started touching, you know, the \ntop of me. So—and then he asked me. \nWhen you're saying \"the top of you,\" you mean your \nbreasts? \nYeah. And then he asked me to take off my shirt. So I took off \nmy shirt, but I kept my underwear on. And I wouldn't take \n39 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nmy underwear off: I told him no. And he still paid me the \nsame amount. And that was that. I went home. \nD: So, in other words, he — \nV: Finished with himself and that was it. Yeah, he ejaculated. \nSpecifically. \nD: That was the first time you went there? \nV: Mm-hmm. \nD: And—I know, take a deep breath, I know, I can see it in your \neyes already. From then on, you went there multiple times? \nV: I had problems with it. [With] what happened the first time. \nBut three hundred dollars for forty minutes—that was a lot \nfor a sixteen-year-old girl making six bucks an hour. \nD: So you're saying you're sure you were sixteen now? \nV: Urn, I don't want to say I'm sure of my age. I was under seven-\nteen, one hundred percent. \nD: Okay. Urn, when you—the first time you went, when he \nmasturbated, did you see? \nV: [giggles] \nD: His member? \nV: Oh, I thought you were going to ask me if I saw, like, his come. \nD: No. \nV: I saw all of the above. \nD: You saw him naked, fully naked? Fully naked? \nV: Yeah, a hundred percent naked. He had a towel on for some \nof it, but that doesn't mean anything. Like, he was naked. \nD: He took off the towel? \nV: I saw everything, yeah. \n40 \nI mean, I'm sorry, \ncised, a hundred a \nhas some sort of bii \nit is [giggles]; I've n \ndone anything whi \nit—out of the who \nhis penis.

Like, he was naked. \n40 \nI mean, I'm sorry, he is circumcised, my bad. He's circum-\ncised, a hundred and ten percent sure. A matter of fact, he \nhas some sort of birth defect. On his thing. I don't know what \nit is [giggles]; I've never really looked at it, because I've never \ndone anything where I had to touch it. I've never touched \nit— out of the whole time I worked for him, I never touched \nhis penis. Like, he—I'm pretty sure he rubbed it against me, \nbut I've never ever been, like, \"Okay, I'm letting you do this\" \nor \"I'm gonna do this to you.\" Um, it's really weirdly shaped. \nI don't know— do you want me to, like, tell you this? \nI'm just really embarrassed. Urn, it's like a teardrop, like a \ndrop of water. It's really fat at the bottom and skinny at the \ntop, where it's attached. And he never gets fully hard, ever. \nLike, I just could tell by looking at it—like, by looking you \ncan obviously tell if you're hard or not, and I could tell that \nhe wasn't. \nD: The next time you went, or as you continued to go, did it \nescalate more? \nV. Mm-hmm. I actually—I don't remember how long it took for \nme to start working for him regularly, from the first time I \nwent there. But I started working every day. Every single day \nhe was in the country I would be there ... And, urn, I told \nhim that I wouldn't let him put anything inside of me; that \nwas my rule. Nothing inside of me—no fingers, no, no noth-\ning, absolutely nothing inside of me. He increased my pay to \nthree or four hundred dollars as long as he could touch me. \nUm, I still never—I, I swear I never touched him, the whole \nt, entire time I never, ever touched him. Urn, but he, he-\n41 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nD: How many times would you say you went? \nV: Hundreds. Hundreds. I was—he used to tell me I was his \nfavorite. He bought me a car. He bought me — \nD: This Jeep that you're driving? \nV: No. I had a brand-new Dodge Neon. I got a plane—I got a \nplane ticket to New York; I got spending money whenever I \nwanted. Like, I was in there deep. I was—he asked my par-\nents to emancipate me so I could live with him. Or he didn't \nask my parents, he asked me to ask my parents, I'm sorry. He \nactually wanted me to come live with him. \nD: As, like, a girlfriend? \nV: Sex slave, whatever you want to call it. Yeah. Urn, but it \nescalated—he, he just increased my pay, as long as he could \ntouch me. I wouldn't let him put anything inside of me. And \nthen one day he just did, one day he just put his hand, like, \nhis fingers—and, urn... \nD: How long, would you say, from the very first time you went? \nV: Months. Honestly, I never kept track, like, of, of what happened \nwhen. I just can tell you in which order things progressed. \nIt was—it was, like, towards the middle and end of my \nschool year. But I remember that for the last, like, six or eight \nweeks of high school, I didn't have a car 'cause I gave it back \nto him. Because he—he asked me to have sex with him and, \nlike, like suck him and stuff [giggles], and I was just like, no. \nDefinitely not. I was like, \"I'll let you touch me, but I'm not \ngonna do that.\" \nYeah, the car was a Dodge Neon 2005. He got it for me before \nthe New Year, because I remember I got it—it was an edition \n42 \nD: \nV: \nD: \nD: \nV: \nD: \nthat was a year befc \ngot it, I obviously , \ngot a 2005 Neon in \ncar was awesome [: \nI gave it back befor, \nfor me.

I \ngot a 2005 Neon in 2004. Seven miles on it when I got it. The \ncar was awesome [giggles]. \nI gave it back before I graduated. It got too—it got too sticky \nfor me. He wanted more than I was willing to give. I didn't \nwanna — I didn't want to, um, suck his dick. I didn't want to \nhave sex with him. I never did that, and I wanted to be able \nto walk away from this saying that I—saying that I never did \nthat. And I'm glad that I did. \nBut I lied to him when I gave it back. I didn't want to burn my \nbridges, because he was a spectacular connection to have. \nSpectacular. Even if I didn't—even when I didn't work for \nhim. Until this day, he is so aw— he is so—I haven't talked \nto him in, like, a couple months, but if I called him today he \nwould give me as much money as I asked him for. He doesn't \nknow that I hate him the way I do. I kept that connection. I \nfigured he used me, I'd be able to use him. Urn, I hate to say \nthat, but I figured if I wanted to use him I could. \nD: Okay. Let me bring you back a little bit. \nV: Sure. \nD: When did things start to escalate as far as things happening \nwhen the massages were given? \nV: They escalated whenever he wanted. I don't clearly under-\nstand the question. \nD: Okay. The first time you went, you were naked — \nV: Are you asking for a date? \nD: Oh, no, no, no-\n43 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nV: ... and the little steps that things progressed? \nD: Right. \nV: Well, I went and I wouldn't take off my panties at first. And \nthen he got me to get naked. Then he got me to let him rub me. \nThen he got me to let him stick his fingers in me. Then he got \nme to let him go down on me. Then, um—that was pretty \nmuch the gist of it, except this one time, where he bent me over \nthe table and put himself in me. Without my permission. And I \nflipped out. I'm sorry, I didn't ask you, but I don't count that as \nme having sex with him.... 'Cause I just told you that I never \nhad sex with him. I never did. Even though, I don't know what \nyou'd consider that. But he then—I go, \"What are you doing?\" \nHe goes, \"Oh, I just wanted [redacted] to see this.\" \nD: Okay. Let me back you up. When you were completely naked, \nthe same things happened? You went in, you massaged him? \nV: Sometimes I didn't even do that. Sometimes he just asked me \nto take off my clothes and—he'd have to do work, he'd be \nsitting at his desk or something, and I'd just be naked there, \nwatching television or reading a book, but I'd be naked. Or, \num, sometimes he wanted to just watch TV or read, and he'd \nlay in his bed and ask me to take my clothes off and lay with \nhim. And that's it. Not touch him or anything.... Sometimes \nhe'd just invite me over for breakfast, for dinner, or just to \nuse the swimming pool, and I'd get paid for that, too. I'd get \npaid just to hang out with him. That's it. And if the money \nwasn't there, I wouldn't have ever been in that house. \nD: Okay. When he started to touch you — \nV: I have a question. Before I say anything else. Urn, is there a \npossibility that I'm gonna have to go to court or anything? \nLike, that's a possibility, right? \nD: Well, here's the thin \ngoing to sit down, NA, \nhe did to you is a cril \nV: Would you consider \nbe rape, what he didi \nD: If he put himself insi \nV: I didn't say that, or ai \nis about, like, my hip \nD: That, that is a crime. \nV: I don't want my fan \ndoesn't know any of t \nfor two years, or how \nthinks I made phone \ning my [unintelligibli \nknow anything. \nD: Well, you're an adult \ndone with this interv-\ndecide the best coursE \nV: 'Cause Jeffrey's gonm \nHe's gonna find—he's \nI'm not safe now.

But that \nD: Who's he talking to? \n\fFILTHY RICH \nER SON \ngs progressed? \nke off my panties at first. And \nlen he got me to let him rub me. \nhis fingers in me. Then he got \nie. Then, urn—that was pretty \none time, where he bent me over \nWithout my permission. And I \nask you, but I don't count that as \n.ause I just told you that I never \nEven though, I don't know what \nm —I go, \"What are you doing?\" \ndacted] to see this.\" \nben you were completely naked, \n(ou went in, you massaged him? \nhat. Sometimes he just asked me \n—he'd have to do work, he'd be \nking, and I'd just be naked there, \nLng a book, but I'd be naked. Or, \no just watch TV or read, and he'd \ntake my clothes off and lay with \nh him or anything.... Sometimes \nbreakfast, for dinner, or just to \nid I'd get paid for that, too. I'd get \nhim. That's it. And if the money \nre ever been in that house. \nouch you—\nsay anything else. Urn, is there a \nhave to go to court or anything? \nght? \n44 \nD: Well, here's the thing: When this is all said and done, we're \ngoing to sit down, we're going to discuss this. I mean, what \nhe did to you is a crime. I'm not gonna lie to you. \nV: Would you consider it rape? Like, would you consider that to \nbe rape, what he did? \nI/ If he put himself inside you, without permission — \nV: I didn't say that, or anything. I was standing up and the table \nis about, like, my hip length—he just put me down — \nD: That, that is a crime. That is a crime. \nV: I don't want my family to find out about this. My family \ndoesn't know any of this. My mom thinks I was his secretary, \nfor two years, or however long—a year and a half. My mom \nthinks I made phone calls for him and that's how I was mak-\ning my [unintelligible] money. That's it. I don't want her to \nknow anything. \nD: Well, you're an adult. You're an adult now.... When we're \ndone with this interview, we'll discuss this further and we'll \ndecide the best course. \nV: 'Cause Jeffrey's gonna get me. You guys realize that, right? \nHe's gonna find—he's gonna figure this out. And he's gonna — \nI'm not safe now. You understand that, right? I'm not safe. \nD: He is not this person that he is portraying himself to be — \nV: Well — \nD: Why do you say you're not safe? Has he said he's hurt people \nbefore? \nV: Well, I've heard him make threats to people on the telephone, \nyeah. Of course. \nD: You're gonna die? You're gonna break your legs? Or — \nV: All the above! But that's not the point. \nD: Who's he talking to? \n45 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nV: I don't know. I don't know, I heard those conversations, I \nmean, I've been in the room when he was on the phone and \n[unintelligible] threatened. Like, I witnessed lots of things. I \njust don't know what, specifically you all [want to know]. \nD: Everything. \nV: I used to go there every day, like I w —I don't, I don't know \nhow many other girls he was saying, \"You're my favorite, and \nI want you to live with me\" to, but I was in about as deep as \nyou can get. \nD: He had quite a few girls he would say that to. \nD: Do you have any formal massage training? \nV: [Giggles.] Hell, no. \nD: All right, I was just asking. \nV: He would kiss me and stuff, too. I remember that. And when \nhe kissed me, if he was jerking off he would, like, rub him-\nself on my breasts. And I ... I was extremely uncomfortable. I \nwould maneuver myself away from that activity. I'd get up \nand I'd move somewhere else, or I'd—I don't even remember. \nI would stop whatever was going on without saying, \"Can \nyou get the fuck off me?\" I would stop it without saying stuff \nlike that. \nD: Okay. \nV: I wouldn't let him put anything in me until one day he did \njust out of nowhere. And I said, \"Wait a second: my boyfriend, \nyou know, we had this thing, you can't do that. You know, \nI'm —I'm allowed to work here as long as you don't do that.\" \nAnd he said \"okay.\" Well, a couple months later I guess he \n46 \nassumed me and my \nit one day; he just did \nI said, \"What are yo \ncool,\" and he goes, \"C \nI said, \"No, we did nc \nuh, and then he just c \nwhy don't I just give y \nout?\" And I was like \nno to.

And then \nI said, \"What are you doing?\" I said, \"You know that's not \ncool,\" and he goes, \"Oh, I thought we did that last time.\" And \nI said, \"No, we did not do that last time.\" And then he goes—\nuh, and then he just offered me more money. He's like, \"Well, \nwhy don't I just give you something extra, and we can try this \nout?\" Arid I was like [sigh], \"All right.\" Very hard guy to say \nno to. I don't know if. any of you guys ever talked to him.... \nOh, yeah. Well, if you talk to him, I mean, he straight up \ntries to control the situation.

Like, that's his job; that's how he made his \nmoney is knowing what people are gonna say and what peo-\nple are gonna do. \nWhat did he tell you he does for a living? \nWell, there's a couple of things. Things that I found for \nmyself, things I looked up on the Internet. What he specifi-\ncally told me when I asked him the first time was, \"Oh, I'm a \nbrain scientist.\" And I said, \"What the fuck is a brain scien-\ntist?\" I was like, \"That's not a real job—tell me the truth.\" \nBut anyway ... his explanation was, \"It's my job to know how \npeople's brains work.\" And I said, \"Whatever the fuck that \nmeans. Whatever. You're like some old guy who [unintelligi-\nble... I\" You know what he promised me? Here's the reason I \nheld on so long is, he promised me that I would get into NYU. \nThat I would get into NYU and he would pay for it. And I \nwaited, and I waited, and I scored great on my SATs, I would \nget 4.0—like, I did great in school. I filled out my application \n47 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nD: \nV: \nD: \nV: \nand he told me that it wasn't good enough. So I filled it out \nagain, and it was like three times. So I'm pretty sure he wasn't \nchecking into it, he was just telling me that he was. But I \nthink that had a lot to do with the reason I stayed there so \nlong, 'cause my dream was right in front of me, you know? \nAnd it's so far.... \nAside from having been with [redacted], \nelse that you brought to the house? \nI brought a few people.... Because it got \nLike, everyone at school knew. You know \nIt was a circle, and—\nIt was a little circle, yeah.... Not that I would want anybody \nto get involved. ... I brought girls I didn't like and, frankly, \ndid not give a shit about. Girls that I knew were skanks. That \nwould do anything. Girls that would just, like, suck dick in \nthe bathroom at school. Like, not even people I was friends \nwith. I'd just hear a rumor about a girl and be like, \"Hey, I \nknow a way you can make two hundred dollars. How \nabout ...\" I would tell them flat out, like, \"This is what you've \ngot to do. Are you cool with this? 'Cause I'm not gonna take \nyou if you're not.\" So I told them. They all know that I got \npaid to bring them. It was actually [redactedl. She took off \nher shirt. She was a little overweight, so he didn't want any-\nthing to do [with herb She was my best friend. But, you \nknow, she was another story. I did care about her. But, urn, \nshe lost her house and stuff and really needed money. She \nhad—she was homeless, she had nowhere to go. So she did it \nout of desperation. \nD: Did he ever hurt you? \nwas there anybody \nout that I did this. \n, everyone talks—\nV: Sometimes he got vic \nD: Violent as in what?

But he \nwould pull it to where it would rip my hair out. it would rip \nmy hair, and then sometimes he would pick me up and, like, \nthrow me whichever way he wanted me, and then he would \njust like use a toy or, like, his hand or whatever. Never his \npenis, though, ever. I never had sex with him. But urn—I'm \nlittle, so he could pick me up. Like, if you pick me up and \nthrow, obviously it's gonna hurt.... \nI mean, there's been nights that I walked out of there barely \nable to walk, urn, from him being so rough.

Yeah [laughs]. \nD: Okay. \nV: Urn. But honest, I mean, I'm not—I'm not a ho. I've had only \nthree steady boyfriends, and those are the only three that I've \never done anything with.

[Dobbs] was \nasked if she wanted to make money. She was told she would \nhave to provide a massage and should make $200. [Dobbs] \nthought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey. \nMolly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last \nname) picked [Dobbs] up and she was taken to Epstein's \nhouse. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to \nEpstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also intro-\nduced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led \nupstairs to the main bedroom known to her as Jeff Epstein's \nbedroom. \nSarah arranged the massage table and covered the table \nwith a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them \nnext to the massage bed. Sarah then left the room and \ninformed [Dobbs] Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered \nthe bedroom wearing only a towel. \nHe removed the towel and laid nude on the massage \ntable. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a \nmassage oil for [Dobbs] to rub on him. \n\"He tried to touch me, and I stopped him,\" says Dobbs. \nI asked how he tried to touch her. [Dobbs] stated that Epstein \ngrabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. \n\"I'll massage you,\" Dobbs had told Epstein. \"But I don't want \nto be touched.\" \n[Dobbs] stated she performed the massage naked. At the con-\nclusion of the massage, Epstein paid [Dobbs] $200. \n53 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nAfter the massage Epstein stated to [Dobbs] that he \nunderstood she was not comfortable, but he would pay her if \nshe brought over some girls. He told her the younger the bet-\nter.

But \nI do want to talk you about Jeff Epstein, and the whole... \nthing. \nDOBBS: And I don't need a lawyer, right? \n55 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nRECAREY: It's up to you. If you wanted one, you can have one. \nI can't tell you yes or no on that. That's totally [up] to you, I'm \nonly — \nDOBBS: I'm not gonna get in trouble for anything I say, right? \nRECAREY: Right now, you're just a witness. I'm talking to you as \na witness.... That's totally up to you. You wanna talk to me? \nDOBBS: I have no problem telling you everything I know. I'm a \nvery cooperative person. \nRECAREY: Okay. How did you first meet, um.—\nDOBBS: I first met Jeffrey—I was at a beach resort on Singer \nIsland, and I was approached by this girl I went to school \nwith. Her name was [redacted]. And she was asking me, you \nknow, \"Oh, you need extra money, I know this guy....\" I \nthought about it and I finally gave her a call, and her and her \nfriend [redacted] met up with me. I actually picked them up \nand we drove down to Jeffrey's house. She introduced me, \nwhatever. \nRECAREY: Okay. Now, what [do] you mean by making money, \nhow do you make money with Jeffrey? \nDOBBS: Um, there's two ways. There's two ways you can make \nmoney. He'll, all right — \nRECAREY: That's all right. Talk to me. Talk to me like, like \nnothin'. \nDOBBS: How do I say— this is going to sound really sleazy, but \nRECAREY: No. Go ahead. Talk to me. \nDOBBS: Every girl that meets Jeffrey starts off with giving him a \nmassage. The more you do with him, the more you make. \nBasically, if you take off your clothes, you're gonna make more. \nIf you let him do things to you, you're gonna make more. \nRECAREY: Like \"do things\" you mean, touch you? \n56 \nDOBBS: Yeah. Touch yoi \nRECAREY: Okay. Does I \nDOBBS: He uses his hand \nI guess it's like a ma \nthat refused to do th \nbut I wouldn't let hirr \nthat he's like, \"You l \nyou $200 for every \ndon't want you to ma: \ngirls to me....\" So th; \nFor every girl that yc \nthat I brought to Jeffri \nthere. \nRECAREY: Just to bring \nDOBBS: Yeah. Just to brir \nRECAREY: Okay. And t: \nwould have to massag \nDOBBS: She knew ever)/ \none of Jeffrey's rules. \nthe house that didn't \nwould tell me, you knc \nexpect, make sure the \nI get in that room I di \nneed to know.\" And, \neverything she was get \nRECAREY: Okay. What di \nDOBBS: I told her the sam \nJeffrey --she came to r \nI basically told her at \n\"What do you have to \n\fTERSON \nwanted one, you can have one. \nit. That's totally [up] to you, I'm \nble for anything I say, right? \na witness. I'm talking to you as \nto you. You wanna talk to me? \ntg you everything I know. I'm a \nirst meet, um—\nvas at a beach resort on Singer \nby this girl I went to school \n.!.d1. And she was asking me, you \nI money, I know this guy....\" I \ny gave her a call, and her and her \nth me. I actually picked them up \n'rey's house. She introduced me, \ndol you mean by making money, \n•ith Jeffrey? \n. There's two ways you can make \n'alk to me. Talk to me like, like \ngoing to sound really sleazy, but \nk to me. \nJeffrey starts off with giving him a \nlo with him, the more you make. \nur clothes, you're gonna make more. \nyou, you're gonna make more. \n,ou mean, touch you? \n56 \nFILTHY RICH \nDOBBS: Yeah. Touch you in inappropriate places. \nRECAREY: Okay. Does he use his hand? Does he — \nDOBBS: He uses his hands and, I really wouldn't call it a vibrator — \nI guess it's like a massager? But urn—I was one of the girls \nthat refused to do that. I did it basically my—I did it naked, \nbut I wouldn't let him touch me or anything like that. So after \nthat he's like, \"You know what?\" He's like, \"Listen, I'll pay \nyou $200 for every girl that you bring to me.\" He's like, \"I \ndon't want you to massage me anymore, you know, just bring \ngirls to me....\" So that's the other way you can make money. \nFor every girl that you bring to the table—so, for every girl \nthat I brought to Jeffrey—I would make $200. Flat. Just right \nthere. \nRECAREY: Just to bring a girl. \nDOBBS: Yeah. Just to bring a girl. \nRECAREY: Okay. And the girl that was going knew that she \nwould have to massage him. \nDOBBS: She knew everything. She knew everything. That was \none of Jeffrey's rules. He had a problem with girls coming to \nthe house that didn't know what they were getting into. He \nwould tell me, you know, \"Make sure these girls know what I \nexpect, make sure they know what they want, because when \nI get in that room I don't want them to—you know—they \nneed to know.\" And, as far as [redacteas case, she knew \neverything she was getting herself into. It was all volunteer. \nRECAREY: Okay. What did you tell her that she was gonna do? \nDOBBS: I told her the same thing. I told her, you know, this guy \nJeffrey—she came to me saying she needed money, da da da. \nI basically told her about it. She was like, urn, you know, \n\"What do you have to do?\" I told her. I was like, \"The more \n57 \n\fDOBBS: The more she'd \nRECAREY: The more sh \nDOBBS: Yeah. \nRECAREY: So, she had i \nDOBBS: Urn, I don't kni \nent stories on that. \nBut when I was first \nwho introduced me \nslept with him and r \nor secretary—told \nplays around with ti \nRECAREY: So, when yo \nhappened between y \nDOBBS: Nothing. I woul \nRECAREY: Okay. Did h( \nDOBBS: I wouldn't say he \npointed. But I'm not-\nlet him—I let him lo \nthe question for him. \nkind of down-promoi \nbring girls.\" But as far \nRECAREY: Okay. How \naside from [redacted \nDOBBS: Oh. Urn. A lot. \nRECAREY: A lot? \nDOBBS: Urn, let's see, th \nRECAREY: And all thest \nDOBBS: Every one of th( \nJAMES PATTERSON \nyou do, the more you make. That's it. In order to make money, \nyou're gonna have to go up there. You're gonna take your \nclothes off. But the more you do, is the more you make.\" She \nwalked out of there with $300. So she obviously and evi-\ndently let him do a little more. Plus, on our way home, she \nkinda told me what she did. \nRECAREY: Which was? Give the massage.... \nDOBBS: She gave the massage, and she basically let him, like, \ntouch her, down there. Basically. \nRECAREY: Did he touch her with his hands? \nDOBBS: All with his hands. And then he brought out the mas-\nsager. From what she told me. \nRECAREY: How old were you when you were approached to see \nJeffrey? \nDOBBS: Um, I think I was seventeen? \nRECAREY: Seventeen. \nDOBBS: Sixteen or seventeen. \nRECAREY: Okay. When was the last time you talked to him? \nDOBBS: It's been a while. I can honestly say it's probably been \nabout close to a year. About a year. I actually stopped work-\ning for him. \nRECAREY: Who was the last girl you brought over? \nDOBBS: The last girl I brought over was [redacted[.... \nRECAREY: Okay. You got paid two hundred bucks for taking her \nover? \nDOBBS: Yes. \nRECAREY: Okay. [Redacted] knew... \nDOBBS: She knew everything. \nRECAREY: That she'd have to massage him, and the more she did-\n58 \n\fTERSON \nFILTHY RICH \naat's it. In order to make money, \nthere. You're gonna take your \ndo, is the more you make.\" She \nSo she obviously and evi-\nre. Plus, on our way home, she \nmassage.... \nand she basically let him, like, \nally. \n.h his hands? \n.d then he brought out the mas-\ne. \nAlen you were approached to see \nateen? \nLe last time you talked to him? \nn honestly say it's probably been \nit a year. I actually stopped work-\n;irl you brought over? \nover was [redacted]. \n. two hundred bucks for taking her \nknew... \naassage him, and the more she did \n58 \nDOBBS: The more she'd make. \nRECAREY: The more she got paid. \nDOBBS: Yeah. \nRECAREY: So, she had intercourse with him. \nDOBBS: Urn, I don't know about the intercourse. I heard differ-\nent stories on that. I've never asked him \"Oh, you know ...\" \nBut when I was first introduced to him, my friend [redacted] \nwho introduced me to him, told me that she knew a girl who \nslept with him and made $1,000. But from what his intern—\nor secretary—told me, is that he doesn't do that. He just \nplays around with them. So I heard two different stories. \nRECAREY: So, when you went and you massaged him, nothing \nhappened between you two. \nDOBBS: Nothing. I wouldn't let him. \nRECAREY: Okay. Did he become forceful? Did he get upset? \nDOBBS: I wouldn't say he became upset. I think he was a little disap-\npointed. But I'm not—I didn't care. I knew I was getting paid. I \nlet him—I let him look, but I never let him touch. It was out of \nthe question for him. And I think that's pretty much why he just, \nkind of down-promoted me? He was just kind of like, \"You can \nbring girls.\" But as far as working, you know—\nRECAREY: Okay. How many girls have you brought to him, \naside from [redacted]? \nDOBBS: Oh. Urn. A lot. \nRECAREY: A lot? \nDOBBS: Um, let's see, there's [several redacted names].... \nRECAREY: And all these girls knew what they had to do? \nDOBBS: Every one of them. \n59 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nti \nRECAREY: How long have you been working for him? \nDOBBS: Um ...I probably worked for him for a year. \nRECAREY: Okay. And out of all these girls... \nDOBBS: Those were all the girls I brought. But you have to \nremember, those girls brought other girls, too. \nRECAREY: Oh, okay. \nDOBBS: So it's like—it's like a train. It's like, I introduced him to \nall my friends, and then ... it goes on and on, like that \nRECAREY: Okay.... [Redacted] being fourteen or fifteen at the \ntime—' think [redacted] was fourteen when this happened \nwho else was underage? Out of all these? \nDOBBS: Underage, what do you mean? \nRECAREY: Under eighteen. \nDOBBS: Under eighteen? All of 'ern \nRECAREY: All of them? \nDOBBS: All of them.... \nRECAREY: Okay. Did Jeff know anybody's real true age? Or he \ndidn't care. \nDOBBS: I don't think he cared. He told me the younger the better. \nRECAREY: The younger the better. All right. \nDOBBS: Pretty much. That's how it worked. He didn't—let me \njust put it this way: I tried to bring him a woman who was \ntwenty-three, and he didn't really like it. \nRECAREY: Didn't go for it. \nDOBBS: It's not that he didn't go for it. He just didn't care for it. \nAnd he likes the girls that [are] between the ages of, like, \neighteen and twenty.... But some of them, I think, lie about \ntheir age. I know that when 1 started off young, I think he \nknew better [than] to believe me. I think he knew that I was \n60 \nyounger—like, sev \nteen. Most of those \nRECAREY: Let's talk at \nDOBBS: Okay. \nRECAREY: [Mary] at tl \nDOBBS: Mm-hmm. \nRECAREY: Okay. She \nshe know you work \nDOBBS: I told her. \nRECAREY: You had tol \nDOBBS: Mm-hmm. \nRECAREY: Did you tell \nDOBBS: She knew ever \nRECAREY: Okay. So sh \nsome kind of—\nDOBBS: Contact. Prett) \nwhat his expectatio \ngirls that go up thei \nI was like, \"If you \nyou go in that room \nknow he was goin4 \nright now, he's exp€ \nRECAREY: Basically, tt \nDOBBS: Fondling — \nRECAREY: Fondling — \nDOBBS: Or whatever. A \nJust like, \"Just rem \nmake. But that's—I \nbrought up, told he] \n\fFILTHY RICH \nEERSON \nen working for him? \nfor him for a year. \naese girls... \ns I brought. But you have to \nt other girls, too. \ntin. It's like, I introduced him to \ngoes on and on, like that. \nbeing fourteen or fifteen at the \nfourteen when this happened—\nof all these? \nmean? \nem. \nv anybody's real true age? Or he \nle told me the younger the better. \ntter. All right. \now it worked. He didn't—let me \nto bring him a woman who was \n• really like it. \ngo for it. He just didn't care for it. \ntt [are] between the ages of, like, \nit some of them, I think, lie about \nen I started off young, I think he \n,.ve me. I think he knew that I was \n60 \nyounger—like, seventeen—but I told him I was, like, eigh-\nteen. Most of those girls lie when they go in there. \nRECAREY: Let's talk about [Mary] for a minute. \nDOBBS: Okay. \nRECAREY: [Mary] at the time was dating your cousin, right? \nDOBBS: Mm-hmm. \nRECAREY: Okay. She told you she needed to make money. Did \nshe know you worked for Jeffrey? \nDOBBS: I told her. \nRECAREY: You had told her you worked for Jeffrey. \nDOBBS: Mm-hmm. \nRECAREY: Did you tell her what it entailed? So she knew that? \nDOBBS: She knew everything before she even agreed to it. \nRECAREY: Okay. So she knew that there was going to have to be \nsome kind of—\nDOBBS: Contact. Pretty much. Yeah. I told her. I told her exactly \nwhat his expectations were. I told her what goes on with the \ngirls that go up there. I told her—it was like, \"It's your call.\" \nI was like, \"If you want to do this, fine. If not, fine. But when \nyou go in that room, I don't want to hear you say, 'Oh, I didn't \nknow he was going to do all that.' Because I'm telling you \nright now, he's expecting it.\" \nRECAREY: Basically, this is touching—\nDOBBS: Fondling—\nRECAREY: Fondling — \nDOBBS: Or whatever. And I told her when she went on her own. \nJust like, \"Just remember, the more you do, the more you \nmake. But that's—that's up to you.\" And she asked me, and I \nbrought up, told her I wouldn't do more. \n61 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nRECAREY: Okay. You made that clear, you wouldn't do more. \nDOBBS: No. Screw that! \nRECAREY: But as far as Mary] is concerned. What did she tell \nyou that happened in that room? \nDOBBS: Exact words? If I can recall, when she came downstairs \nfrom—when she came downstairs, me and her and [redacted \nwe all walked out. We got into the car. And I was like, \"How \nmuch did you make?\" She's like, \"Three hundred dollars.\" And I \nlooked at [Mary] and I just knew right then she did more. \nRECAREY: Than just a massage, right? \nDOBBS: Yeah. And I asked her. I was like, \"Well, what'd you do?\" \nShe's like, \"Well, I started giving a massage, and then my \nclothes came off and, you know, he put his fingers inside me. \nAnd then he brought out the massager.\" And that's basically \nwhat she said. \nRECAREY: It's all right. You can talk to me. It's all right. \nDOBBS: It's kind of incredible talking about it, now that I—I \ncan't believe I worked for him. \nRECAREY: But it's okay. You know what, we all go through \nthings in life, you know what I mean? It's an experience. And \nyou can put this experience behind you. \nDo girls that—people that you brought over—how did you \napproach them? That they were going to have to do this... \nLike, if they wanted to work, how did you approach them? \nSay, \"Listen, I got this guy in Palm Beach?\" \nDOBBS: Urn. .. Two of them were my friends. The others were, \nlike, my acquaintances. It was a little more easier talking to \nthem about it, 'cause, like, I knew them. \n62 \nRECAREY: Take a de \nsee you're workir \ncan see it, and I d \nDOBBS: I, urn, pretty \nRECAREY: Straight u \nDOBBS: \"If you're loo \ndown in Palm Be \nhave to give him \nThen, if they were \nI'd go into detail \nthey told me, \"Ye: \nI'd tell them, \"01( \nyou have to do, th \nRECAREY: Did you te \nfrom bringing the \nDOBBS: Most part?

It's all right. \ntalking about it, now that I—I \nm. \nknow what, we all go through \nat I mean? It's an experience. And \n: behind you. \nyou brought over —how did you \nwere going to have to do this... \nirk, how did you approach them? \nin Palm Beach?\" \n/ere my friends. The others were, \nwas a little more easier talking to \nI knew them. \n62 \nFILTHY RICH \nRECAREY: Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath. 'Cause I can \nsee you're working up again. You're working up the tears, I \ncan see it, and I don't want to get you like that. \nDOBBS: I, urn, pretty much I just would ask them — \nRECAREY: Straight up? \nDOBBS: \"If you're looking for extra money, let me know; this guy \ndown in Palm Beach, he's really, really, really wealthy. You \nhave to give him a massage.\" That's all I would tell them. \nThen, if they were interested or told me, \"Yes, I want to do it,\" \nI'd go into detail with them before they'd actually agree. If \nthey told me, \"Yeah, that sounds good, I'm interested,\" then \nI'd tell them, \"Okay, well I'm gonna let you know, this is what \nyou have to do, this is what's gonna go on.\" \nRECAREY: Did you tell them that you were going to make money \nfrom bringing them over? Or.—. \nDOBBS: Most part? I believe they knew.... Most of the girls, we \nwere open about that. We didn't—they pretty much knew I \nwas making money under the table. So... \nRECAREY: Okay. Gimme two seconds. Let me get the soda.... \nGimme two seconds. \nAll right, I talked to my boss a little bit — \nFRICK: —Which is why I'm here. \nDOBBS: Okay. \nFRICK: Obviously I was listening to what you were saying. And \nat this point you clearly implicated yourself on a crime, okay? \nYou've taken girls to somebody's house for the purpose of \nprostitution. More importantly, more significantly, one of \nthose girls was fourteen at the time, okay? Now that's a pretty \nsignificant second-degree felony, okay? I'm not going to kid \n63 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nyou, that is— it's a significant thing, okay? Now, you came \nin, you cooperated with us. The question we have for you \nnow is, do you want to continue cooperating with us and try \nand help us make a case against Jeff? \nDOBBS: I don't think that's really going to help me in the long \nrun, though. I've already admitted to a second-degree felony, \nright? \nFRICK: Yeah, you have. \nDOBBS: Okay, so there you go. What's going to keep me out of \ntrouble? It's not going to keep me out of trouble. I've already \nadmitted committing a crime. \nFRICK: I'm not going to argue with that.... \nDOBBS: So basically I just fucked myself. I can go two ways. I \ncan agree not to cooperate, which is going to put me at — \nwell—now you can use the second-degree felony against me. \nOr you can help and work with it and maybe get myself some \nslack.... \nFRICK: We're still talkin' here. What would the odds be of you \ncontacting Jeff at this point? Have you had any contact with \nhim at all? \nDOBBS: I have not had any contact — \nFRICK: How about with — \nDOBBS: No, none of 'em. None of 'em.... I had a phone call about \nfour or five months ago, and I told my parents. Look, I swear \nto you I'm not anywhere—like, no connection with him at \nall. That's why I pretty much got my number changed. I have \nnot made any communication with him. It stopped. \nFRICK: Okay. Well, I mean, that's good. That's good that you \nstopped.... \n64 \nThis is what we'd \nsome of your ex-\nNow, the questior \nworking for Jeff, i. \nto Jeff?

That's good that you \n64 \nThis is what we'd like to do: We would like to reach out to \nsome of your ex-friends and [unintelligible] talk to them. \nNow, the question is, do we think that they are currently still \nworking for Jeff, in which case they would make a phone call \nto Jeff? Or can we just kinda show up and, you know, have \nyou make a call as we're standing outside and say: \"Hey, you \nknow, these guys wanna talk to you, and I've already told 'ern \neverything?\" Our goal is to make a better case against Jeff, all \nright? \nRECAREY: With your cooperation. \nFRICK: Let me, let me get back to—past--the cooperation \nthing, okay? There are lesser charges that can easily be filed: \nleading to the delinquency of a minor, as compared to a \nsecond-degree felony. You know what I mean? That's a mis-\ndemeanor.... First of all, I'll tell you straight up, okay, we're \nnot going to take you to jail today.... \nDOBBS: Not today. \nFRICK: Well, you're—And here's the other thing: If you cooper-\nate and if we can—If you cooperate, whether we pull it off or \nnot— that's not up to you, that's up to us, okay? So what we \nwould do is if we ended up charging you with like a misde-\nmeanor, we'd give you a call, we'd say: \"Hey, you gotta come \nin, you know.\" \nRECAREY: You sign it.... \nFRICK: That's our preference. You come in, you've been very \nforthright with us, you've been very up front — \nRECAREY: Very truthful. \nFRICK: Do you want us to call your parents, or do you want to \ndeal with it, or do you —As far as we're concerned you're an \n65 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nadult, okay? You're nineteen. You do what you do. You know, \nwe can drop you off at the end of the block if you'd like. Or \nwe can cushion the blow beyond what—but again, you're \nhelping us at this point. We've been pretty forthright with \nyou on what is going on, our options for your future. And \nwhat we'd like you to do obviously is make a couple of calls \nwith us this evening to talk to a couple of your, you know, \nthese other girls. \nDOBBS: I'm not really on a ...Me and my parents really don't get \nalong right now.. \nFRICK: So you'd prefer that — \nDOBBS: If they found out that I was—If they found out that I \nwas into some other stuff....

So \nthey're not exactly happy with me at the moment, and I don't \nwant to do anything that's going to piss 'ern off even \nfurthermore. \nMichael Reiter: Oc \nChief Reiter sifts \nunderage girls - \ncured for Epste \non El Brillo.

Phone numbers pulled from the trash \non El Brillo. An arrest report for Alison, the girl who'd been \ncaught with a dime bag of weed. \nShe'd told Detective Recarey about an encounter that sounded \nvery much like a rape. \nSoon Reiter will ask a judge for a warrant. But not yet. There's \nmore footwork to do, and Reiter calls Detective Joe Recarey into \nhis office. \nLater that day, Detective Recarey and Sergeant George Frick \narrive at the home of a girl named Jenny.* An older woman greets \n* Jenny's, Francine's, and Kristina's names, some identifying details, and \ndialogue have been changed. \n67 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nthem at the front door and invites them inside. She introduces \nthem to her husband and daughter. Jenny is sixteen years old. \nSitting down at the dining room table, they see that she's ner-\nvous. In between biting her lip and fidgeting, she tells them that \nyes, she's been to Jeffrey Epstein's house. \nWendy took her there once. But nothing much happened. \nShe met Epstein's chef and spent some time in the kitchen is all. \nThen she left. \n\"I get what you're asking,\" she says. \"But really, I just want to \nput the whole thing behind me.\" \n\"Okay,\" the officers tell her. \"You have our numbers. But \nJenny, if you remember anything else, you'll find that we're very \ngood listeners.\" \nOne down. Five to go. \nDetective Recarey and Detective Michael Dawson have better \nluck the next day with Francine, a girl who tells them that a year \nearlier, Wendy Dobbs—someone she knew from high school—\ndrove her to the house on El Brillo Way. \nFrancine would have been seventeen at the time. \nNow she's willing to make a sworn statement. The officers \nnoted: \nShe was told she could make money working for Jeff. She was \ntold she would have to provide a massage for Jeff. . She was \nbrought to the kitchen area by (Dobbs].

Then Epstein had entered \nthe room, wearing only a towel. \nShe kept her clothes on during the massage. She advised \nsometime during the massage, Epstein grabbed her buttocks \nand pulled her close to him. Francine said she was [made] \nuncomfortable by the incident involving Jeff. At the conclu-\nsion of the massage she was paid $200.00 for the massage. \n\"Do you have any formal training in massages?\" the offi-\ncers ask. \n\"No,\" says Francine. \nBut she does have one more thing to tell them. \nSarah's been calling Francine's cell phone. \nIt could mean any number of things. The police know already \nthat Epstein's caught wind of their investigation. Now it appears \nhe's doing something about it, or at least he's delegating the \nresponsibility. This troubles the cops. But then, on that same \nday, they get one more break: Jenny calls and says that without \nher parents around she's willing to make a sworn statement. \nIt turns out that Jenny's visited with Epstein several times. \nAnd, it turns out, she'd done much more than sit in the \nkitchen. Without her parents around, she's much more willing to \ntalk about it. \nThe first time she'd gone to the house on El Brill° Way, she \nsays, Epstein had tried to take off her shirt. She'd become upset, \n69 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nand this had led to a fight— a \"verbal disagreement\" —with \nEpstein. • \nShe'd left without getting paid. Gone down to the kitchen \nand told Wendy, \"Let's go!\" \n\"If you're uncomfortable,\" Wendy had told her, \"tell him to \nstop, and he will.\" \nOn the other hand, Wendy had also told her, \"The more you \ndo, the more you get paid.\" \nA few weeks later, she agreed to return to the house on El \nBrillo. \nOnce again Sarah had taken Jenny upstairs and into the mas-\nter bedroom. Sarah had set up the massage table, laid out the oils \nthat Jenny would use. \nThen Epstein had entered the room wearing only a towel. \nJenny had been wearing tight jeans. She had a tight belt on. \nShe kept the jeans on, though Epstein still made a grab for her \nbuttocks. Then he rolled onto his back and grabbed for her \nbreasts. Jenny became upset yet again. But this time, she was \npaid two hundred dollars before leaving. She never did go back \nto the house. But, like Francine, she has one more thing to tell \nthe detectives. \nAnother girl from her high school had been there on the day \nof her second visit with Epstein. Kristina. And later, Kristina \ntold Jenny that she also had \"a problem\" with Epstein. \nGirls seemed to be turning up all the time. And the detec-\ntives were just getting started. \nOne girl leads Chief Reiter's team to another. And every time, \nthey hear the same story. The girls are approached by Wendy \n70 \nA \n1 \nDobbs.

She would bring her upstairs and prepare the \nmassage table. [Cynthia] advised Epstein would ask her \nquestions about herself Epstein knew she was a soccer \nplayer and would be attending [a nearby] university. \nThe cops want to know: Did Epstein know her real age? \n[Cynthia] stated Epstein did and didn't care. The most recent \nmassage she provided was on October 1, 2005. \nOctober 1. \nThat's less than a week ago. \nWhat the cops know now is that Epstein's still at it. \nWhat they're about to learn seals Epstein's fate. \n73 \n\fCHAPTER 17 \nAlison: October ii, 2005 \nAfter speaking with Cynthia, Detectives Recarey and Daw-\nson meet up, once again, with Alison. It's been exactly one \nmonth since her arrest, and once again, she's willing to talk. \nThey have no trouble obtaining her sworn taped statement. \nAlison is eighteen, but she's been going to Epstein's house \nsince 2002. Things got off to a slow start, she says. She received \ntwo hundred dollars for her first session, during which she had \nher bra off but her underwear on. Still, at the end of the session, \nEpstein had asked for her number. \nThen the sessions got heavier. Much heavier, as Detective Recarey \nalready knew. [Alison] stated that during her many visits a routine was \nestablished between her and Epstein, he wrote in his report. \nShe would enter the house and get naked in the bedroom. She \nwould then start with a back massage.

[Alison] \nstated Epstein would then begin to masturbate himself and at \nthe same time would insert his fingers in her vagina and \nmasturbate her with his fingers. \n[Alison] explained Epstein would continue this process \nuntil he ejaculated. He would then utilize a vibrator/mas-\nsager on her vagina until [Alison] climaxed. [Alison] advised \nthat during her frequent visits, Epstein asked for her real \nage, [and Alison] stated she was sixteen. Epstein advised her \nnot to tell anyone her real age. [Alison] advised that things \nescalated within the home as Epstein would instruct and pay \n[Alison] to have intercourse with his female friend, Nada \nMarcinkova [sic]. [Alison] explained the intercourse included \nusing strap on dildos, large rubber penisIsic] and other \ndevices that Epstein had at his disposal. Epstein would watch \nthem have intercourse and masturbate himself. Occasion-\nally, Epstein would then join in during the female on female \nintercourse and provide oral sex to both [Alison] and Mar-\ncinkova. This occurred during the time [Alison] was sixteen \nyears of age. \n[Alison] advised this continued to escalate during two \nyears. The routine became familiar to [Alison]. Epstein's \nassistant Sarah would telephone her every time Epstein was \nin the Town of Palm Beach and would place appointments \nfor her to visit and work for Epstein. Each time something \nnew was introduced, additional monies were produced and \noffered for [Alison] to allow the acts to happen. [Alison] con-\nsented to perform all these acts but was adamant that there \nwas an understanding with Epstein that no vaginal penetra-\ntion would occur with his penis. [Alison] explained that \n75 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nEpstein's penis was deformed. [She] explained that his penis \nwas oval shaped. [She] claimed when Epstein's penis was \nerect, it was thick toward the bottom but was thin and small \ntoward the head portion. [She] called Epstein's penis \n\"egg-shaped.\" [She] stated Epstein would photograph Mar-\ncinkova and her naked and having sex and proudly display \nthe photographs within the home. [Alison] stated during one \nvisit to Epstein's house in which she provided a massage to \nEpstein, his female friend, Nada [sic] Marcinkova, was also \npresent. [Alison] provided the massage in which Marcinkova \nand her would fondle each other's breasts and kiss for Epstein \nto enjoy. Towards the end of this massage, Epstein grabbed \n[Alison] and turned her over onto her stomach on the mas-\nsage table and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina: \n[Alison] stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her \nvagina. [She] became upset over this. She said her head was \nbeing held against the table forcibly, as he continued to pump \ninside her. She screamed \"No!\" and Epstein stopped. She told \nhim that she did not want to have his penis inside of her. \nEpstein did not ejaculate inside of her and apologized for his \nactions and subsequently paid her a thousand dollars for \nthat visit. [Alison] stated she knows he still displays her pho-\ntographs through out the house. \nWhat happened to Mary had been bad enough. But what hap-\npened to Alison was on a whole other level. She'd been caught \nwith some pot, sure. But that was hardly a felony offense. It didn't \nmake her a liar. And, in important respects, Alison's statement \nhad aligned with Mary's and with statements they'd been given \n76 \nby other girls, including \nProbably not.

But again, what she said was \nalso in line with what the police had heard from other girls. \nDetective Recarey and his team had done exceptional work \non the investigation that Officer Pagan had started. \nIt was enough, Reiter decided, to cause a judge to issue a \nsearch warrant. \n77 \n\fCHAPTER 18 \nMichael Reiter: October 2005 \n0 n October 20, Palm Beach police officers execute a search \nwarrant, signed by Judge Laura Johnson, at Jeffrey Epstein's \nhome on El Brillo Way. Inside the house, an employee is \non the phone with Epstein. They ask him, politely, to hang up. \nThen, guns drawn, they walk up the winding stairs to the home's \nsecond story. \nDetective Recarey remains outside and reads the warrant, out \nloud, to Epstein's houseman while another officer videotapes them. \n\"This is your copy,\" Recarey says as he hands over the war-\nrant. \"When we are concluded, I will leave a list of what items \nwe've taken, okay?

They see photos of \nnaked young girls—in some cases, girls they've spoken to about \nEpstein. They also find message pads on which are written first \nnames, dates, and numbers for the girls. \nSometimes there are notes to go with the names and num-\nbers: \"I have girls for him.\" Or \"I have 2 girls for him.\" \nThese notes are signed by one Sarah Kellen. \nEpstein's house has a strangely antiseptic quality. Some of \nthe bedrooms look almost like doctors' offices. In the bathroom \noff Epstein's bedroom, there's a massage table as well as stands \nholding strange machines, which looked like something you'd \nfind in a dermatologist's office. \nIn a wood-colored armoire beside Epstein's bed, they see a \nbottle of peach-flavored Joy Jelly. In the bathroom, there are \nsoaps shaped like penises and vaginas, bottles of Mango Mist, \nmore Joy Jelly, and boxes of tampons. \nThe officers find stacks of UFC videos and DVDs of Rock Star \nand other B-list movies. \nThey also find receipts for books bought on Amazon, such as \nSlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude. \nOn the first floor, detectives are drawn to two secret cameras \nhidden in clocks. On the computer hard drive, they see several \nphotographs of Wendy and other girls. These images appear to \ncome from the camera inside the clock behind Epstein's desk. \nThe officers know where the cameras are because they helped \ninstall them—in 2004, when Epstein complained that someone \nhad stolen a gun and $2,700 from him. Detective Recarey had \ninvestigated that case. But before he could arrest Epstein's handy-\nman, Juan Alessi, for the theft, Epstein contacted a captain in the \n79 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nPalm Beach PD and prevailed upon him to have the investigation \ncalled off. \nEpstein had met Alessi at a luncheonette, he explained, and \nAlessi had agreed to pay back the money. At the time, it made no \nsense to prosecute: Epstein was a busy man. He was going to get \nhis money. But he did invite the police into his home to install \nthe cameras. This was a service that the Palm Beach PD provided \n(though Epstein would be the only one with access to the foot-\nage). But while they were there, the police had noticed a group of \nattractive young women who seemed to be camped out at the \nhouse. \nThe group included Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova. \nNone of the girls was a relative of Epstein— that fact had \ncaught the cops' attention. \nAnd now, as the search continues, the cops see photographs \nof the very same girls. \nOn Epstein's desk, the officers find Alison's high school \ntranscript. \nThe thing is, the detectives can't shake the feeling that the \nEpstein house has been tidied up for their arrival. Shelves look \nas though they've been emptied, and several photographs appear \nto have been removed from the walls. \n\"[Judging] by the condition of the place to be searched,\" \nChief Reiter will say in his deposition for B.B. vs. Epstein, \"some-\none probably had cleaned it up a bit.\" \nMaybe there's nothing too surprising about this. After all, \nReiter's team knows that Epstein's gotten wind of their investiga-\ntion. What is surprising is that for a house that's been scrubbed, \nthere's so much left lying around. \nIn fact, the oddest thing about the search is that someone,* \n80 \nappears to have gone \nnating materials, but \nIt was as if the th \nister as wrong. \nThere's another feelii \nthat they themselves \nFirst Reiter hears \nyers have hired prii \nchecks. \nA public-records \nReiter's own records. \nDetective Recare) \nand that his trash ha. \nIn his entire car( \nthat Reiter's seen or \ning his investigators. \ney's doing great wonl \nand for good reason \nRight now, more vic. \nnow that the warra) \ninterviewing Epstein \n\fFILTHY RICH \nERSON \nhim to have the investigation \nicheonette, he explained, and \nnoney.

But for the moment, he puts it aside. Recar-\ney's doing great work on the investigation. He's deeply invested, \nand for good reason: the detective's got four kids of his own. \nRight now, more victims are coming out of the woodwork. And \nnow that the warrant's been executed, there's no downside to \ninterviewing Epstein's servants. \n81 \n\fCHAPTER 19 \nDetective Recarey, Probable-Cause Affidavit: \nMay 2006 \nOn November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose [sic] Alessi, a for-\nmer houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated he was \nemployed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approxi-\nmately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he was the house \nmanager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his \nresponsibility to prepare the house for Epstein's arrival. \nWhen asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they \ntraveled with Epstein on his private plane. I asked Mr. Alessi \nabout the massages that have occurred at. Epstein's home. \nAlessi stated Epstein receives three massages a day. Each \nmasseuse that visited the house was different.

He knew this because he often set up the mas-\nsage tables. I asked if there were things going on other than a \nmassage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end \nof his employment that he would have to wash off a mas-\nsager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the \nsink after the massage. Additionally, he stated the bed would \nalmost always have to be made after the massage. \nOn January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former house-\nman, Mr. Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn taped state-\nment, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey \nEpstein for approximately six months, from November 2004 \nthrough May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager \nincluded being the butler, chauffeur, chef, houseman [and to] \nrun errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I \nasked Rodriguez about masseuses corning to the house. \nRodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. \nEpstein would have one massage in the morning and one \nmassage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. \nRodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone \nand make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen- or \nEpstein would meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the \nmasseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the \nkitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat. They \nwould then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or Epstein. \nThey would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked \nRodriguez if any of the masseuses appeared young in age. \nRodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be \ntoo young to be masseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's \ndirection, he delivered a dozen roses to [Mary's high school] \n83 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nfor one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew \nthe girls were still in high school and were of high school age. \nI asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot \nmore going on than just massages. \nHe would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the \nalleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators \nand sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would \nwipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them away in \nan armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood \narmoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed.
