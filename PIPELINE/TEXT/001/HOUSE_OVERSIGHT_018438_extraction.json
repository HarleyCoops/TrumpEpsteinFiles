Flox, editor of BlogHer's Love & Sex section\n\"Clarisse isn't afraid to talk about her own experiences with BDSM, relationships, and\nsexual politics. But she's also not afraid to explore some of the issues around consent,\nviolence, and safety that a lot of the kink cheerleaders would like to sweep under the rug.\nShe brings a refreshing honesty to her writing that is often lacking. Add to that a deep\ncommitment to feminism and sex-positivity, and you have an amazing combination.\n\"The tension between kink and feminism is a tough one to hold onto and most people end\nup firmly in one camp or the other. What makes Clarisse's writing phenomenal is her\nsteadfast refusal to avoid doing that. The clarity with which she discusses both sides\nwithout resorting to caricatures or stereotypes is simultaneously inspiring and\nchallenging. If you're interested in either or both, I can't recommend her enough.\"\n~ Charlie Glickman, educator at the classic feminist sex store Good Vibrations\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nThe S&M Feminist:\nBest of Clarisse Thorn\n* * *\nClarisse Thorn\nSmashwords Edition\n* * *\nclarissethorn.com\n@ClarisseThorn\n* * *\nThis ebook is copyright 2012 Clarisse Thorn.

By\nthe end, she'd given a lecture at a seduction convention. This is her story -- and her\ntheories about feminism and seduction to boot.\nhttps://www.smashwords.com/books/view/144451\nIn paperback: https://www.createspace.com/3830583\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nNotes, Acknowledgments and Resources\n* * *\nI had a privileged upbringing. My education and safety nets are the biggest reasons I'm\nable to do the work that I do, and I try not to forget that. I have been blessed with parents,\nfriends, and lovers who have supported me both emotionally and intellectually. Since this\nis a \"Best Of\" my blog, I want to particularly acknowledge the commenters who have\ncontributed their perspective to my blog, and the other bloggers who have responded to\nme and cross-posted my work. There are too many to name, but thank you all so much.\nSpecial thanks to Brenda Errichiello, a guerrilla editor-for-hire. Brenda has been very\ngenerous and helpful to me; errors and weirdness in this book should be blamed on me\nand not her, because a lot of the time she tries to convince me to fix things and I refuse\nout of writerly arrogance. If you need editing for your self-published ebook (and you do),\nthen you should totally contact her. Her website is [ http://www.bee-editing.com/ ].\nI try to keep my writing as accessible as possible. One way I do that is by avoiding jargon\nand by using terms that I think most people will recognize. I often write \"S&M\" instead\nof \"BDSM,\" for example; and when I'm using technical S&M language like \"top\" or\n\"bottom\" or \"scene,\" I try to define the words as I go along. But sometimes I slip into\njargon by accident. Also, plenty of S&M terms are super useful, and giving a quick\noverview of S&M language can go a long way towards describing S&M culture. Hence, I\nhave included a Glossary at the end of this book. Many of the terms in the Glossary aren't\nterms that I use in this book, but you might find it useful or interesting anyway. (I also\nincluded a few terms that come from other subcultures, such as polyamory or queer\nstudies.)\nI've received a lot of feedback over the years informing me that I'm the \"gateway drug\"\ninto feminism for some readers. That's kind of cool, but I want to make it clear that if\nyou're just now getting into feminism, there's lots of other stuff to learn before you draw\nany conclusions. Feminism is a huge, varied, rich movement with lots of history, schisms,\nand discontents. Also, in case it needs to be said, I'm not the only feminist who does\nS&M. There are others, some of whom love my work and some of whom disagree with\nme frequently.\nOne advantage of the blog format, as opposed to more traditional formats, is that each\npost can contain tons of hyperlinks -- and each article has comment space, so there can be\nfascinating discussions that explore each topic more deeply. (Of course, there can also be\nsilly, boring, or offensive discussions.) As soon as a blog becomes moderately successful,\nit develops its own community of regular commenters, and mine is no exception.\nFacilitating and moderating these discussions can be amazingly fun and interesting. It can\nalso be stressful and exhausting. As a commenter community evolves, it shapes how\nother people read the blog's articles and comment on them; sometimes the community\nwill develop norms or tendencies that make certain people feel more comfortable -- or\nless comfortable. I've tried to control this with my blog so that it's a welcoming\nenvironment for most people, but I have such a diverse range of commenters that it's\nsometimes quite difficult.\nI bring all this up because, if you're intrigued by some of the articles you read in this\nbook, I encourage you to check out the original post. In this book, I've made a lot of\nhyperlinks into footnotes, but not all of them. More importantly, if you look at the\noriginal post, you can read the comments. But my commenter community has changed\nover time. Sometimes it's more feminist, for example, and sometimes it's less feminist. So\njust be aware, if you read the comments, that the range of opinions may not reflect any\ngroup that would assemble elsewhere on the planet; that a different community might\nproduce really different comments; and that other articles might have really different\ndiscussions.\nYou can buy this book in paperback form at CreateSpace:\nhttps://www.createspace.com/3878670\nIf you've already read my incredibly awesome book Confessions of a Pickup Artist\nChaser, then thank you!

The resource list, glossary, and formatting\nhave all been updated.\n* * *\nBDSM Resources\nBDSM is a 6-for-4 deal of an acronym that stands for Bondage, Discipline, Dominance,\nSubmission, Sadism, and/or Masochism. Some people call it S&M, B&D, leather, fetish,\nor kink. BDSM can mean very different things to different people, and there are a lot of\nactivities that can fall under the BDSM umbrella; such activities might include spanking,\nMaster/slave role-playing, handcuffs, cages, rape fantasies, razor blades, or all kinds of\nother things.\nI mention a lot of resources in the articles that I've included in this book, but I wanted to\ninclude an overview at the beginning, too.\nHands down, I believe that one of the most important resources within the BDSM\ncommunity is the Kink Aware Professionals list. If you are seeking medical, legal or\nother professional help for a problem that is influenced by alternative sexuality, there is\nprobably someone on the list who can help you. When I was going through my own\ncomplicated and difficult BDSM coming-out process, I tried two therapists from the KAP\nlist. One of them didn't really get me, but the second was wonderfully helpful -- so, if\nyou're looking for a therapist, don't be afraid to shop around until you find the right fit.\nThe list is here: https://ncsfreedom.org/resources/kink-aware-professionals-directory/kapdirectory-homepage.html\nWant more information on how BDSM interfaces with the psychiatric establishment?\nI've compiled the research here: http://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/05/07/thepsychology-of-sm/\nBooks\nIn 2012, the legendary educator Tristan Taormino released The Ultimate Guide To Kink:\nBDSM, Role Play and the Erotic Edge, which is supposed to be amazing. I haven't read it\nmyself, though.\nMy personal favorite beginner BDSM books are The New Topping Book and The New\nBottoming Book, by Dossie Easton and Janet W. Hardy. If you look for those books on\nAmazon.com, you will also see a lot of interesting related books in the \"Customers Who\nBought This Item Also Bought\" section. I remember liking Jay Wiseman's SM101,\nalthough I know some people who have mixed feelings about it; a number of people\nrecommend Screw The Roses, Send Me The Thorns by Philip Miller and Molly Devon,\nbut I've never read it myself.\nIf you're thinking of coming out to a loved one, I recommend the book When Someone\nYou Love Is Kinky by Dossie Easton and Catherine W. Liszt. I've also heard good things\nabout the \"Parents of Alternative Sexuality\" pamphlet by Dr. Amy Marsh.\nIf you, like me, are particularly attracted to the idea of needle piercing, there's a great\nbook called Play Piercing by Deborah Addington.\nIf you're more interested in getting a feel for common BDSM philosophies and what the\nBDSM community is like -- an anthropological perspective, one might say -- then there's\na book by Mark Thompson called Leatherfolk, and a newer one by Staci Newmahr called\nPlaying at the Edge.\nWell-known feminist BDSM theory authors from the generation ahead of me include Pat\nCalifia and Gayle Rubin, who are both brilliant.\nOnline\nI usually direct total newbies to this BDSM 101 page by Franklin Veaux:\nhttp://www.xeromag.com/fvbdsm.html\nAs it happens, the same writer has a good Polyamory 101, too: http://www.xeromag.com/\nfvpoly.html\nThere are a lot of websites on BDSM, and they aren't all carefully edited or moderated; so\nif you can manage it, then I suggest you try to get hold of one of the above how-to books.\nThat said... overall, one of the best online BDSM resources is FetLife.com, the kinky\nsocial networking site. Once you have an account, you can join a huge variety of\ndiscussion groups about BDSM. FetLife is not a dating site; it's more like a kinky\nFacebook (seriously). I think that there are important problems with how FetLife is\nstructured. For example, there's no way to search for past topics, which is ridiculous; this\nmeans that the research process for finding discussions is incredibly weird. The BDSM\nactivist maymay has written intelligently about many issues with FetLife:\nhttp://maybemaimed.com/2011/03/20/fetlife-considered-harmful/\nBut the fact remains that FetLife is a huge gathering place.\nAnother good online resource is the amazing sex education site Scarleteen.com.\nScarleteen offers a ton of advice on a ton of sexual topics, and has its own message\nboards.\nThe site KinkAcademy.com has received some good reviews, and features video tutorials\nby some people who are pretty well-known in the community. You have to buy a\nmembership, though.\nThe BDSM writer Ranai from Germany has labored long and hard to make an amazingly\ncomprehensive, international, multilingual directory of kink resources. I haven't gone\nthrough it extensively, but every time Ranai comments on my blog she's brilliant, so I'm\nsure her directory is brilliant too. Here's the directory: http://ranai.wordpress.com/kinkresources/\nThere are so many BDSM blogs that I could never count them all. I want to direct special\nattention to Kink Research Overviews, an abandoned but still excellent blog that profiles\nthe sparse and scattershot research on BDSM: http://kinkresearch.blogspot.com/2009/10/\nwelcome-to-kink-research.html\nIn 2012, Bitch Magazine ran a series called \"Thinking Kink\" by Catherine Scott, which\nexamines S&M and culture from a feminist perspective:\nhttp://www.allthatchas.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/all-of-my-thinking-kink-posts-forbitch.html\nIn Person\nIf you've decided that you want to start attending workshops, discussion groups, parties,\nor other BDSM events in person, please keep in mind that not everyone is going to mesh\nwell with their local BDSM groups. If you don't like your local BDSM group, then don't\nforce yourself to participate! That said, I generally encourage people to get into their\nlocal community, because it truly can be an amazing resource -- it's way more than just a\nplace to meet partners.\nIf you make an account on FetLife, you may be able to join groups for your area (for\nexample, if you live in Chicago, then you should look for Chicago groups), where local\nissues or events will be discussed and publicized.\nFor those aged 18-35, many major cities have branches of The Next Generation, a.k.a. the\nlocal \"kinky youth group.\"\nOtherwise, just Google around. It's much easier these days than it was for our parents.\n* * *\nThis resource list can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/bdsm-resources/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nTable of Contents\n* * *\nHere's a link to go back to The Very Beginning.\nAnd here's a link to the Glossary.\nThroughout this book, footnotes will look like links in the text.

I started blogging as Clarisse Thorn in 2008, but my coming-out\nstory wasn't published until early 2010, when Time Out Chicago picked it up. I look over\nthis piece today, in 2012, and I think about what I would have written differently if I'd\nhad the hyper-focused feminist sex educator instincts that I have now. I would have\nwritten differently about consent, and I would have written differently about the\ncommunication that happened with my partners about my consent. I would have talked\nabout how the S&M subculture isn't always welcoming for everybody, though it feels\nwelcoming for me. Plus, I'm no longer practicing monogamy; I'm polyamorous these\ndays.\nBut at the time, my goal was to do two things: (1) write out how S&M stigma felt for me,\nas a young feminist, and to talk about how I was overcoming it. And (2) show that\nsometimes a partner just isn't good for you, even if he has a quality that you really really\nwant -- and you can always walk away.\n* * *\nLove Bites: An S&M Coming-Out Story\nI was very drunk. My perceptions had a frame-by-frame quality, and the evening didn't\nseem immediate: pieces of it were foreign, disconnected as a dream. I was being bitten\nvery hard on the arm. It would leave marks the next day.\nI was so muddled by assorted things that even now I can't sort out how I felt at that\nmoment. When Richard's nails scored my skin I gasped, but I didn't ask him to stop. I\nflinched away, but he kept a firm grip on me. \"Beg for mercy,\" he said softly.\nFrame. Skip. I discovered that a mutual friend of ours had seen us, stopped, and was\nsitting on the grass across from Richard. \"Hey,\" he said. \"You shouldn't do that.\"\n\"It's okay,\" Richard said, \"she likes it,\" and pulled my hair hard enough to force me to\nbow my head. I do? I managed to think, before thought vanished back into the blur of\nalcohol and pain. Our friend's face loomed over me, concern sketched vividly on his\nfeatures.\nI closed my eyes.\n\"Mercy,\" I whispered.\n* * *\nLater, Richard reminded me of something I said that night: \"I wish I'd met you years\nago.\" Thinking hard, I could only recall the evening in broad strokes. We'd gotten drunk\nat an outdoor party; he'd hurt me a bit; I'd said that; and then I'd staggered off to help\nclean up.\n\"A lot of crap comes out when you do this stuff,\" he now said. A few weeks had passed. I\nwas lying on my stomach across the foot of his bed. Sitting perpendicular to me, he\nleaned back and propped his feet on the small of my back. Thin and pale, he tended to\nwear black, and had intense dark eyes. It was summer in 2005. I was twenty years old.\nHe'd asked me why I wanted to be hurt. I couldn't work out an answer -- wasn't certain\nthe question was valid -- so I asked him why he liked to hurt people. He'd half-laughed,\nwith a tone that I couldn't evaluate. Ruefully? \"That's a long, dark road,\" he'd said.\n\"How do you know?\" I asked, irritated by his presumption, nervously curious. I wasn't\nsure I was what he thought I was -- wasn't sure what had been going on that night,\nbeyond alcohol dulling my reactions and feelings. But I knew I hadn't been abused or\nviolated. I hadn't asked him to stop, and I wanted to figure out why. \"How did you know\nabout me?\"\n\"I can tell,\" he said, and grinned. \"With you, it was obvious.\" He paused, added quietly,\n\"You were begging for it.\"\nA couple of hours later, we remained fully clothed, my face was buried in his pillow, and\nI was crying. He'd pinned me down so I couldn't move, and was raking his nails across\nwhat was exposed of my tank-topped back. When Richard first spotted the tears, he'd\nasked if I wanted a break. I'd said that it was okay, that he should continue, that I was\nfine.\nI felt myself fragmenting, desperation and terror and pain pouring through me in an\nunbearable, necessary torrent. I told myself over and over that it didn't hurt that much, but\nI couldn't stop myself from tensing, crying out. After a while, I found myself saying,\n\"No.\"\nI felt him check himself, shifting his weight from my back. \"Can we clarify something?\"\nhe asked gently. \"Do you really want me to stop when you say no?\"\nNo, I realized, I don't, and something vital in my psyche seemed to snap. The tears\noverwhelmed me. I couldn't get an answer out through my sobs, but even if I could have,\nI haven't the faintest idea what I might have said.\n\"We should take a break,\" he decided, and moved away. I'll never forget the relief -- and\ndesolation -- I felt as he did.\n* * *\nIt was a long time later that I remembered: I had met someone like Richard, years before.\nIt had been in spring 2003; the guy was thin and pale, dressing mainly in black. I hadn't\nonce thought of him in a romantic light.\nI'd counted him a friend, but had only been alone with him once. We were in his living\nroom, seated next to each other on dun-colored carpet. I couldn't recall how it started --\nwe'd been sitting playing video games? had he tickled me as I shouted invective at the\nscreen? -- but it ended with him holding my wrists, me lying back on the floor and\nwondering how to get him off me.\nI'd thought he might kiss me, so I turned my head away. Instead, he bit my neck. \"No,\" I\nsaid aloud, more in startlement than anything else, and he gave me a searching look -- as\nif he wasn't sure I was serious. \"Please let me up,\" I said, and he asked, \"Why?\"\nI didn't feel panicked, but strangely at a loss: he didn't seem to take my objection\nseriously. Yet he wasn't particularly threatening me, and I wasn't afraid. I explained that I\nwas in a committed, monogamous relationship I didn't want to disrupt; I carefully didn't\nreact when he bit me again, although it hurt.\nI didn't say I wasn't getting anything out of my powerlessness or his apparent desire to\nhurt me, that it left me cold. Maybe I wasn't sure it would register: he hadn't appeared to\nbelieve me when I first told him to let me up. And maybe something in me agreed that\nsuch a response was incorrect.\nEventually, I got away. Stupidly, confused, I mentioned the incident to my boyfriend. Of\ncourse he was furious; I had to calm him. For my part, it hadn't occurred to me to be mad.\nThat didn't feel as bizarre as it sounds -- on some level, I felt that the whole incident was\nreasonable, even if it hadn't turned out to be what I wanted.\nNot then. Not with him.\n* * *\nAfter I cried my heart out in his bed, Richard was very kind. He brought me a glass of\nwater and listened as I said a lot of bewildered things. When I finally ran down, it was\nlate; he invited me to sleep over, but didn't put the moves on me. The next morning, he\ntold me he had work to do. Straightforwardly, I asked when I could see him again. He\nsmiled, said to email him, that we'd work something out.\nThe next few days -- weeks -- time, I don't know; however long it was, it felt like being\nput through a shredder. I couldn't think about anything but that night and how, through\nmy turmoil and tears, I'd found a kind of exultation. I had been sober, prepared and clearheaded.\nI couldn't find a way around the brutal, uncompromising revelation that\napparently, I wanted nothing more than to be subordinated, used, hurt. I actually wanted\nto be a victim.\nI wanted to talk to someone, but wasn't sure how to frame my words. I was positive it\nwould help to talk to Richard, but he was busy, and busy, and busy. I had a number of\nfriends who I suspected were into hardcore BDSM; I could have called any of them. But\nit was one thing to be fine with other people doing it, and quite another to discover such a\ndesire in myself. In another situation, I would have thoroughly deconstructed my obvious\ndouble standard -- but just then, it was a minor irrationality on top of one big chunk of\ninsanity.\nI considered asking my loving, liberal parents for advice and tried to imagine how it\nwould go.\nMom. Dad. I love you, and I'm so sorry. I know you've tried to give me an independent,\nrational, feminist outlook, as well as self-esteem and integrity. Sadly, none of this\nappears to have taken; I guess I'm a broken mockery of everything you tried to instill. I\ndon't want you to worry, or blame yourselves, but have you any advice on where to go\nfrom here?\nNo.\n* * *\nMy mental images of that summer are hazy with remembered anger. As Richard\nremained occupied, I felt fury building within my fascination. I'm sure I felt like the\nclassical woman spurned: he was nice enough when he ran into me and told me he was\nthere to talk if I needed it, but the evidence contradicted his words. For weeks after that\nnight, if I tried to see him he didn't have time.\nIt didn't help that he reacted very badly when I went after him aggressively -- too\naggressively, I knew, but couldn't help it -- and told him honestly how vulnerable I was.\nHe backed off fast, leaving me more confused than ever. (Though not too confused to\nthink: How stereotypical.)\nIt went beyond being a woman spurned, though. Especially since I believed,\nintellectually, that he didn't owe it to me not to be busy. He wasn't required to sort me\nout. And -- since it seemed to be what I was after -- he wasn't obligated to continue\nhurting me. We'd just met, after all.\nIt was more that I was enraged by how desperately I wanted to be hurt -- and infuriated\nthat someone, anyone, could have such power over me. I had always thrown myself into\ninfatuations; like most people, I'd been known to get angry at the object of my affections.\nBut this was different. Not only was I infatuated, I was aching for something I couldn't\nreconcile. Even if Richard had been the perfect counselor I had no right to expect, I might\nhave hated him. As it was, I felt toyed with, and found as many other reasons to dislike\nhim as I could. As long as I could focus on wrath, I didn't have to think about my other\nfeelings.\nIt kept me from falling apart.\nHe was away for most of the summer. I went to a few trusted friends for reassurance and\nvalidation; giving few details, I allowed my anger to calcify. But Richard ended up\nsurprising me. On a visit to Chicago, he called me every night for a week. The bruises he\nleft took weeks to fade, some of them bleeding and leaving scars. I raged as I covered the\nworst of them -- but felt also a low-burning fulfillment. One close friend, Andrew, caught\nsight of a bruise on my leg and cast me a worried look. \"That looks pretty bad,\" he\nobserved, and I could only say, \"Yes.\"\nBy then, I'd well and truly internalized the belief that Richard didn't want to deal with\nemotional vulnerability, and my furious resentment remained. This feeling was not\nhelped by society in general; men hate emotions, right? Still, the more time I spent with\nhim, the more I had to admit that he made an effort to be sensitive. Most of our failures to\nunderstand each other came from how different our relationship paradigms were, not to\nmention my unevenly-repressed identity crisis. I know I tried to warn Richard that I\nwasn't doing well at expressing myself and that what I thought, or felt, or believed I was\nmight change on short notice; but I doubt I got even that concept across.\nHe identified fairly publicly as a BDSMer, and made it clear that he considered me\nsuperficial and cowardly because I was unsure about doing so myself. He was also\npolyamorous, a lifestyle that I had some experience with -- but though I respected others'\nchoices to engage in it, I'd decided against polyamory for myself. It felt strange to draw\nthe parallel, but it was somewhat like dealing with a difficult boyfriend. Still, I didn't\ntrust him, and our relationship didn't particularly involve sex.\nJust pain.\nTowards the end of one night, wan light filtering through my curtains, Richard inquired\nunexpectedly, \"Are you happy with the way we are now?\"\n\"What do you mean?\" I temporized, sighing inwardly. Now I'd have to come up with a\nrational, coherent answer that would satisfy him. In those days, rationality and coherence\nfelt like improbable dreams.\nRichard explained that he hadn't particularly been satisfied with how he'd dealt with me\nbefore he left, but hadn't had time for anything better. Now, he thought the situation was\n\"healthier.\" \"What do you want from this?\" he asked seriously.\nI want the strength to walk away from you, I thought unclearly. I want you to actually\ncare about me. I never want to see you again. I hugged my arms to myself, resting my\nhands gingerly on swelling skin. \"Um,\" I said slowly, \"nothing in particular?\" I took a\nbreath and gathered the one overriding fact: I want you to keep hurting me. \"I don't expect\nanything from you,\" I told him, \"and I don't want you to expect anything from me.\"\nI knew from his smile that my answer was the right one. I could only hope it was\naccurate.\n* * *\nThe summer passed, Richard away again for the end of it, then returning in September for\nthe beginning of the school year. I, however, was leaving the city soon, and would be\ngone for some time. Those days were my last chances to see him for a while, and I was\nacutely aware of his nearness: I felt oriented towards him, as if I were a compass and he\nwas North.\nBut I still felt the rage, lurking under the surface of my mind like a submerged monster.\nAnd though I ached with disturbingly intense thoughts of violence, it seemed that I was\nstaying away from Richard, closing him out when I ran into him. He finally confronted\nme and asked, blunt as ever, if I was avoiding him. I denied it reflexively. How could I\navoid North?\n\"I'm still figuring out how I feel about you,\" I told him as we walked late one night on the\nwaterfront. I'd started to come to terms with being a masochist, had begun to assimilate\nthat into my self-image, but that didn't explain why it had taken him to force the\nknowledge on me. The man I'd known in 2003, for instance, made no impression --\nthough he'd obviously seen exactly what Richard saw, and had taken almost exactly the\nsame approach. And I'd known heavily, formally BDSM-identifying folks for years. I'd\neven experimented with light bondage in previous relationships -- being gently tied up,\nfor instance -- though I hadn't found it especially compelling.\nWas it that I'd been drunk the first time I encountered Richard, my careful rational mind\nturned off? Was it that nothing less drastic than the bruises he'd left could have forced my\nunderstanding? Was it simply that I'd been romantically unhappy at the time, whereas I'd\nbeen content when that other man pinned me to the floor? Even in the midst of my nowconstant\nconfusion, I couldn't stop myself from analyzing it all to bits. Now I concluded\nthat I ought to know how I felt about Richard if I wanted to get to the roots of myself.\nIt had taken me a while to call my openly-BDSM friends for advice, but -- maybe around\nthe same time I really started acclimating -- I had. One of their offhand comments came\nto mind. \"I guess there's no reason you would know this,\" she'd said, \"but it's fairly\ncommon for people to have one person who's their lover, and a separate person for\ninflicting pain.\"\nI thought about that, and about Richard saying, \"A lot of crap comes out when you do this\nstuff.\" I considered the maxims that tell us that the opposite of love isn't actually hate,\nand how much time I'd spent encouraging myself to hate him. Finally, I admitted that the\nonly term I had to cover this depth of emotion was \"love\"... but that couldn't make it feel\nlike the right word. Then again, it wasn't exactly \"hate\", either.\nHe was a demon, an idol. He hardly felt like a person to me.\nI didn't vocalize any of this. Coming back from the waterfront, we arrived at the\nintersection where Richard would go to his apartment and I'd return to mine. An awkward\npause ensued: I was leaving in a few days, and wouldn't be alone with him again.\nWatching him, I wondered if he was thinking about asking me over, or was looking for\nan excuse not to. I looked away.\n\"Goodnight,\" I said. Walking home, I wished I felt strong.\n* * *\nIt was after I left Chicago that I really started piecing myself back together. My anger\ndrained away quickly, as if an infected wound had been lanced. Perhaps I found my\nstrength under the scab. I figured that maybe all this did identify something about my\npersonality, but it didn't tell the whole story. Even now, I could be independent, rational,\nand feminist, with self-esteem and integrity. Right? Right.\nIt was impossible to deny that the desires were real -- and when I allowed myself to focus\non them, I didn't try. Ruminating on my past, I recalled heart-twisting details that put\neverything in a certain compelling context. It wasn't just the man who'd gone after me in\n2003. Wincing, I remembered childhood fantasies: I'd compulsively written and drawn\nbrutal dreams until, at some confused middle-school point, their horror came home to me\nand I recoiled. In those long-repressed fictions of slavery and pain, I recognized my\nnewly-acknowledged desires.\nOne conversation I'd had with an early boyfriend rang in my head. \"There's a dark current\ninside me,\" I'd told him. Self-consciously, I'd averted my eyes at my own melodrama. \"I\ndon't know how to be with you, when I feel it.\" I hadn't exactly been trying to leave him,\nbut I'd needed something more.\nThe last dream I remember of Richard didn't involve any pain at all: he just kissed me.\nAwakening, I felt a melancholy pang. Richard invested a lot of self-conception in being a\nsadist, and he was so distant -- I couldn't imagine relating to him as a lover. And I knew\nour relationship (such as it was) would never have started without BDSM as a focus.\nPrevious to that night at the outdoor party, he'd hardly registered on my romantic radar,\nand we had little in common in terms of how we dealt with relationships.\nStill, for a moment I wished -- unreasonably, I knew -- that I could have fallen\nstraightforwardly in love.\n* * *\nI was gone for six months, and I returned in heartbreak. A relationship more important\nthan words can encompass had become -- after years of attempts -- impossible. I think it\nwas obvious. One friend told me vulnerability was all over me; like a scent, I thought,\nand wondered if Richard could smell it. In worse shape than ever, I saw Richard and\nlaughed with an edge to my voice. I gave him doe-eyed looks, but deflected his interest\nwith doublespeak and icy tones. I wanted him, and I felt the rage returning. I hated and\nsheltered behind the unclear verbal games we played. Furious and despairing, I refused to\nchase him, yet I felt him everywhere. North.\nI had to do something. My identity had somewhat solidified: I was into BDSM. I believed\nit, I even accepted it, but I couldn't go on feeling like I did.\nIn looking around the Internet, I came upon a directory of Kink Aware Professionals,\nincluding therapists who provided their names for people who needed to talk about\nBDSM but feared judgment. I visited two. One listened to me silently, with a vaguely\nsorrowful expression; he offered no feedback, and left me wondering why he'd listed his\nname in the directory. He obviously didn't know what to do with me, and I got the uneasy\nfeeling that I worried him. Naturally, that didn't help at all.\nLuckily, the other was everything I could have asked for -- open, patient, clearly\nknowledgeable about BDSM. He looked straight at me and nodded understandingly when\nI confessed the whole trail of events; he explained how common my experience was; he\ngave me ideas about where to look for more information, but didn't try to put his own\npreferences into our talks. \"Most people in your situation feel that they've broken a major\ntaboo,\" he said. \"A lot try to get away from BDSM. But I'm not hearing that from you.\nYou want to adjust, not escape.\" I nodded, and arranged to see him regularly.\nStill, I don't think I could have put myself together again without two other things.\nMy close friend Andrew went after me at a drunken party. Shades of Richard, I might\nhave thought, but I never did. Andrew pinned me to the floor, laughed as I fought back,\nhurt me, finally kissed me. When I asked in bewilderment what brought this on, he\nconfessed. \"When you were gone, I missed you,\" he whispered, \"and I've never missed\nanyone like that before.\" He was as afraid of the darkness of BDSM as I had been, yet\nhe'd thought of me and found himself fantasizing. He wanted to try it with me, but first he\nwanted to be sure that he and I would remain close -- wouldn't lose what we already had.\nIn everything Andrew told me -- everything we said to each other, laughing, almost in\ntears, burying each other in embraces, happily drunk and clear-eyed in the morning -- I\nfound the things that were missing with Richard. Uncertain about BDSM, guarding his\nand my boundaries, Andrew wanted to commit to me and to a devoted monogamous\nrelationship. Part of me counseled caution and withdrawal, but as my therapist laughingly\nput it, Andrew was as tempting as an ice-cream factory. It was my chance to fall\nstraightforwardly in love.\nSoon after that, I had to explain to my parents why I wanted a psychiatrist who was outof-network\nfor my health insurance. I closed my eyes as my father asked why I needed\nthis specialist, what his focus was. \"S&M,\" I said shortly.\nWhy had I worried? I knew my parents had striven to give me an independent, rational,\nfeminist outlook. Self-esteem and integrity. I was so lucky, I understood as my father said\nnothing but, \"All right.\" It was a blinding realization: my father might have judged me\nwith all the worst things I thought of myself -- but instead, he trusted me to do my best.\nWhen I called my mother (long separated from my dad), too many of my flatmates were\naround for a private conversation indoors. I banished myself into a warm summer storm,\ncradling my cell phone away from the rain. There was a pause after I said the fateful\nwords -- then she said, \"Have you talked to your father about this?\"\n\"Yes,\" I said hesitantly. \"Why?\"\n\"Well, I think it was an issue in our marriage that I was more into that stuff than he was.\"\nFat droplets soaked my hair. The tight knot in my chest -- familiar for nearly a year --\nloosened as I caught my breath. I turned my face up to the sky and let the tilted world\nresettle around me; my mother's faraway voice helped me through a hundred things that\nhad torn my heart. \"You aren't giving up your liberation,\" she reminded me, and\nemphasized my continuing right to a partner who respects me. She even noted mildly that\nshe'd \"wondered\" about me when I was a child.\nI'd feared that I was damaged, that there was something deeply broken in me. I'd wildly\nguessed that I'd suffered trauma and repressed the memories. But if my mother -- one of\nthe most independent, feminist women I've ever met -- could reconcile BDSM, then I\nknew I could. And if she was into BDSM herself, then rather than viewing my\nproclivities as damage, I could see them as something intrinsic we shared.\nOver the next hour, my mother told me I could retain rationality, self-esteem and\nintegrity. For the first time, I found myself believing it.\nMy therapist laughed when I told him. \"I swear,\" he cried, \"it's genetic!\"\n* * *\nThere was one loose end to a conclusion that felt like a fairy tale. Though we had some\nunfettered conversations, tension remained between me and Richard -- perhaps it even\nworsened. At one point, observing us, Andrew said mildly: \"Settle down, you two.\"\nWorse, Andrew and I were going in different directions. I finally felt somewhat at peace\nwith BDSM, but he couldn't gain that comfort, and started backing away from it. It was\nimpossible not to think of Richard and shiver, remembering how uncompromisingly\nvicious he could be. When Andrew and I broke up over a year later, I knew: I shouldn't\nsee Richard. My therapist warned me to be careful with BDSM when my heart was in\npieces.\nOf course I wasn't.\nIt was the first time I'd explicitly pursued Richard since he'd told me, so long ago, that he\nwas busy. I emailed him straightforwardly, sat down on his bed shortly after Andrew and\nI broke up. When Richard set his fingernails into my skin, he murmured, \"It's been a\nwhile,\" as if he'd always known he'd see me here again. The tears came more quickly\nthan they once had -- I'd fought them then, unwilling to break down in front of him. I'd\nbeen successful, too. Richard had only made me cry once, before.\nThis is what I want, I reminded myself as Richard wound his hand in my hair and pulled\nmy head back. His teeth bruising my shoulder felt familiar and wrong. A kiss on my neck\nsent me rigid. Sobs nearly choked me. Why now, my heart cried, why not when you were\nwho I dreamed of, Richard?\nI couldn't fault his empathy -- he pulled away. \"No,\" I said unwillingly, \"I'm fine,\" but he\nwouldn't continue. Uneasily, he pointed out that I'd never reacted like that. I said he'd\nnever kissed me like that, and he asked, \"Really?\" as if it were a surprise.\nYes, I thought, forcing my tears away. I was desperate for it. I know.\nTo get him to keep hurting me, I had to convince him that I was fine. This is what I want,\nI coached myself. I was nearly composed when Richard mentioned Andrew, and I felt\ngrief rip me open.\nHe watched me cry, got me a glass of water. Shades of two years ago, I might have\nthought, but I never did. I apologized; he said only, \"I thought this might happen.\" On\nsome level, I knew that I had, too -- for all my self-reassurances that I would be fine.\nWhat was I thinking? I asked myself, and the answer came instantly. I had to know.\nWhen Richard asked if I wanted to sleep over, I said I didn't. \"Then don't go yet,\" he said\nsoftly, putting his arms around me where I lay. I rested my head on his chest. I won't tell\nAndrew about this, I decided, wondering if he and I would be together again. Even if I've\nlearned that I don't want Richard anymore.\n* * *\nIn retrospect, it seems surreal that I reacted so badly to my BDSM orientation. The\nagonizing memories of my adjustment have lost their emotional flavor. I've learned a lot\nabout how to practice BDSM safely -- physically and emotionally. I've had multiple\nBDSM partners, and I've had positive experiences in the welcoming BDSM subculture.\nIn recent times, I've even begun to switch: occasionally I'll be the dominant partner,\nthough I feel submissive masochism far closer to my core.\nStill, I remember the unease I felt at first -- and I recognize stronger unease in others. I\ncertainly wouldn't describe this orientation to, say, an employer. I believe BDSM needs a\nliberation movement, just like homosexuality, but I'm not (yet?) ready to be a public\nspokeswoman. And I definitely wouldn't consider dragging others out of the closet. I\nwrite about BDSM under a pseudonym, and I have changed the names of Richard and\nAndrew.\nI fear that others will read this narrative as describing an assault, a near-rape -- and a\nwoman who tried to rationalize her experience by embracing it. That's not what\nhappened. When Richard first pulled my head back and hurt me at that drunken outdoor\nparty, I could have said no. The word was echoing in my mind, waiting on my lips, and I\ndidn't say it because I didn't want him to stop. I was certainly intoxicated, but I wasn't\nhelpless. I was threatened, but I was not afraid. I may have fought self-actualization like a\ncaged animal, but I could not deny it. I have always been this way.\nConversely, I'm afraid that some conservative will read this and say: \"Look how the\nfeminist movement has failed us!\" That's not what happened, either. I identify as\nfeminist, and I don't believe that to be at odds with being a submissive masochist. Indeed,\nI believe that the feminist movement helped my practice of BDSM: it's one of the factors\nthat gave me the strength and self-assurance required to figure out and discuss my sexual\nneeds.\nAndrew and I did get back together; then we broke up again. Richard and I have had\nother nights together. I wish this narrative ended cleanly. I wish I could say that I've\nfound a fairy-tale lover, that I'm now with a man who both hurts me till I cry and gives\nme the relationship I want. (Why stop there? He could be rich and handsome and a great\ncook, too!) But this is my story, not a fairy tale. Just as well; that means I still have space\nto learn. I believe I've gotten better at communicating clearly. I believe I've gotten better\nat sorting out the harsh emotions inspired by BDSM, working with -- and enjoying! --\nthose feelings in the context of a loving relationship. And I hope I no longer objectify my\nsadistic partners to the extent that I objectified Richard. Still, I know I've got a ways to\ngo.\nI see BDSM as a continuum -- similar to the theory that homosexuality is a continuum --\nand sometimes I think that everyone's on the continuum to some degree. I don't think\nAndrew is as far into the continuum as I am, and not as far as Richard, either. But there\nare reasons I was with Andrew for nearly two years, yet never let myself fall completely\ninto Richard.\nA certain kind of devoted relationship is important to me. I felt strongly about Richard,\nand he was a good fit for BDSM, but he couldn't give me the relationship I want. I went\nback to Andrew, though he was far less into BDSM, because I was able to love him. I\nwonder, though: if I ever fall for a completely vanilla man, will I be able to compromise\nthat far? It seems unlikely. Maybe if that happens I'll have to remember my friend's\nwords and find a separate person, a non-lover who inflicts pain.\nI'd rather not do that, but I can't imagine giving up BDSM. The idea feels equivalent to a\nvow of celibacy. As my therapist said, I'm not looking to escape -- especially not now\nthat I've finally adjusted. It wasn't easy, but I feel that today I am triumphant. And I\nbelieve, I hope, that knowing what I want is the surest path to falling straightforwardly --\nhappily -- in love.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/06/30/love-bites-an-sm-coming-out-story-mirror/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nEDUCATION:\n[theory] Liberal, Sex-Positive Sex Education: What's Missing\nI originally wrote this in 2009, then reposted it in 2010 as part of a group drive by sexpositive\nbloggers to solicit donations to Scarleteen.com. Scarleteen is an amazing sex\neducation site run by the equally amazing sex educator Heather Corinna, and it can\nalways use donations! You should totally go investigate that site -- after you're done\nreading my work, of course.\nWhen I first published this piece, the sex-positive film director Tony Comstock\ncommented on Twitter, \"I think that post of yours might be one of the most important\nthings written about sex-positivity in the last 10 years.\" I was really honored by that,\nbecause he does excellent work.\nMy parents occasionally read my blog, and I also got some interesting feedback from my\nmother. She wrote to me: \" Speaking from where I sat when you were growing up: I wish\nI could have taught you what you eventually learned on your own. But I felt there was\nthis unchallengeable wave moving and I didn't have a place to stand to counter it. I kept\nthinking I was leaving you to learn the hard way exactly what I learned the hard way,\nand was still learning, and was despairing of ever learning.\"\nI wrote back: \"For what it's worth, I remember you trying to stem the tide with small\ncomments, and I think that those comments later helped me center myself in a place\nwhere I could reach my own conclusions rather than blindly sleeping around.\" I hope it\nmade her feel better, because it's true. I'm not a parent, although someday I would like to\nbe... but I think one of the hardest things about parenting must be knowing that your kids\nwill learn terrible things from the surrounding world, and the best you can do is try to be\nthere while they process those lessons.\n* * *\nLiberal, Sex-Positive Sex Education: What's Missing\nI am fortunate. I was born in the eighties and I received a great sex-positive upbringing.\nThe public school I attended taught students how to use condoms; middle school health\neducation included a section on sexually transmitted diseases. My parents didn't throw\ntheir sexuality in my face -- but they were almost always matter-of-fact, understanding\nand accepting when they talked about sex. (I'll never forget how, at age 12 or so, Mom\nsat me down and gave me a long speech about how it would be totally okay if I were\ngay.) I was raised Unitarian Universalist, and the Unitarian Sunday School teen program\nincluded a wonderful sex education curriculum called About Your Sexuality. (I\nunderstand that the sex-ed curriculum has been changed and updated, and is now called\nOur Whole Lives. I haven't delved deeply into the Our Whole Lives program -- maybe it\naddresses some of the issues I'm about to describe.)\nSo I think I'm in a good position to describe the problematic signals we face in liberal\nsexual education. Yes, I've experienced the overall sex-negative messages that drench\nAmerica, and they're terrible -- but so much is already being said about those. I also\nreceived lots of sex-positive messages that are incomplete, or problematic, or don't quite\ngo the distance in helping us navigate sexuality -- and I think the sex-positive movement\nmust focus on fixing them.\nI'm so grateful for my relatively liberal, relatively sex-positive upbringing. I think it did\nme a world of good. But here are my five biggest problems with the way I learned\nabout sexuality:\n1. I wish that I hadn't gotten this message: \"Sex is easy, light-hearted -- and if it's not,\nyou're doing it wrong.\"\nDo I believe sex can be easy? Sure. Do I think it can be light-hearted? Absolutely! But do\nI think it's always those things? No, and I don't think it \"ought to\" be.\nI think we need to teach that sex can be incredibly difficult. It can be hard to\ncommunicate with your partner. It can be hard to learn and come to terms with your own\nsexual desires. It can be hard to understand or accept all your partner's sexual desires.\nAnd just because it's hard, doesn't mean that you're with the wrong partner -- or that\nyou're missing some vital piece of information that everyone else has -- or that you're\ndoing it wrong.\nAnd as for light-hearted, well -- sure, sex can be \"happy rainbows joy joy!\", but it can\nalso be serious... or dark. And there's nothing wrong with that!\nI recently talked to a friend, who also identifies as a BDSMer, about our stories of\ncoming into BDSM. Both of us had sadomasochistic fantasies from a very early age\n(mine, for instance, started in grade school -- seriously, I actually did tie up my Barbie\ndolls). I told my friend about how I'd always had these intense, dark, violent feelings --\nbut when I made it to middle school, I remember a change. I had a series of vivid BDSMish\ndreams, and I freaked out. I closed it all away, I stopped thinking about it, I repressed\nit all as savagely as I could.\nBefore that, I had also started thinking about sex. I imagined sex at great length; I read\nabout sex. I had long since filched my parents' copy of The Joy of Sex and examined it,\ncover to cover -- not to mention many other fine sexuality works, like Nancy Friday's\ncompilation of female sexual fantasies My Secret Garden. I was totally fascinated by sex.\nI talked about it so much that one of my friends specifically searched out a vibrator as a\nbirthday present for me. I actually pressured my first major boyfriend into some sexual\nacts before he was ready, which I suppose is an interesting reversal of stereotype (but to\nbe clear, it's not okay that I did that). As I started having sex, I found that I liked it okay,\nbut knew a lot was missing -- and couldn't figure out what.\nIt took me years and years to connect sex to BDSM -- to figure out that the biggest thing I\nwas missing was BDSM. Why? Because BDSM was horrible and wrong, and I'd shut it\naway; BDSM (I thought) couldn't possibly have anything to do with the bright, shiny,\nhappy horizon of sex! Coming into BDSM was a crisis for me partly because -- although\nI knew other people practiced it, and had never thought much about that -- my own need\nfor those dark feelings totally shocked me. This wasn't me. This wasn't healthy sex. Sex\nwas light-hearted, happy rainbows joy joy!... wasn't it?\nIn contrast, my friend -- who had an extremely sexually repressed upbringing -- never\nhad any trouble integrating BDSM into his sex life. Sex, for him, was already wrong and\nbad... so as he got in touch with his sexuality and began having sex, BDSM was involved\nfrom the start. After all, there was no reason for it not to be.\nAs glad as I am that my upbringing was not stereotypically sexually repressed, I have to\nsay that I envy my friend his easy personal integration of BDSM.\n2. I wish this point had been made, over and over: \"You might consider being careful\nwith sex.\"\nI recently read an excellent New Yorker article that reviews the new version of The Joy of\nSex. It talks about the time when The Joy of Sex came out, as well as a similar\ncontemporary feminist book, Our Bodies, Ourselves, and it points out that \"both books\nespoused the (distinctly seventies) notion that sex could be a value-neutral experience, as\nnatural as eating.\"\n\"Value-neutral\": that's a great way to describe the overall attitude about sex that I\nabsorbed. As if sex were something I could do as an amusing diversion, with anyone, at\nany time, and it would always be fun fun fun! As if there was no need to be overly careful\nor sensitive -- sex was just a game I could play, like a sport -- where the worst that would\nhappen if I screwed up might be a skinned knee.\nI wish that there had been an emphasis on how emotions can really matter, when it\ncomes to sex. I wish that there had been acknowledgment of the fact that we can really\nhurt ourselves, and others, when we're cavalier about sex. (Not that we always do -- but\nwe can.) I wish I had understood sooner that sex is not always value-neutral; that\neveryone has all manner of different sexual needs and hangups, anxieties and strong\nemotions. I think maybe there are people out there who can have \"value-neutral\" sex --\nwhere it's totally about physicality and nothing more -- but I am not like that, and I\nsuspect that most people are not.\nWhich isn't to say that I think there's anything wrong with people who can have sex that's\n\"value-neutral.\" (And maybe \"value-neutral\" is not a great term for it; I worry that I\nsound like I'm judging when I use that term.) I just don't think it's a good model for\neveryone, and yet I think that it has somewhat been promoted as if everyone \"ought to\"\nbe that way.\nI think that there are lots of people out there who feel as though the sexual liberation\nmovement \"failed\" or \"betrayed them,\" because they convinced themselves that sex is\nvalue-neutral and then got hurt. You see a lot of assertions along these lines in the\nconservative media -- for instance, here's a quotation from a synopsis of the book\nModern Sex:\nThe 1960s sexual revolution made a big promise: if we just let go of our inhibitions, we'll\nbe happy and fulfilled. Yet sexual liberation has made us no happier and, if anything, less\nfulfilled. Why?... sex today is increasingly mechanical and without commitment -- a\ndepartment of plumbing, hygiene, or athletics rather than a private sphere for the\ncreation of human meaning. The result: legions of unhappy adults and confused\nteenagers deprived of their innocence, on their way not to maturity but to\ndisillusionment.... These beautifully written essays -- on subjects ranging from the TV\nshow Sex and the City to teen sex to the eclipse of the manly ideal to the benefits of\nmarriage -- add up to the deepest, most informative appraisal we have of how and why\nthe sexual revolution has failed.\nI disagree with most of their attitude. We don't need innocence. We don't need sexual\nmystery. We don't need to eliminate teen sex. We don't need to re-establish some\nlimiting, patriarchal \"manly ideal.\" But they've got one thing right: we do need to start\ntalking about sex as something that is not mostly mechanical -- as something that, yes,\ncan be \"a private sphere for the creation of human meaning.\"\n3. I wish I'd learned this: \"Good sex doesn't just require two (or more) people who like\nsex. It requires desire -- and desire simply doesn't work the same way for everyone.\"\nI've said before that I went through a period -- back when I was first becoming sexually\nactive -- where I simply could not figure out why sexual acts with people I didn't care\nabout didn't seem to turn me on. Or rather -- they turned me on a little, but not... much. It\ntook me a while to understand that sex requires more than just two eager people. It\nrequires attraction and desire.\nWhen I was fifteen or so, and at summer camp, I remember making out with a boy. I\ndidn't really want to make out with him, but I wasn't sure how to reject him (more on this\nunder point 5). And I figured: he seems nice enough, so I might as well make out with\nhim. Afterwards, I felt angry at myself, and I felt like I'd wasted my time -- and I felt\nconfused. I'd been bored at best and repulsed at worst, and I wasn't sure why I felt that\nway, or why I'd done something that made me feel that way.\nSo why had I done it? Because I'd thought: \"Sex is value-neutral.\" Because I'd thought:\n\"Making out is fun, right? -- that means I ought to do it when I get the chance!\" Because\nI'd thought: \"My preference not to make out with him is probably just some silly\nrepression that I need to get over.\" Because I didn't understand that desire is complicated,\nthat you can't just make yourself feel desire when it's convenient, and that you don't need\na reason for your attractions -- or lack of attraction. This situation was to reprise itself in\nvarious forms over the next years, until I finally learned that sometimes you simply want\nor don't want things, and that you aren't required to justify your desires.\n4. I wish I'd gotten a list of suggestions: \"Here are some places you might go to start\nfiguring out what turns you on.\"\nI was told that sex was fun. I was even told to explore! But I still spent years with very\nlittle actual idea of what I wanted. No one ever told me how or where I might be able to\nlearn more about my needs, or what exploring my needs might look like. And no one ever\nexplained that people are turned on by different things, that some people like some sex\nacts and don't like others, and that's okay.\nI went into sex with a buffet-style attitude, thinking that I must naturally enjoy sex\nequally in all ways. I was so surprised when I found out that I like some positions better\nthan others! I remember how confused I was when I dated a guy who didn't like fellatio,\nand how hurt I felt -- like his lack of enjoyment meant that I must be doing it wrong,\nbecause everyone likes oral sex, right?\nAnd of course, while I had a pretty comprehensive idea of the vanilla sex acts I could\nexperiment with, I had very little idea of what else was out there. In retrospect I find this\nhilarious, but I remember -- back in my vanilla days -- I had two boyfriends who tied me\nup. They tied me up and were nice to me, and I suppose it was amusing enough, but\ndidn't drive me crazy with lust or anything. And -- this is the kicker -- because I did not\nunderstand that there's a lot more to BDSM than light bondage, because I did not\nunderstand that there are many separate BDSM acts that people can enjoy and\nmany ways to flavor them, I assumed from this experience that I didn't like BDSM.\nI went through my old journal entries the other day and uncovered one in which I,\nconfused, am speculating about what's missing from my sex life: I write, \"I've tried S&M,\nso it can't be that.\"\nWhat a learning curve I had ahead of me, eh?\nI wish someone had tried to explain to me the vast cornucopia of human fetishes out\nthere. I wish someone had explained that erotica and pornography are both actually really\ngood ways to learn about your turn-ons, and -- more importantly -- had told me that not\nall erotica and pornography are the same, so the fact that I wasn't into mainstream\nstuff didn't mean I automatically wasn't interested in all erotica or porn. I've mentioned\nthat I had lots of conversations with friends about sex, but -- until recent years -- those\nconversations were never framed as \"This is what I like,\" or \"I've found something new\nthat turns me on,\" and I wish I'd realized sooner what a great resource conversations like\nthat might be.\n5. I wish I'd gotten a list of ideas: \"Here are some ways you can try communicating\nwith your partner about sex.\"\nLastly, but certainly not least -- I was never taught how to communicate about sex. No\none ever gave me even the first idea. In all my sex-positive, liberal sexual upbringing, I\nwas told over and over that \"relationships require communication\", but no one ever said:\n\"And here's some ways in which you might communicate sexually with your partner.\"\nOne big benefit of teaching sexual communication strategies is that it helps people learn\nto say \"no\" when they don't want to do something. Teaching people how to set\nboundaries is massively important, and I think a lot about ways to do it. I saw this\nadorable video about cuddle parties recently that really struck me -- these people create\nparties where everyone basically just cuddles, but everyone also specifically has the\npower to say \"no\" to any given person or act. The reporter who made the video talks at\nthe end about how she found the whole experience to be empowering -- how she felt like\nit gave her space to say \"no\" that she hadn't had before. Perhaps these could be used to\nteach people to set boundaries?\nBut you can't really use cuddle parties in a school or workshop setting, more's the pity.\nWhen I developed my first sex education workshop, it was all about describing good\ncommunication strategies. I listed questions that all sex partners could benefit from\nasking each other, including \"What do you like?\" and \"What do you fantasize about?\"\nand \"Is there anything you really don't want me to do?\"\nAnd I talked about ways that you can make communication easier, if the two partners are\nuncomfortable having this conversation. I took a page from the BDSM community by\ncreating checklists of all kinds of sexual acts and weird fetishes and gender-bending\ncraziness, and I put it all on a 1-5 scale (with 1 being \"not at all interested\" and 5 being\n\"I'd love to try this\"), and I told people that they could try filling out those checklists and\ngiving them to their partners. (The amazing sex education site Scarleteen later\nimplemented the same idea, in a much more comprehensive way than I had!) I suggested\nthat partners write out their fantasies and email them to each other, or write out\ndescriptions of their mutual sexual experiences -- long accounts, describing how they felt\nabout everything and what sticks out in their minds -- and send those to each other, too,\nso they can get each others' perspectives on what they've done.\n(By the way, I still offer a much-improved version of that workshop on my list of events,\nlectures, and workshops, just in case you're interested in bringing me in....)\nGod, it's so hard to talk about what we want. It's even hard to talk about talking about\nwhat we want. I mean, it's hard enough to figure out what we want in the first place -- but\ncommunicating it... eeek! And it's worth noting that this is not just a problem of having\ngood sex. As was pointed out recently on the blog for the wonderful sex-positive\nanthology Yes Means Yes!:\n[There is a] need to demystify and destigmatize communication about sex. If we can't talk\nabout what we like and what we want, we will always have problems making clear what\nit is we're consenting to. If we can't be frank about what we do want, we put a lot of\nweight on the need to communicate what we don't.\nGiving everyone great sexual communication skills doesn't just give us all better sex -- it\nfights rape. There's a noble cause for you!\n... So, that's my five-pointed analysis. And that's what I'm pushing for. My goals are not\njust to get people thinking that sex is awesome and sexual freedom is important. It's\ngoing to be hard, and it's going to be an uphill battle, but I'm hoping that I can not only\nhelp out with sexual liberation -- I'm hoping to improve it.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/11/11/classic-repost-liberal-sex-positive-sexeducation-whats-missing/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nCOMMUNICATION:\n[theory] Sex Communication Tactic Derived From S&M: The\nAnnotated Safeword\nAs soon as I started researching S&M and thinking critically about the communication\ntactics promoted in the S&M community, I realized that there were a lot of really\nimportant lessons wrapped up in those tactics -- lessons that could be deconstructed and\napplied to all kinds of sexuality. From the beginning, I planned to do a series of posts on\nSex Communication Tactics Derived from S&M, but I only got around to it in 2010.\nThe post about safewords caught the attention of Thomas MacAulay Millar, a feminist\nblogger and S&Mer who is older and more established in the blogosphere than I.\nThomas asked if he could annotate the article, then post it on the blog where he usually\nwrites -- the blog for the excellent sex-positive anti-rape anthology Yes Means Yes. Of\ncourse I agreed. The final product looks something like a conversation between me and\nThomas, although I wrote the post before he added his input.\n* * *\nThe Annotated Safeword\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\nClarisse Thorn's post about safewords is so good I'm just going to repost the whole thing\nand annotate it.\nClarisse Thorn:\nEveryone knows about BDSM safewords... or at least, everyone thinks they know about\nsafewords. But one of the initial moments that really impressed me about my current\nboyfriend was when I asked him, many moons ago, if he knew what a safeword is. He\npaused, then answered, \"I think I'm familiar with the idea, but I probably don't know\nmuch more than a stereotype, so I'd like to hear you define it.\" Humility and open-minded\ncuriosity are so incredibly hot!\nRighto. Hot boyfriend aside, I'm here to explain safewords and check-ins, and how those\nconcepts can exemplify excellent sexual communication for everyone -- not just S&Mers\n-- in a world that doesn't do a good job teaching anyone how to communicate sexually.\nWhen two (or more) people have a BDSM encounter together, generally they set a\nsafeword -- a word that anyone can say at any time to stop the action. (Sometimes people\ndon't use safewords. This is their choice and I totally respect it. I would not recommend\ngoing without safewords for anyone who doesn't know their partner extremely well, and\nI would be seriously sketched out by anyone who pressured a partner to go without\nsafewords.)\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\nA word on origin: safewords are only strictly necessary in one circumstance -- where the\nparticipants want words like \"no\" and \"stop\" not to have their ordinary meaning. One can\ndo BDSM for a lifetime without a safeword, if words have their ordinary meanings. As\nformer porn star and kinkster Ona Zee once put it (I'm quoting an interview from memory\nhere), \"our safeword is 'that hurts.'\" Folks can even do heavy play depending on how they\nreact to things, without a safeword, simply saying \"stop\" or \"too much\" or \"fuck, I can't\nhandle any more of that!\" when the play gets too intense. Any BDSMer who would tell\nyou URDOINITRONG if you use ordinary words to communicate in scene is not\nsomeone you need to listen to.\nSafewords are essential for roleplay where \"no, please don't, I'll do anything!\" should not\nstop the action. It's also essential for any bottom who will involuntarily shout \"No! Stop!\"\nwhile actually wanting more. Other than that, it's an optional tool -- a very, very useful\none, for many reasons. Clarisse mentioned that some people \"don't use safewords.\" From\nthe context, she's talking not about people for whom no means no in scene, but people for\nwhom there is no definitive way for the bottom to stop the scene. And perhaps readers\ncan tell from Clarisse's tone that that's... the advanced class. You'll find the safety police\nin any BDSM space or community that finger-wag about it, and the swaggering morekinky-than-thous\nthat brag about it. But what does it mean?\nI can only tell you what it means for me. There are times I give up my safeword: only to\nmy spouse. We've been playing together for about a decade and a half. If I give up my\nsafeword, and that's something we do rarely, it doesn't mean I don't have limits. I have\nlimits! Yes I do! There are things I can't handle, mentally or physically, and things I\nnever want to handle! There are \"hard limits,\" things I've said I'm just not willing to do.\nAnd there are soft limits, things I don't think I'm ready for but I'm willing to bump up\nagainst them and see what happens. If I give up my safeword, it means I have limits, but\ninstead of telling her when I've reached them, I'm going to trust her to listen to me and\nwatch me and make that decision. I may say, \"I can't, I can't, I can't,\" and she may decide\nI really can't. Or she may decide I've got more in me than I believe I do. There's a lot of\nrisk associated with that. But there's a trust in those moments and a closeness that does\nnot go away when the scene is over. Or ever, really. Risk and reward: we set our own\ntolerances.\nSome folks may have come across the term \"consensual nonconsent.\" It's one of those\nterms with multiple meanings. Some people use it to describe any situation where the\nbottom is saying \"no, don't\" but has not yet safeworded -- a usage I find less than useful.\nOthers use it to describe roleplays of nonconsensual situations. The last common usage,\nthough, is that which I like to describe using Hunter S. Thompson's phrase, \"buy the\nticket, take the ride.\" It means that the bottom consents to be in a situation I've just\ndescribed, where the top decides if the bottom needs to stop, often but not always around\nspecific activities, and usually (wisely) heavily negotiated.\nClarisse Thorn:\nWhen I give advice about setting safewords, I usually offer the following:\nA) Some people like to say that it's good to use a safeword that's jolting, and is likely to\nmake your partner feel totally unsexy. Isn't there a Family Guy episode in which Lois &\nPeter's safeword is \"banana\" or something?\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\nNot a fan. The more obscure a safeword, the harder it is for a bottom who is spacey or\nflying on endorphins to access it. It's easy to remember \"banana\" in the calm before the\nstorm. At the moment when it's most needed, that can easily become a muddle of\n\"yellow? was it a fruit? Shit, what do I do?\" That's not a place bottoms want to find\nthemselves and a top never, never, never wants to have a bottom who is at a limit but\ncan't communicate about it.\nClarisse Thorn:\nB) In my experience, the generally accepted safewords in the S&M community are\n\"safeword\" and, more commonly, \"red.\" I consider it useful to go with the \"public\nstandard\" because that means that in the future, you're likely to be attuned to the correct\nword if you practice BDSM with other partners as well. (It also means that if you ever do\nS&M in a public space such as a dungeon, everyone in the place will recognize your\nsafeword if you scream it.)\nC) At first wasn't that excited about this, but I've grown to love the fact that the safeword\n\"red\" also sometimes encompasses \"green\" -- and \"yellow.\" That means that if I'm in the\nmiddle of an S&M encounter, I can say \"red\" and my partner will stop; I can then catch\nmy breath and say \"green,\" which means \"by God keep going!\" Or, if I'm a little\nuncertain about the territory but don't actually want my partner to stop -- if I just want my\npartner to be a little bit cautious -- then I can say \"yellow\" (and, of course, I can move to\n\"green\" if I become really psyched, or shift to \"red\" if I really want my partner to stop).\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\nMy spouse and I use the \"stoplight system.\" It's simple, it works, and \"yellow\" option is\nreally useful for things that are getting hard to handle. Also, a lot of bottoms are either\nsubmissives or masochists with more pride and stubbornness than is good for them -- the\nformer out of an overdeveloped desire to please, the latter sometimes out of a desire to\nimpress or even just a pitbull-stubborn urge to push themselves as hard as they can go.\nTake the personalities that finish an Ironman and collapse and need IV fluids, and put\nthem on a spanking bench with big welts from a prison strap, and you've got someone\nwho won't safeword when ze probably should. In those and other circumstances, giving\nthe bottom an easy option to say, \"I'm struggling here\" without feeling like they're\nquitting is a very useful thing.\n[Editor's Note: \"ze\" is the gender-neutral pronoun, and it's in the Glossary. Clarisse\ntried to use it regularly for a while, but ultimately concluded that it made her posts less\naccessible to non-gender nerds.]\nClarisse Thorn:\nI know that this probably doesn't sound sexy at all, but it totally can be! Consider the\nfollowing example: during my last vacation to America, I had an S&M encounter with a\ndude I'll refer to as Klark. (It's not my fault. He requested the pseudonym.) At one point,\nKlark was experimenting with hurting me, and I had my eyes closed and was whimpering\n/ crying out in a totally glorious way. (The poor overnight desk clerk. He was only one\nshort flight of stairs away from us.) I think Klark was legitimately having trouble\ndetecting whether I was enjoying myself, though -- understandably, because we had only\njust met, and I enjoy sinking myself into dramatic masochistic misery -- so he leaned over\nme and said, in a low dark voice, \"Red, yellow, green.\" Immediately, I gasped back\n\"Green.\" Because he spoke in a gritty and dominant voice, and the check-in was quick,\nwe were able to maintain the mood -- and it was actually kind of hot in itself.\nWhich brings me to the other thing: check-ins. Sometimes, you want to check in with\nyour partner. Which can be easy: you can just say, \"Hey, how does this feel?\" or, as a\nmore precise example, \"Give me a rating of 1-10 on how good this feels (or how much\nthis hurts).\" But if you want to do it quickly and without shifting the mood, you can do it\nas I outline above in the Klark example. Or even quicker, as for example with the handsqueeze\nsystem, where the participants agree ahead of time that you can squeeze another\nperson's hand twice and expect two squeezes back -- and if there aren't two return\nsqueezes, it's time to stop and figure out what's going wrong. (Squeeze system: also very\nhelpful when gags are involved.)\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\nThere are all kinds of safesigns when nonverbal communication is necessary; one being\nto give the bottom an object to hold and to drop when at a limit. It has the disadvantage of\nbeing binary, so it loses the middle step that the stoplight system provides.\nClarisse Thorn:\nSometimes submissives will have a hard time safewording -- whether out of pride,\ninexperience, or eagerness to please -- and that's another reason check-ins can be good\neven when there's a set safeword. If you aren't sure how to read your partner's reactions\nand you suspect ze may be uncomfortable with what you are doing, then you might\nconsider checking in even if ze hasn't safeworded, because your suspicion may be right.\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\nThis can't be emphasized enough. Tops Can Never Be On Cruise Control! A safeword\ngives the bottom a tool to communicate, but it does not ensure safety. The top has at least\nas much information that the bottom doesn't have, as the bottom has information the top\ndoesn't have. Therefore, the top has to be a full participant in making sure the scene is\nworking and the risks are under control at all times. Anyone who thinks ze can ignore\nsafety as long as the bottom has a safeword is dangerous.\nThis post was edited to add: In the comments on this article, Dw3t-Hthr made a powerful\npoint that for some people, safewords are unavailable in scene. She said, in part:\n[I]f I am in a place where a safeword might be necessary, a safeword is not possible. Not\njust because I am someone who is regularly nonverbal, but because the altered\nconsciousness state that I achieve makes processing those sorts of questions at best\ndifficult and at worst unachievable...\nBut I'm not a bottom, I'm a submissive, and this isn't about \"wanting to please,\" it's about\na psychological incapacity to recognise when I might be doing myself damage in certan\nsituations. If I'm not in that state, I can say \"Oh stop doing that it's wrenching my\nshoulder\" or whatever is appropriate. If I am in that state, I cannot indicate and have to\nplace complete trust in the judgement of my partner.\nI happen to know that I'm not the only person like this. I think it's important to recognise\nthat safewords are not always possible. It's important, I think, to communicate to the\nperson who resembles me in this that while their brainwiring is not morally incorrect,\nthat they probably ought to think of themselves as Advanced Subjects and try to do their\nthing in a context where the trust and competence required to do it safely is\ndemonstrated.\nAlso, a note on terminology: Clarisse used \"submissive\" there in a way where it's not\nclear from the context whether it's meant as an umbrella term like \"bottom\" or as a\nspecific term. The use of \"dominant\" and \"submissive\" as the default terms seems to me\nto have started in the mid 90's, and I've never liked it because of its imprecision. Not all\nbottoms are subs; some people like to bottom but don't have a submissive bone in them.\nSome bottoms are wisecracking smartassed masochists only in it to play the pain game\nand ride the endorphins; some bottoms don't see themselves as giving up power in any\nway to the top. And I top my fair share, but I certainly don't think of myself as a\ndominant. I think the change in terminology arose with a small but vocal minority of\nkinksters who believe that everyone who does BDSM is really looking for a deep power\nexchange, ultimately even a 24/7 relationship. I still see people make this argument.\nThey're still wrong, and they're still few in number. Using \"submissive\" and \"dominant\"\nwhen one means to include folks who are just topping and bottoming may be\nmisunderstood; saying \"top\" and \"bottom\" is almost always correctly understood as the\ninclusive term. (\"Sadist\" and \"masochist\" are specific terms that shouldn't be pressed into\ngeneral service either; there are submissives that really, really don't like pain at all and\ndominants that would prefer never to inflict it.)\nWhat I love about safewords and check-ins:\nClarisse Thorn:\n1) Hypothetically, mainstream society acknowledges that anyone could say no at any\npoint during sex, but in practice, this is really hard. A variety of forces -- girls socially\npressured not to be so-called \"cock-teases,\" boys socially pressured to supposedly \"prove\ntheir manliness,\" and everyone anxious to please their partners -- work against people's\ncapacity to say no; and while there is a vague understanding that \"no means no,\" that\nvagueness is as far as it gets. There's no explicit framework in place for how to say \"no,\"\nand no understanding of how to continue an encounter (or relationship) after one's partner\nsays no. Even worse, there's an assumed linear progression of sexual activity -- the best\nexample is the \"base system,\" which places sexual interaction on a metaphorical baseball\ndiamond where \"first base\" = groping and \"home base\" = penis-in-vagina sex. Have I\nmentioned that I hate the base system?\nSo anyway, the biggest moral of the story with safewords and check-ins is that consent\ndoes not only happen once. Consent is always happening, and can always be\nrenegotiated or withdrawn. Adapting my understanding of sexuality to reflect this --\neven in my non-BDSM sex -- might have been the best thing that ever happened to my\nsex life.\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\nWhat can safewords do for non-kinky people? Permission communication. In a culture\nthat delegitimizes communication -- especially women's communication of limits or\nneeds -- this is huge. Safewords permission \"no.\" That which permissions the free\nexercise of \"no\" also, necessarily, creates space for the free exercise of \"yes.\"\nClarisse Thorn:\n2) On a related note: Good sex is not about entitlement. If we acknowledge that anyone\ncan safeword out of any sexual act at any time, then we acknowledge that no one is\nentitled to any kind of sex from a partner -- ever. If your partner loves you but doesn't\nwant to have sex with you? That's a respectable choice. If you're really turned on, but\nyour partner can't stand the idea of having sex right now? That's a respectable choice.\nThose two are easy, I think, but how about these?\n+ If your partner used to do something with you a lot, but doesn't want to do it anymore?\nThat's a respectable choice.\n+ If you are married to your partner, but ze doesn't want to have sex? That's a respectable\nchoice.\n+ If your partner performed a sexual act with another partner but would prefer not to do it\nwith you? That's a respectable choice.\n+ If you know your partner likes a certain kind of sex, but they don't want to do it right\nnow? That's a respectable choice.\n+ If you think a certain act is \"mild\" and \"taken for granted,\" like kissing or tickling, but\nyour partner doesn't want to do it? That's a respectable choice.\nBy the way, if you (like I once did) feel as though your partner is entitled to sex of any\nkind, I encourage you to re-examine that feeling. Ditto if you've got a little voice in your\nhead telling you that you \"ought to\" be up for sex all the time just because you don't get it\nvery often... or that you \"ought to\" be up for sex if you've done it with your partner\nbefore... or whatever. The other best thing that ever happened to my sex life was when I\nfinally, finally, finally internalized the idea that my partners don't ever \"deserve\" sex for\nany reason -- that there's no reason I ever \"should\" be having sex -- and that the only\nreason I should ever, ever, ever do anything sexual is because I legitimately want to.\nOf course, if you truly believe that you need a certain kind of sexuality in your life, then\nyou're absolutely entitled to ask your partner to consider it -- and you're entitled to leave\nthe relationship if ze isn't up for it. But this doesn't mean that you \"deserve\" to do that act\nwith that person, or that your partner \"owes\" you a certain act.\nAnd hey, if your partner isn't down with one specific sexual act, then that means you've\ngot the chance to explore all kinds of other sexuality. Another other best thing that ever\nhappened to my sexuality? Quite possibly, it's my current boyfriend -- whose religious\nadherence has drastically limited our physical sexual options.\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\nWe're each entitled to our own identity, but not to our own partner. Our partners are\npeople, with thoughts and desires and limits of their own, and they don't have to do what\nwe want them to do. This goes for tops, too! Tops have limits! Because of my blogging\ncovenant with my spouse (what I do as a bottom is personal to me and I decide how much\nI reveal; what she does as a bottom is personal to her and she prefers that those stories not\nbe blogfodder) I don't have any really good stories to share about hitting my limits as a\ntop. But they exist. Tops are not required to be into everything a bottom is into, and they\ndamned sure are under no obligation to do things that make them uncomfortable just\nbecause the bottom wants it -- whether the reason for the discomfort is risk tolerance,\nideology, squeamishness or anything else. Tops can say, \"no, I won't suspend you from\nthat eyebolt because I don't trust it\", \"no, I'm not interested in doing that roleplay because\nI wouldn't be comfortable with it\", or \"I don't do play piercing because blood is a hard\nlimit for me.\" We all have a right to say no to sexual acts we don't want; even if we're\ntopping.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/07/the-annotated-safeword/\nClarisse's original post on safewords can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/07/03/sex-communication-tactic-derived-from-sm-2-\nsafewords-and-check-ins/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nCOMMUNICATION:\n[theory] Sex Communication Tactic Derived From S&M: Checklists\nThis is part of the same 2010 series as the previous article -- in fact, it came first.\n* * *\nChecklists\nS&M checklists are long lists of different acts that sexual partners can use to discuss\ndifferent acts and measure each others' interest in those acts. Each act on the checklist\nusually looks something like this:\nFLOGGING -- GIVING __________________ O O O O O\nFLOGGING -- RECEIVING ______________ O O O O O\nEach partner rates each entry by filling out 1-5 bubbles, with 1 darkened bubble meaning\n\"Not interested\" and 5 bubbles meaning \"I crave this!\"\nI think this concept is brilliant because:\n1) Too often, it's assumed that \"sex\" encompasses certain acts, and if you're interested in\na sexual relationship you must be interested in all those acts. Or there's assumed to be a\nkind of linear progression, as exemplified in the \"base system,\" where \"first base\" is\ngroping and \"home base\" is penis-in-vagina sex. Talking about each sexual act as its own\nself-contained idea short-circuits those problematic ideas about sex and makes it easier\nfor couples to turn down some of the \"assumed\" acts (e.g., if I don't want oral sex but I do\nwant penis-in-vagina...).\n2) It provides an easy way to communicate desires -- if a person is nervous about saying,\n\"Hey, is it okay if I flog you?\" then the couple doesn't even have to talk about it right\n3) Concurrently, it provides an easy way to turn down acts -- it's much harder to reject a\nlover's proposition when ze says, \"Darling, can I flog you?\" than it is when you simply\nfill in one bubble on the \"Flogging -- Receiving\" section. In the past, I've certainly felt a\nlot of anxiety when I wanted to turn down partners, and it's nice to imagine a set-up that\nwould have made me feel less anxious.\nIn fact, I love the checklist concept so much that when the University of Illinois at\nChicago had me design my sexual communication workshop, I created a \"vanilla\" version\nof the checklist that had entries ranging from \"oral sex\" to \"sex in public\" to \"tying up /\nbeing tied up.\" (Okay, maybe it wasn't entirely vanilla... I wanted to encourage people to\nvoice things they weren't sure about!) Then I later found out that the amazing sex\neducation site Scarleteen has created its own non-BDSM checklist, and theirs is way\nbetter than mine.\nI just love the principle of the thing -- the principle that a couple can have a lot of fun\njust by sitting down and talking about every conceivable sex act, being presented with\nsome options that they maybe haven't thought of before, and honestly describing how\ninto each idea they each are.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\naway. They can just sit down, fill out their checklists and compare results without getting\ntoo worried about how to bring up certain desires. I mean, at some point of course they'll\nhopefully talk about it, but hopefully the checklist framework makes it easier and lowerpressure.\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/06/14/sex-communication-tactic-derived-from-sm-1-\nchecklists/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nCOMMUNICATION:\n[theory] Sex Communication Tactic Derived From S&M: Journal-\nKeeping\nThis is part of the same 2010 series as the previous two articles. In this piece, I\nmentioned 24/7 Master/slave relationships, which I had just learned about. Since then,\nI've learned a lot more about those relationships. I have never been in one, although I\nhave occasionally had partners order me to do long-term submissive things. But I've read\nand heard a lot of tales about 24/7 M/s.\n24/7 Master/slave scenarios are rare... and I will say that there are some awful horror\nstories floating around about them. Some BDSMers say that 24/7 Master/slave\nrelationships are always a terrible idea and should never be done. I am unwilling to\ncondemn them so thoroughly, but those relationships obviously require a lot of respect\nand care from each participant. I would advise a person interested in such a relationship\nto only consider it with a partner they know very well; to establish pressure-free\nchannels of communication; and to ensure crystal-clear understanding of how, exactly,\nthe relationship can be ended if anyone involved truly wants it to end.\n* * *\nJournal-Keeping\nSome BDSMers play with really, really strong power dynamics. A good example of this\nis couples who choose a \"24/7 dynamic\": one partner is dominant and the other is\nsubmissive... all the time. I attended a workshop once with Sir Top and slave bonnie, two\nwise BDSM educators, where I learned that slave bonnie was only ever allowed to\ndisobey orders of two kinds:\n* Suicidal orders,\n* Orders that would cause financial ruin.\nThe rest of the time, bonnie obeyed Top -- all the rest of the time.\nObviously, relationships like this are totally cool with me as long as they are -- say it with\nme, everyone -- 100% consensual! Such relationships can also encourage the use of\ninteresting communication tactics, because many of the usual tactics don't feel right to the\nparticipants. For example, these relationships often take place between people who feel\nsuch a strong power dynamic that it would be almost impossible for the submissive to\nfeel comfortable safewording -- safewording can feel disconcertingly like a form of\nresistance.\nOne way of dealing with this problem is for both partners to keep journals that are open\nto the other partner. (With some couples, only the submissive keeps an open journal.)\nThey talk about their romantic feelings, they process their sexual encounters, they\narticulate anxieties, etc. Sometimes a partner will give the other one journal prompts to\nanswer. The idea is that it's easier to express these things when there's a designated space\nfor it outside the relationship; the journals mean that partners (especially submissives)\ncan talk about what they need without fearing that they're undermining the power\ndynamic.\nI find the concept of simultaneous journals intriguing for a number of reasons. One is that\nI've used similar tactics myself; I kept a private journal for many years, and once in a\nlong while I'd give entries to my partners when I needed to explain something\ncomplicated about my feelings. I only did this a few times, ever, but it was really\neffective when I did.\nLater, I took to writing love letters that I noticed were very similar to both my journal\nentries, and to the simultaneous relationship journals suggested for Master/slave couples.\nI realized that I was writing letters because, at the time, I felt more comfortable writing\nabout my desires than talking about them. I've gotten a million times better at talking\nabout my sexuality honestly and shamelessly since then; but back then, there were\ndefinitely things I wrote to my partners that I couldn't have said aloud. I also wrote\nbecause -- just like Master/slave couples -- I wanted to communicate my feelings outside\nthe anxiety-inducing frameworks of the \"serious discussion,\" the bedroom, etc.\nSo when I developed my sexual communication workshop, I encouraged love letters. I\ngave two suggested points of departure for a love letter:\n1) Describe what happened during a sexual encounter you had together, with particular\nemphasis on what your partner did that you really liked -- and what you liked about it. (\"I\nlove it when you fuck me\" is a great thing to say, but you give much more information to\nyour partner if you say \"I love it when you fuck me from behind,\" or even better, \"I love\nit when you fuck me from behind and it feels amazing when your balls hit my clit.\" [This\nblog does not necessarily reflect the desires or encounters of Miss Clarisse Thorn.])\n2) Describe a fantasy you have. Bonus points if you explicitly put your partner in it. (\"I\nlike to imagine you sinking your teeth into me until I scream.\" This blog does not\nnecessarily... oh, who am I kidding.)\nPostscript: In the comments on this piece, a reader noted that they might feel anxious and\npressured if a partner described them doing something specific. I hadn't thought of this,\nbut I totally believe that it could be a problem. Certainly, I've sometimes had experiences\nwriting to a partner where I described him doing something and he thought it was\nridiculously hot... but I've also done it and had partners dislike it. I guess my final advice\nis that -- as with all communication -- you'll want to consider the audience, and be ready\nto apologize.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/07/30/sex-communication-tactic-derived-from-sm-3-\njournal-keeping/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nCOMMUNICATION:\n[storytime] Sex Communication Case Studies\nI wrote this post in 2011, years after the events in my coming-out story, and a long time\nafter I'd done all the above research into communication tactics. By 2011, I'd picked up\nlots of sexual and BDSM experience with a variety of partners. I had just written a post\nabout my most destructive past relationship; the post got a lot of readers and was\neventually cross-posted to Jezebel. I wanted to do something positive with all the\nattention, so I decided to offer a productive counterpoint.\n* * *\nSex Communication Case Studies\nIn the wake of my last post, which was basically a meditation on one relationship with\nbad sexual communication, I want to offer some positive examples of sexual\ncommunication from my life.\n* * *\n1) Low pressure and leather belts. Years ago, when I was pretty inexperienced in the\ncommunity, I had a single BDSM encounter with a gentleman in his home. We met at a\nBDSM discussion group, arranged to meet later at a cafe, and went home from there; as\nwe exited the cafe, I took his driver's license and texted his full name and license number\nto a friend. (I think more people should do this, frankly -- in fact, more non-BDSM\npeople should do this when they go home with strangers from bars.)\nWe sat together on the public transit and quietly discussed the upcoming scene: he asked\nme many, many questions about what I was okay with and not okay with. Questions like:\n\"What do you have experience with?\" \"Could you go into that more?\" \"What do you\nlike?\" \"What makes that fun for you?\" \"Is there anything you really don't want me to do?\"\nHe asked a lot of the questions twice, too, which I think is a really great strategy\nespecially with new partners. People don't always have their heads together enough\nduring these conversations to answer an S&M question properly the first time, especially\nif it's a broad and open-ended question like \"What are the things you really don't want to\ndo?\"\nI made it clear that I just wanted a BDSM encounter, that I wasn't up for oral sex or\nvaginal sex or anything like that. He'd never had a BDSM encounter that didn't involve\norgasm, so it was a new concept for him, but he was cool with trying it.\nAfter our long discussion of boundaries and limits, we made it to his apartment and\nsettled in. He got out some equipment, including a collar, and he said: \"While you're\nwearing this, you will obey everything I say. Do you have any final boundaries to set?\nAnything you really want me to do? Anything else you don't want me to do?\" I said no,\nand he snapped on the collar. (We did have an agreed-upon safeword, though -- so I had a\nway of interrupting the proceedings if I really needed to.)\nIt was an interesting encounter, partly because he was looking more for dominance\n(giving orders) than sadism (inflicting pain), whereas at the time I was looking more for\nmasochism (receiving pain) than submission (accepting orders). So we started out with\nhim giving me a bunch of orders (primarily to fulfill his kink), and then in the end he hit\nme a lot with a leather belt (to fulfill mine). At the time I was still figuring out where the\nboundary was for me: whether I identified as a submissive or only a masochist; how\nmuch submission and masochism were intertwined. That night showed me a lot about\nhow one can create submissive energy within a pre-defined space, even with someone\nyou barely know.\nAfterwards, when I was done crying, he took off the collar and we went to bed. (By that\ntime of night, I didn't have a way back home from where he lived, so I had to sleep over.)\nWe chatted about random things, neither of us quite tired enough to sleep. Within half an\nhour or so, he realized that there was no way he was ever going to get to sleep unless he\nhad an orgasm, but he also understood that I didn't want to have sex with him, so he\ndidn't try to push that. Instead, he said: \"I really need to have an orgasm before I can get\nto sleep. I can either take care of that in the bathroom, or I can do it here. If I do it here,\nthen you can help me along, or not. I'd especially appreciate it if you could talk dirty\nwhile I jerk off, but it's your decision.\"\nTalk about low pressure! Yeah, I learned a lot from that guy.\n* * *\n2) Scripts and Lists. I had one brief relationship last year with a gentleman who is really,\nreally awesome -- but we have very different approaches to S&M. We had a hard time\ncommunicating about it... honestly, if he hadn't been such an awesome guy, I would\nprobably have given up on the relationship after a couple nights together. We were great\nat having extensive theoretical conversations about sexuality, but when it came down to\nactually having sex with each other, things got puzzling. We had difficulty predicting,\nunderstanding, and initiating with each other.\nI'm not sure what made it so hard. I think, mostly, we just brought really different\nassumptions to the table. I tend to take an \"improvisational\" approach to my encounters,\nwhereas he tends to take a \"scripted\" approach. He's into doing stuff like rearranging the\nfurniture, taking on specific roles (e.g. teacher and student), using costumes and props,\nand knowing exactly what will be said beforehand.\nMe, I like going free-form. I talk to my partner about hard limits (things we absolutely\ndon't want to do); I talk to him about things we really like; and we set a safeword. I'm\nusually okay with diving in from there. If he wants a more structured conversation, I'm\nglad to have one (and sometimes, especially when I'm dominant, I'll ask for more\nconversation myself). But generally, I like seeing how things go based on a very loose set\nof guidelines, and making minor adjustments during the encounter, then evaluating the\nsituation afterwards.\nOne of the reasons I like doing this is that unexpected things happen. On the flip side,\nthere's also more room for experiences that aren't very exciting. I think I'm more likely to\nhave disjointed or confusing encounters than a lot of other BDSMers I know, although\nmaybe I'm just falling prey to the bias of assuming other people are doing better than I\nam. And Scripty Guy in particular really doesn't like disjoint and confusion -- he likes\nknowing what's going to happen.\nLate in the relationship, I suggested that we try going through a checklist. When people\nuse these checklists, a lot of the time they just write their rating for each act, and give\nthem to each other to read. What we did instead was go through the checklist together\nand discuss what we found hot, what was not, and whatever else came to mind.\nThis worked amazingly well -- it totally bridged our theoretical gap and it was a turn-on\nin itself! (Seriously, by the time we were done going through the whole list, I could not\nwait to have sex with that guy.) The conversation also helped me figure out the scripted\nvs. un-scripted difference between us.\nWe stopped seeing each other for unrelated reasons soon afterwards, and they were good\nreasons, but it seemed like a shame; I felt like we'd only just started figuring things out.\nI'm not sure how well our S&M styles would have ultimately meshed, but I was curious\nto try. Oh well... win some, lose some.\n* * *\n3) Transparent as Glass. Very rarely, I'll end up with a BDSM partner where our brief\nin-the-moment communications -- you know, like groans, or physical shifts, or facial\nexpressions, or even jokes -- function very well. We can get into intense, intimate S&M\nin a way that seems almost instinctive (although it helps future encounters if we talk it\nover and process what we did afterwards). This is really exciting when it happens, but I\nrecognize it as unusual. A gift.\nThe person I'm about to write about is totally going to get a swelled head because I write\nabout him so much, but he's such a good example, I have to. The first time I went home\nwith him, I knew he wasn't in the public BDSM community. We'd had one really vague\nconversation about BDSM previously, and he'd read a small sample of my work. I didn't\nexpect anything much.\nHe kissed me, and then I think he gave me some kind of mild signal like a bite on my\nshoulder. It was a gentle bite, by my standards. So I took matters into my own hands and\nremoved my shirt, preparing to give him some feedback. He leaned back and said,\n\"Whoa,\" and I thought, Oh damn, I'm totally going too fast for him, he's probably not\naccustomed to a high degree of sexual directness, so I said, \"Sorry, is this okay?\" and he\nlaughed and kind of threw up his hands and said, \"Sure.\"\nThat made me a tad nervous -- if me taking off my shirt surprised him, what else would\nsurprise him? -- but I figured I'd see it through, see what happened. So I explained to him\nwhat kind of biting I really like, and showed where I like it on my back and my arms. I\nthink I gave him a couple of other tips, too, but I honestly can't remember; it didn't take\nmore than five minutes. I certainly didn't give him an exhaustive rundown of my\npreferences before I said, \"Does that all make sense?\" and he said \"Yes,\" and put his\nhands on me.\nWhich is why it was so surprising that within a very short time, both of us were breathing\nhard and confused and maybe slightly dizzy and looking at each other with very wide\neyes, and he was saying in an amazed tone: \"I just -- I'm a little shocked. That was really\ngood,\" and I was saying: \"Yes. Yes it was.\"\nIt went like that for a while. He'd go for it, and then pull back, and I'd drag myself out of\nmy BDSM headspace long enough to explain one or two ideas, or reassure him that I felt\nfine. And then he'd go for it again. And by the end of it, I was -- blazing.\nSometimes, it just works. You've never met this person before, you've talked for half an\nhour about something completely irrelevant like science fiction novels, yet it only takes\nfive minutes of discussion about preferences and safewords, and then it just works. I\ndon't know why, and I don't know how, but sometimes you find a partner who can just --\nread you, like an open book -- or who seems as transparent as glass to you; or, if you're\nreally lucky, both.\n(But I write about this with some hesitation, and I'm putting it at the end of this post after\ntwo other examples for a reason: because I don't think it's the standard, and I don't think it\nought to be seen as standard. Especially because, paradoxically, this kind of instinctive\nconnection will sometimes throw me off guard, make me unlikely to communicate when\nI probably ought to, because if he can read me that well -- it's so tempting to assume that\n\"he just knows\" everything. But of course he doesn't. I later had a couple rough moments\nwith that particular guy, where I didn't tell him about boundaries that were actually pretty\nimportant, because I thought he could just tell -- and of course he couldn't always \"just\ntell.\" Sometimes he could, but sometimes he couldn't.)\nThe overall moral of the story is this. Even with him, even with this guy, who totally\nblindsided me with his ability to read me despite the fact that he barely knew me: even\nwith him, I had to be able to talk directly about what I wanted. Our connection was\nestablished because I was able to say, \"Okay, that bite was a tad gentle, here's how I\nreally like it, and here's what not to do with your teeth on me.\" All my most\nextraordinary sexual connections have benefited from everyone involved taking\nownership of their desire, and talking about it directly at least a little bit.\nI occasionally come across people who ask me how they can get their partners to do\nBDSM without talking about it directly. While I appreciate and sympathize with both\ntheir need to do BDSM, and their anxiety about talking about it -- I just can't get behind\nthe premise of the question. The fantasy of a sexual relationship that is totally instinctive\nand perfect without any effort is just that -- a fantasy. And moreover, while you might be\nable to get some BDSM experiences without actually having a conversation about\nBDSM, direct sexual communication is not a threat to your sexual experiences -- it can\nimprove them.\nDo what you want, really, as long as it's consensual. If you want to have sex that's not\ncommunicative, that is your prerogative, as long as it's always consensual. (It's worth\nasking, though... are you so sure you can tell that it's consensual, if you don't talk about\nit?) Still. Learning how to talk about sex more directly and exactly might be hard or\nembarrassing or complicated, but it is seriously worth it. Not just BDSM; all sex.\nIt's so worth it.\n* * *\nThis post originally appeared at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/03/11/storytime-sex-communication-case-studies/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nFEMINISM:\n[theory] Towards My Personal Sex-Positive Feminist 101\nI wrote this in 2011, when I realized that I couldn't find a good Sex-Positive Feminist 101\nanywhere on the Internet. The original version contains a lot more links, including an\nevolving set of relevant links at the end.\n* * *\nTowards My Personal Sex-Positive Feminist 101\nThere's an aphorism from the early 1900s literary critic Andre Maurois: \"The difficult\npart in an argument is not to defend one's opinion but to know it.\" Even though I identify\nas an activist and genuinely want to make a real impact on the world based on my\nbeliefs... I often think that much of my blogging has been more an attempt to figure out\nwhat I believe, than to tell people what I believe. And sometimes, I fall into the trap of\nwanting to be consistent more than I want to understand what I really believe -- or more\nthan I want to empathize with other people -- or more than I want to be correct. We all\ngotta watch out for that.\nBut I'm getting too philosophical here. (Who, me?) The point is, I am hesitant to write\nsomething with a title like \"Sex-Positive 101,\" because not only does it seem arrogant\n(who says Clarisse Thorn gets to define Sex-Positive 101?) -- it also implies that my\nthoughts on sex-positivity have come to a coherent, standardized end. Which they\nhaven't! I'm still figuring things out, just like everyone else.\nHowever, lately I've been thinking that I really want to write about some basic ideas that\ninform my thoughts on sex-positive feminism. I acknowledge that I am incredibly\nprivileged (white, upper-middle-class, heteroflexible, cisgendered etc) and coming\nmostly from a particular community, the BDSM community; both of these factors inform\nand limit the principles that underpin my sex-positivity. I welcome ideas for Sex-Positive\nFeminism 101, links to relevant 101 resources, etc.\n* * *\nSome Central Sex-Positive Feminist Ideas, according to Clarisse Thorn\n1) Desire is complicated, and people are different. These ideas both seem basic and\nobvious to me as I write them, but I wanted to put them out there because I think they're\nuseful anchors for all the rest.\n2) Gender is not a binary, and gender cannot be determined by a person's outer\nappearance or behavior. Different people experience and display gender in a galaxy of\nways. No woman in the world is perfectly submissive, perfectly hourglass-shaped,\nperfectly kind, etc, although these are stereotypes commonly associated with women. No\nman in the world is perfectly dominant, perfectly confident, perfectly muscular, etc.\nWhile many people reduce the idea of a person's gender to whether they have a penis or a\nvagina, the existence of trans people and intersex people proves that this isn't a valid\napproach. Individual people have all kinds of qualities that are attributed to the \"other\"\ngender... and the concept of an \"other\" (or \"opposite\") gender is weird in itself, because\nwhy does one gender have to be the \"other,\" and what does that imply?\nAll this having been said, gender is frequently perceived as a binary, and many people fit\nthemselves into the possibly-arbitrary system of gender that currently exists. There are\nideas of \"men\" and \"women\" that are culturally understood, widely adopted, and socially\nenforced. Feminism has its roots in women resisting men's violent and social dominance,\nand in women resisting the cultural emphasis on stereotypical men's desires.\n3) Historically, sex has usually been defined in terms of two things: (a) reproduction,\nand (b) the sexual pleasure of stereotypical men. Cultural sexual standards are based\non these things. For example, the sexual \"base system\"; if you've read my work before\nthen you'll have seen me talk about it a lot, because it's such a perfect example. It's\ncommonly discussed among USA schoolchildren and it describes kissing as \"first base,\"\ngroping as \"second base,\" oral sex as \"third base\" and penis-in-vagina sex as \"home\nbase.\" Why should this hierarchy exist? It only makes sense if we think of sex as being\ncentered around reproduction. If we think of sex as being about pleasure and open\nexploration in ways that are different for everyone, then having a \"home base\" -- a\nstandardized goal -- makes zero sense.\nAnother example: penis-in-vagina sex is often seen as \"real\" sex or \"actual\" sex, with all\nother sex considered \"less real.\" How many arguments have you had over the course of\nyour lifetime about whether oral sex \"counts\" as sex? (Hint: more than the subject\ndeserves.) For a recent example, there's the Kink.com virgin shoot, wherein a porn model\npublicly \"lost her virginity\" notwithstanding the fact that she'd already had plenty of oral\nand anal sex on camera for years -- she'd just never had vaginal sex.\nAs for sex being defined by the pleasure of stereotypical men: one example is how people\nusually think about orgasms. In my experience and that of people I talk to -- and in the\nvast majority of porn -- it seems commonly accepted that sexual activity ends with a\nman's orgasm, whereas women are commonly expected to continue engaging in sex after\nhaving an orgasm... despite the fact that many women seem just as tired and lessinterested\nin sex post-orgasm as many men are. In part, this goes back to defining sex in\nterms of reproduction: men have to orgasm in order for reproduction to happen, so men's\norgasms must (supposedly) be central to sex. It's all influenced by these other\nconstructions, like how penis-in-vagina sex is \"real\" sex, or \"home base\": many people\nare confused by the idea that you'd shift sexual gears to (for example) manual stimulation\nif you've already \"made it to home base.\" But it also arises from centering stereotypical\nmen's desires -- from a culture that just generally sees them as more important, more\ndriving, and more necessary than women's. (Note that the majority of women don't\nachieve orgasm from penis-in-vagina sex in itself.)\nWhen sex is defined in terms of reproduction and stereotypical male pleasure, the\nfollowing things result:\n+ People who aren't men have a harder time understanding their sexuality, because there\nare fewer models (for example: it's fairly common for women to figure out how to have\norgasms much later in life than the average man -- like 20s or 30s, if ever)\n+ Men who don't fit masculine stereotypes have a harder time understanding their\nsexuality (for example: there's a great essay by a former men's magazine editor in the\nanthology Best Sex Writing 2010 in which he talks about how hard it was for him to come\nto terms with his desire for heavy women)\n+ Even men who do fit masculine stereotypes feel limited from other types of\nexploration, and may derive less pleasure from sex than they would in a less broken\nworld\n+ Sex acts or sexual relationships that aren't reproductive are devalued, are seen as weird,\nor aren't even defined as sex (for example: stigma against gay sex, lesbian sex, many\nfetishes, etc)\n4) Women are expected to trade sex to men in exchange for support or romance.\nWomen who don't get a \"good trade\" (e.g. women who don't receive a certain level of\nfinancial support or romance \"in exchange for\" sex) are seen as sluts. Men who don't get\na \"good trade\" (e.g. men who don't receive a certain amount of sex \"in exchange for\" a\nrelationship) are seen as pussies. (Yes, \"pussies\"... don't you just love that a word for\nfemale genitalia is a commonly used insult against so-called \"weak\" men?)\nWhat this also means is that many people have trouble examining motivations outside\nthis framework: women are always expected to be looking for more emotional or\nfinancial investment from a guy, whereas men are always expected to be looking for\nmore (or more so-called \"extreme\") sex. Women who actively seek sex, or men who\nactively seek intimacy, are shamed and hurt and confused for it -- often even within their\nown heads.\n5) Since stereotypical men have historically been much freer to explore their\nsexuality than people of other genders, the desires of stereotypical men have formed\nthe pattern for \"liberated sexuality.\" As women have won freedom to act, work and\nexplore outside the home more, we've been following patterns created mostly by men,\nand those patterns might look extremely different if women had created them.\nWhen we talk about sexuality, I think that leads us to examine what \"liberated sexuality\"\nlooks like. \"Liberated sexuality\" is often stereotyped as promiscuous, for example.\n\"Liberated sexuality\" is also stereotyped as being unromantic, never involving any of\nthose pesky pesky feelings, etc. I write about this cautiously: I have no intention of telling\nanyone what \"real\" men do or feel, or what \"real\" women do or feel. However, it seems\nconceivable to me that most men are generally more likely to enjoy promiscuity and\nemotionless sex than most women are -- if only for hormonal reasons. Here's a quotation\nfrom the brilliant trans man sex writer Patrick Califia on the effects of testosterone:\nIt's harder to track psychological and emotional changes caused by one's taking\ntestosterone than it is to notice the physical differences. But I think the former actually\noutweigh the latter. It isn't that testosterone has made me a different person. I always had\na high sex drive, liked porn and casual sex, couldn't imagine giving up masturbation, was\nable to express my anger, and showed a pretty high level of autonomy and assertiveness.\nBut all of these things have gotten much more intense since I began hormone treatments.\nDuring the first six months on T, every appetite I had was painfully sharp. A friend of\nmine expressed it this way: \"When I had to eat, I had to eat right fucking now. If I was\nhorny, I had to come immediately. If I needed to shit, I couldn't wait. If I was pissed off,\nthe words came right out of my mouth. If I was bored, I had to leave.\" My body and all\nthe physical sensations that spring from it have acquired a piquancy and an immediacy\nthat is both entertaining and occasionally inconvenient. Moving through the world is\neven more fun, involves more stimulation than it used to; life is more in the here-andnow,\nmore about bodies and objects, less about thoughts and feelings.\n… Casual sex has changed. When I want to get off, my priority is to find somebody who\nwill do that as efficiently as possible, and while I certainly would rather have a pleasant\ninteraction with that person, I don't think a lot about how they were doing before they got\ndown on their knees, and I don't care very much how they feel after they get up and\nleave. It's hard to keep their needs in mind; it's easier to just assume that if they wanted\nanything, it was their responsibility to try to get it. I always preferred to take sexual\ninitiative, and that has become even more ego-congruent. (pages 397-398, Speaking Sex\nTo Power)\nA trans woman friend once told me that not only did she get turned on more frequently\npre-transition; also, she now has to feel more emotionally connected to her partner in\norder to enjoy sex. And she noted that she has to \"take care of herself more\" in order to\nfeel turned on now -- not just in the moment, but in life, and in the relationship.\nIf we accept that there is, speaking generally, a difference in sexual desires between men\nand women (although individuals will always be unique), then it leads to new questions.\nIf women were socially and culturally dominant, what would so-called \"liberated\nsexuality\" look like? If people of all genders are following patterns set by stereotypical\nmen, then what does that mean for attempts to think around those patterns?\n6) Communicating consent is complicated, but consent is the only thing that makes\nsex okay, so we have to make every effort to respect it. All sex is completely fine with\nme as long as it's consensual. Seriously, I really don't care what you do -- as long as it's\nconsensual. (Try to find a consensual sex act that shocks me. I dare you.)\nCommunicating consent can, however, be complicated, and there are lots of different\nways to do it. Many BDSMers are eminently familiar with this, as you can tell by the fact\nthat some parts of the BDSM community have developed an extensive array of tactics for\ndiscussing consent. For example, the most famous BDSM communication tactic is\nsafewords, which gives everyone involved a clear word that they can invoke to stop the\naction at any time.\nMost people don't communicate directly about most things, and the stigma and high\nemotions around sexuality make it even harder for most people to communicate directly\nabout sex. Hence, most sexual communication is highly indirect. Even among people\nwho are accustomed to direct sexual communication -- like many BDSMers -- a lot of\ncommunication ends up being indirect and instinctive anyway; there's just no way to\ndiscuss every possible reaction and every single desire ahead of time. Everyone fucks up\nsometimes. No one in the world has a perfect track record on creating a pressure-free\nenvironment for their partners to express what they want... or asking their partners for\nwhat they want... or even knowing what they want in the first place.\nSo, yes, I acknowledge that communicating about sex and getting what you want\nconsensually can be really hard. However, it's most important to not violate people's\nboundaries. No matter how hard it is, it's necessary to make a serious and genuine effort\nto measure and respect a partner's consent every time sex happens. Feminist ideas of\nenthusiastic consent are designed to help this process.\nHere's my attempt at a quick definition of enthusiastic consent:\nThe basic idea is simple: don't initiate sex unless you have your partner's enthusiastic\nconsent. Not a partner who says, \"Okay, I guess,\" in a bored tone, but doesn't actively\nsay \"no.\" Not a partner who is silent and non-reactive, but doesn't actively stop you when\nyou start having sex with them. Not a partner who seems hesitant, or anxious, or\nconfused. Enthusiastic consent means an enthusiastic partner: one who is responding\npassionately, kissing you back, saying things like \"Yes\" or \"Oh my God, don't stop\"... or\na partner who talks to you ahead of time about what will happen, as many BDSMers and\nsex workers do, and knows how to safeword or otherwise get out of the situation if you do\nsomething they don't like.\nIt's worth noting that there are critiques within feminism of the concept of enthusiastic\nconsent. For example, some feminist sex workers point out that when they have sex for\nmoney, their consent is not exactly \"enthusiastic,\" but they still feel that their consent is\nreal consent, and that their choices must be respected. The same goes for some asexual\npeople. Asexuality is commonly defined as \"not feeling sexual attraction to others,\" but\nsome asexual people have romantic relationships with other people in which they have\nsex entirely to satisfy their partner, and some of them have said that they don't feel\nincluded by feminist discussions of enthusiastic consent.\nHey, even some of my non-asexual, non-sex worker friends have problems with the idea\nthat they aren't \"really\" consenting unless they're super-enthusiastic about the sexual act\nat hand. A married friend once commented wryly that if she and her husband always\ndemanded 100% enthusiastic consent from each other, then the marriage would fall apart.\nBut as we continued to discuss it, she and her husband both agreed that they have zero\nproblem with the situation as it stands.\nI don't want to sweep those critiques under the rug. I figure that as long as everyone's\ncommunicating about the situation openly, and working to keep things relatively lowpressure,\nthen consent is likely to happen, even if it's not perfectly \"enthusiastic.\" I've had\nextensive debates on the topic with other feminists, though, and I often seek more,\nbecause honing consent theory is one of my favorite things!\nAll this having been said: the concept of enthusiastic consent has been very helpful for\nme personally. I know that it's also been helpful for an enormous number of other people\nwho are trying to understand boundaries in their sexual relationships. I absolutely believe\nthat enthusiastic consent is an important and useful standard, and I do my best to observe\nthat standard as much as I can in my own relationships. So, while I think some critiques\nare reasonable, I also think that the idea of enthusiastic consent is the best baseline\nassumption to start these conversations... if not to end them.\n7) In practice, as long as everyone involved is having consensual fun, criticism is\nsecondary. Practically speaking, consent is the most important thing; from a pragmatic\nstandpoint, the question of whether sexuality arises from biology or culture doesn't matter\nnearly as much. (I find the question of whether BDSM can be categorized as a sexual\norientation to be more politically and theoretically interesting than practically important.)\nUnderstanding sexual biology or culture may help us grasp some of the complexities of\nconsent. For example, people often have trouble saying \"no\" to things directly: when was\nthe last time you explicitly said \"no\" when you didn't want to do something? Which of\nthe following exchanges is more likely:\nPerson A: Hey, want to come over tonight?\nPerson B: You know, I'd love to, but I'm so exhausted from work, I really need to get\nsome sleep.\nor\nPerson A: Hey, want to come over tonight?\nPerson B: No.\nPeople of all genders really don't like saying \"no\" to things directly. Grasping this\nimportant cultural concept is one step on the path of learning how to communicate\neffectively about consent. But in my book, it's really not as important to understand why\npeople hate saying \"no\" directly, as it is to understand that people hate saying \"no\"\ndirectly. It's necessary to understand that because it means that pushing someone until\nthey say \"no\" can mean pushing them further than they wanted to go.\nI believe that the most important role of social criticism -- including sex-positive\nfeminism -- is not to tell people what to do. If you have sex that appears to be in line with\nridiculous and oppressive stereotypes, I really do not care as long as everyone involved is\nconsenting and having fun. I reserve the right to occasionally have consensual sex where\na gentleman friend beats me up before fucking me, and I reserve the right to enjoy it.\nBut I want to offer sex-positive feminist analyses in order to help people understand\nthemselves and their desires... and also understand their partners and their desires. I think\nthat many people have sex they don't like, sex that's in line with ridiculous and oppressive\nstereotypes, because they haven't been exposed to anything they like better. I think many\npeople have sex they don't like because they don't feel like they can look for something\ndifferent -- they think it's the best they can get. I think many people have sex they don't\nlike because they think it's what their partner wants -- and I think those people are\nfrequently wrong, and I think most partners would genuinely prefer that everyone be\nhaving fun.\nWhich is why I try to deconstruct sexual norms and stereotypes. Which is why I\nencourage people to look for what they like. Which is why I always emphasize talking\nabout it.\n8) Awesome, respectful, joyful, mutual sex means approaching sex as collaborative\nrather than adversarial. Aside from solo sex (i.e. masturbation), sex always involves\nanother person. And at its best, it's about having a good time with other people --\nunderstanding their reality, accepting it, playing with it. The best metaphors I've ever\nheard for sex were all about collaborative art, like a musical jam performance. Here's a\nbit from Thomas MacAulay Millar's totally brilliant essay \"Towards a Performance\nModel of Sex\" (please do read the whole thing someday):\nThe negotiation is the creative process of building something from a set of available\nelements. Musicians have to choose, explicitly or implicitly, what they are going to play:\ngenre, song, key and interpretation. The palette available to them is their entire skill set\n-- all the instruments they have and know how to play, their entire repertoire, their\nimagination and their skills -- and the product will depend on the pieces each individual\nbrings to the performance. Two musicians steeped in Delta blues will produce very\ndifferent music from one musician with a love for soul and funk and another with roots in\nhip-hop or 1980s hardcore. This process involves communication of likes and dislikes\nand preferences, not a series of proposals that meet with acceptance or rejection.\n… Under this model, the sexual interaction should be creative, positive, and respectful\neven in the most casual of circumstances.\n(\"Towards a Performance Model of Sex\" was first printed in Yes Means Yes, edited by\nJessica Valenti and Jaclyn Friedman, the brilliant sex-positive anti-rape anthology that I\nwant everyone in the entire world to read. It was also reprinted in Best Sex Writing 2010,\nedited by Rachel Kramer Bussel.)\n9) All people deserve equal rights, including sexual minorities. As long as people are\nhaving consensual sex, they do not deserve to be stigmatized, harassed, or otherwise\nharmed for their sexuality. Period. No one should be fired for their sexual or gender\nidentity. No one should have their kids taken away for their sexual or gender identity.\nRape is still rape, even when it's perpetrated against a sex worker. I support\ndecriminalizing sex work for a lot of reasons; for example, I'd love it if the law would\nquit harassing and jailing sex workers for having consensual sex, and I'd love it if sex\nworkers could organize for better workplace safety. The bottom line is that people -- all\npeople -- have rights. It's time to treat them that way.\n* * *\nIn terms of actual ways to be sex-positive in everyday life, here are the three ways I\nusually encourage people to spread the sex-positive love:\nA) Avoid re-centering. Sexuality shouldn't be societally \"centered\" on any particular\nnorm, idea, or stereotype (except consent). It is frequently tempting to re-center\n\"objective\" ideas about sexuality onto ourselves, if we're different from the norm, or onto\npeople we admire. But the truth is that -- on a societal level -- queer sex is just as\nawesome as straight sex; that BDSM sex is equally admirable as vanilla sex; that\ncisgendered people are not any more or less amazing than trans people. The decision to\nhave sex is no better than the decision to avoid sex, and asexual people are just as great as\nhypersexual people who are just as great as anyone with any level of sex drive.\nIn alternative sexuality subcultures, one often encounters a kind of superior attitude,\nperhaps because we have to push back so hard against the norm. In polyamory, for\nexample, some of us use the sarcastic term \"polyvangelist\": a person who insists that\npolyamory is \"better\" or \"more evolved\" or \"makes more sense\" for everyone,\neverywhere, than monogamy does. Neither monogamy nor polyamory is better than the\nother; they're just different. Polyvangelists are trying to re-center onto polyamory. Not\ncool.\nB) Start conversations. One of the most damaging problems around sexuality is the\noverwhelming and constant stigma. It hurts people with certain sexual identities,\npreferences or pasts. It hurts them spiritually. It can hurt them societally, like when\nLGBTQ folks have difficulty adopting children, or former sex workers are not allowed to\nwork at other jobs. It can even hurt them physically: 40 years after doctors started\nnoticing the HIV pandemic, too many people are still refusing to talk about sex openly, or\ngive healthcare to sexual minorities directly affected by HIV. To say nothing of people\nwho are attacked or killed for their sexual minority status, like trans people who are\nmurdered in the street, or lesbians who are raped in order to \"fix\" their sexuality. Sexual\nstigma kills.\nSo when someone says something icky about sex and gender, or stereotypes a certain sex\nor gender identity, it's so great to challenge them -- or at least to question them. (\"Really?\nWhat makes you think all gay people are abuse survivors?\") And some of the most\npowerful sex activism out there involves starting discussion groups, creating venues for\ndiscussion, hosting sexuality speakers or sex-related art, etc.\nC) Be \"out\" or open, without being invasive. This can be tricky, because I don't want\nto encourage people to aggressively talk about sex at totally inappropriate times -- and\nagain, I'm against re-centering. On the other hand, the most powerful tool for\ndestigmatizing sexuality appears to be coming out of the closet -- whether a person is\nqueer, BDSM, or whatever. Openly acknowledging, owning, and discussing your sexual\npreferences can help others respect those preferences -- and can help others who share\nthose preferences respect themselves. (Can you tell that I cried when I saw the movie\nMilk?)\n* * *\nThis post can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/05/08/towards-my-personal-sex-positive-feminist-\n101/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nS&M:\n[theory] S&M Superpowers\nI wrote this post in 2011, but I encountered the \"superpower\" framework for fetishes in\n2008, before I started blogging. I was telling one of my first S&M partners about how\nbroken and anxious I felt, and he said: \"Why talk about it that way? You haven't lost\nanything. You've gained a superpower!\"\n* * *\nS&M Superpowers\nI've gotten so bored of the biases and stereotypes against S&M. It's like, \"Hey, another\nperson who implies that those of us who do consensual S&M were all abused as\nchildren? Sweet! That person is wrong, and I consider those views highly stigmatizing\nand sometimes damaging. So, can we go for a swim now?\"\n(For the record, the biggest and best-designed study ever done on this topic surveyed\n20,000 people and found that S&Mers \"were no more likely to have been coerced into\nsexual activity\" than the general population. But -- also for the record -- an S&Mer whose\nsexuality was associated with being abused would not be \"less legitimate\" than the rest of\nus, as long as that person practiced kink consensually. Because what makes S&M okay is\nconsent, right? Right. S&M isn't okay or not okay because of its \"source,\" whatever that\nmight be -- it's okay only when it's practiced consensually, right? Right. So this is all\nactually kind of a silly conversation to have in the first place, right? Right. It's too bad\nstigma tends to make zero sense, isn't it? Stigma loves to trick you into debating on its\nown terms.)\nIt's much more entertaining to imagine how people would talk about S&M, if we lived in\na culture where S&M wasn't wildly stigmatized. In fact, what if S&M were admired or\nseen as a great thing... instead of being repressed and forced underground and seen as a\ndark, evil, disgusting thing? I've known people who called S&M and other fetishes\n\"superpowers,\" in a kind of ironic twist on this concept.\nMany people have written about how S&Mers can offer lessons in sexuality that we\ngleaned from our outside-the-box perspective (there's a whole paper on this topic for\nclinicians, written by psychologist Peggy Kleinplatz and titled \"Learning from\nExtraordinary Lovers\"). I myself have talked about how S&Mers tend to use much more\ncareful and precise sexual communication tactics than the mainstream (examples include\nchecklists and safewords). But these lessons are hardly confined to S&Mers -- there are\nlots of vanilla people out there who are awesomely careful and precise about\ncommunicating sexually.\nThe superpower framework is a bit different....\n+ For example, I already noted that it's been demonstrated that S&Mers are not more\nlikely to have endured non-consensual acts -- so we know that despite what Freud would\nhave had you believe, all S&M does not arise from childhood abuse. But maybe it does\narise from a childhood experience... an awesome childhood experience. Maybe the\nMissing S&M Link is that something totally wonderful happened to S&Mers in our\nchildhoods.\nHey, vanilla people? I'm so sorry you all had such bad childhoods. Really, you have my\nsincerest sympathies.\n+ For example, some folks will say that we S&Mers have a wire crossed somewhere;\nsome genetic inferiority. But maybe we are totally way superior. Maybe average\ndominants and sadists are, say, more empathic than the norm. (There is, after all, actual\nresearch showing that consensual S&M increases intimacy.) Maybe average submissives\nand masochists are better at processing pain and enduring challenges, both physical and\nemotional, than the norm.\nSorry vanilla people, but we're going to have to start screening for your gross vanilla\ngenes in the womb. Nothing personal.\n+ For example, one of my exes has a story about how he was down in Latin America and\nhe only had access to incredibly cold showers. So he gritted his teeth, stepped into the\nshower, and told himself that a dominant woman was forcing him to take it. \"Actually it\nmade the shower a million times easier to deal with,\" he said later. \"And I had a raging\nerection the whole time.\"\nAren't submissives awesome? I pity those of you who lack submissive tendencies.\nJust because anything on the Internet can and will be misread, I will conclude this post by\nhammering down the point that this is all a thought experiment, and I do not actually\nthink vanilla people are any less wonderful than S&M people. It's okay vanilla folks.\nI love you just the way you are.\n* * *\nThis post can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/06/21/sm-superpowers/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nS&M:\n[theory] BDSM Can Be \"Love Sex\" Too\nIn early 2011, my fellow sex blogger Rachel Rabbit White asked me to participate in her\ninitiative \"Lady Porn Day.\" This was the result. There's a list of relevant links at the end\nof the online version of this article.\n* * *\nBDSM Can Be \"Love Sex\" Too\nI'm not a big porn consumer, but I have no problem with porn in itself. When I have a\nproblem with porn, it's because I have a problem with how it was made: because there are\nlabor issues, or questions of the actors' consent. Sometimes, I get frustrated with the\ncontext in which porn exists or the stereotypes it expresses -- but there, the problem is\nwith the context and the stereotypes, not with porn in itself. I tend to think that most antiporn\nanxiety arises from irrational grossed-out reactions and stereotype-created fears, and\nI try to open up conversations about the ethics of making porn whenever I can.\nThis isn't to say I don't get angry because many people in our society are pressured to\nhave sex that doesn't work for them -- but that's not the fault of porn. I certainly get\nfrustrated by sexual stereotypes, but I don't think porn created those stereotypes.\nOne stereotype I've been thinking about a lot lately -- one that I see expressed over and\nover in BDSM porn -- is the idea that BDSMers don't love our partners, or that love can't\nbe part of a BDSM relationship. Here's a quotation from Pat Califia's Speaking Sex To\nPower that touches on this (note: contains spoilers about the endings of three famous\nBDSM novels -- Story of O, Return to the Chateau and Nine And A Half Weeks):\nI still remember how crushed I was when I read Story of O and Return to the Chateau\nand came to the ending, where Sir Stephen loses interest in O and tells her to kill herself.\nI can also remember being furious with the way Nine And A Half Weeks (the book, not\nthe movie) ends. The submissive woman has a public breakdown. She begins to cry\nhysterically, and is abandoned by her master, so that strangers have to obtain help for\nher. One of the cruelest stereotypes of S/M people is that we don't love each other, that\nthere is something about our sexual style that makes our relationships mutually\ndestructive and predisposes us to suicide.\nThis quotation came to mind during a conversation I had a few days ago: I was talking to\na girl who really likes BDSM sex but referred to non-BDSM sex as \"love sex.\" Because,\nyou know, love is just not an ingredient in BDSM sex. \"Everyone knows\" that -- the same\nway \"everyone knows\" that BDSM always arises from childhood abuse, or dominant\nsadism is for villains, or everyone who likes BDSM is damaged and miserable and\nirresponsible, or....\nNot to put too fine a point on it: fuck that.\nI'm not saying there's no BDSM smut out there with love in it. Anne Rice's Beauty series\nends with Beauty riding off into the sunset with her loving sadomasochistic partner\n(although of course the characters deal with all kinds of uncaring brutality first). But even\nnuanced BDSM erotica seems to fall into this trap more often than not -- for example,\nJacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Dart, which is so consciously written that it includes\nsafewords, also portrays a main character whose most compelling BDSM relationships\nare with her enemies and whose love relationship is with a man who can't stand to hurt\nher. (Carey took a very different tack later in the series, with other characters; I've always\nwondered whether she did so as a reaction to criticism.)\nIt's easier to criticize than create. And all my porn critiques could come back and bite me\nsoon, because I plan on releasing my own BDSM smut sometime... and I'm sure that what\nI produce won't even be close to perfect. Yet one thing I really want to ensure I represent\nin whatever I write is love. There are plenty of BDSM fantasies that partly operate on the\nabsence of love -- that even demand it, perhaps because the fantasy is all about a vicious\nand emotionally distant dominant, or because much of the erotic tension is derived from\nhow much the partners hate each other, or for lots of other reasons. And yeah, they're hot\nin their own way....\nBut it'd be so great if those weren't the standard.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/02/22/ladypornday-bdsm-can-be-love-sex-too/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nS&M:\n[theory] Body Chemistry and S&M\nThis was originally published in 2011. I don't normally write basic \"how-to\" posts like\nthis, but every once in a while I see a gap I just have to fill.\n* * *\nBody Chemistry and S&M\nI often think that good physical health is a widely-ignored element of good sex. I am\nobviously not saying that people in poor health can't have good sex (and in fact, I\ncertainly hope they do -- more power to 'em). But it consistently amazes me how much\nmy physical health factors into my sexuality, especially S&M. I am by no means an\nexpert on this topic, but here are some examples:\n* Food. I am both less interested in sex and in S&M when I'm hungry; ensuring that I've\neaten well before I take some punishment is especially crucial. I try to eat well in general,\nbut if I'm planning to have a heavy S&M encounter, I don't cut myself any slack. I try to\nspecifically ensure that I eat enough protein before the date and I try to include some\nvitamin-heavy foods like beets, leafy green vegetables, etc. Eggs are a good source of\nprotein; nuts, beans and tofu are my primary protein sources. If I don't have enough\nprotein available for whatever reason, I at least eat enough food that I won't be hungry\nwhen I see my partner.\nPart of the reason I'm writing this right now is that I've had trouble finding useful\nresources on the Internet for what people recommend as good pre- or post-S&M food,\nespecially during aftercare. \"Aftercare\" is an S&M term for how people end their S&M\nencounters. One excellent page on aftercare describes it thusly:\nAftercare is the last act of the SM drama. It is the culmination, the pulling together of all\nloose ends, the finishing touches, the final communion between sharers of the SM ritual,\nthe phase where the participants (usually the tops) formally give the fantasy scene a\ncontext in everyday reality. Its technical purpose is to transition both players from the\nelevated states created in a scene [i.e., an S&M encounter] back into normalcy,\nreturning to the motor control and awareness they will need to drive home once the\nscene is over. But as any good SM practitioner will tell you, it's much more than that. It\nis the time after the action when the participants come together in mutual affirmation\nthat something special was created and shared. It is when affection and closeness is\noffered and sought. It is, at very least, the proper time to express thanks to the person\nwho has shared this tiny segment of your life with you. It can be, and often is, the most\nbeautiful part of a scene, and it is part of the scene. To skip it altogether is as rude as\nhaving dinner at a friend's house and then bolting once you've eaten your fill.\nA lot of tops keep food and water on hand to give bottoms at the end of a scene, which I\nthink is probably a good idea. (Eating post-scene doesn't feel necessary for me as a\nbottom, but it might if I weren't so careful about what I eat beforehand.) Some people say\nthat fruit or fruit juice is the way to go -- and indeed, it will give the bottom's system a\nsugar boost and may make them feel better for that reason -- but I would personally rather\neat a protein bar, and I have some friends who feel the same way. Dungeons usually serve\nsnacks, although the snacks aren't always very healthy.\nA final note on food: I know there are people who specifically include food deprivation\nas part of their S&M. Obviously, this is totally fine by me as long as it is consensual, but\nI'd encourage people not to expect themselves -- or their partners -- to react the way they\nusually do to S&M, as long as they're hungry.\n* Weight. I used to be much scrawnier than I am now, and as my health has improved,\nI've gained weight. Sometimes this freaks me out (it's impossible to be female in our\nsociety and not daydream about having cheekbones that can stab people), but it has been\nworth it. One time, after I'd been having a lot of anxiety about weight gain, my thenboyfriend\nemailed me the image of an art card printed with the words, \"I gained 30\npounds... & sex has never been better!\" He perceptively wrote: \"Maybe that's why it's\neasier for you to have orgasms now? I think you should investigate this if you try to lose\nweight.\"\nI am not in a position to comment about whether being overweight affects sex. But I can\ndefinitely assure you that being underweight is not good for your sexual well-being.\n* Sleep. I much prefer to have S&M encounters on days when I've gotten a lot of sleep\nthe night before; this is at least as crucial as eating well before an encounter. There are\napproximately a billion studies that show the far-reaching effects that getting enough\nsleep can have on our health, and they seem to usually recommend around 7-8 hours as a\ngood amount per night (more for teenagers).\nAs with food, I know there are people who include sleep deprivation as part of their S&M\nencounters. Again, this is obviously fine by me as long as it is consensual, but I'd\nencourage people not to expect themselves -- or their partners -- to react the way they\nusually do to S&M, as long as they're tired. I don't know about you, but exhaustion\ncertainly makes me erratic and overly emotional. If you're going to be doing something\nlike S&M that can specifically create an erratic and overly emotional state... well, when\noverlapping that with exhaustion, it just seems like a good idea to be careful.\n* Alcohol. Alcohol definitely decreases my pain tolerance (quite dramatically in fact),\nand it definitely makes it harder for me to get turned on. There is only one bonus to\nalcohol, and that's the famous \"social lubricant\" effect. I personally prefer to limit myself\nto one glass of wine, maaaaybe two, if I'm planning to hook up with someone; in general,\nstone-cold sobriety is my preferred state to go into S&M. Good S&M makes me high\nenough on its own.\nI get the impression that some people get drunk before they do S&M because otherwise\nthey feel too anxious to do S&M. As always, I'm not going to tell other people that they\nshouldn't do consensual things... but drunkenness frequently makes it hard to\ncommunicate and hard to know what's going on in your head, which means that\ndrunkenness makes consent hard. Not impossible, just hard. Be careful.\nA lot of people say that mixing substances and BDSM is always bad. Personally, I figure\nthat if a person has a lot of experience with a given substance, and a lot of experience\nwith a given BDSM act, and a lot of experience with their partner... then I kind of doubt\nthey're taking a huge risk by doing a familiar BDSM act with a familiar partner in a\nfamiliar state of mind. It's a lot to deal with at once, and again, it's worth being careful.\nAnd of course, substance abuse problems are a whole nother ballgame. But if a person\nhas been drinking a glass of wine with dinner every night for 10 years, then I'm not going\nto tell her that I consider her incapable of doing BDSM after dinner.\nI am not qualified to comment on non-alcohol drugs because I, of course, never do\nanything illegal. But for all your drug-related questions, the website Erowid.org is often\nvery useful.\n* Illness. I don't have any particular observations about how being sick changes my\nexperience of S&M, but it definitely does. When I get sick and I have the option to\nreschedule a date, I always do.\n* Aaand finally, menstrual cycle. I haven't tracked my cycle with enough care to know\nexactly how it affects me S&M-wise, but I'm pretty sure it does. As one of the good\npeople at EduKink once observed, \"The great part about playing with a woman is that\nyou have 28 different partners, one for each day of the month!\"\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/01/30/body-chemistry-and-sm/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nS&M:\n[theory] Going Under\nThis was originally published in 2011. People have asked me whether there's any actual\nresearch out there on the altered states that some people access through S&M; as far as\nI know, there isn't. It's also worth noting that a lot of dominant partners go into another\nkind of \"zone\" that's sometimes called top-space.\n* * *\nGoing Under\n\"Come back,\" an S&M partner said softly, the other day, pushing my hair out of my eyes.\nI blinked and shook my head in a futile attempt to clear it.\n\"That's weird,\" I said. \"Someone else used to say those words to me when I was coming\nout of subspace. I... that's weird.\"\n\"I'm not surprised,\" he said. \"It's a natural thing to say to you. You go under so fast, and\nso deep. You're so far away.\"\n\"Not all the time,\" I said. \"And not with everyone. You're good at putting me there.\"\nHe smiled. \"You bring it out in me.\"\nSubspace is so hard to describe. I've written about it before, in passing, so many times,\nbecause it's so important, but I've never come up with a good description for it; and when\nI Google for it I can see that other people have the same problem. When I'm starting to go\ninto subspace it's just soft and dark and slow. But when I'm really far under, I'm totally\nblank. Falling. Flying.\nSomewhere else.\nCome back.\nWhat is it, where do I go? It's just submissive, masochist headspace. But I don't always\nget into subspace when I submit, and I don't always get into it when I take pain either. I'm\nnot sure what the other ingredients are: some amount of trust, of course. And strong\nfeelings about my partner make everything more intense... way more intense. Orders of\nmagnitude more intense. Still, I've had new partners put me under with surprising\nthoroughness.\nIt's a lot like deep sexual arousal -- hard to think, hard to process, hard to make decisions\n-- but the deepest sexual arousal does not put me anywhere near deep subspace. Deep\nsubspace is. More. Than anything else.\nSome S&M teachers tell people not to drive after an S&M encounter, not for a while; not\nuntil you're over the subspace. They compare it to an altered state, like being drunk.\nSome S&M teachers caution that it's dangerous for the dominant partner to suggest a new\nactivity in the middle of an S&M encounter -- something that wasn't negotiated\nbeforehand -- because the submissive may not be able to think clearly enough to consent.\n(And because in those moments, the submissive will have a harder time than ever saying\nno.)\nI sometimes think that when I was younger and less experienced, I abandoned myself to\nsubspace more easily. I'm better at pulling myself out of subspace now, but I think the\ncost may be that it's harder for me to really get into it. (Safety first?) I trained myself to\nbe able to say, \"Don't stop,\" when I wanted my partner to keep going. (Sound easy? Trust\nme, it took a while.) Playing with unfamiliar partners, I trained myself to be on guard.\n(One of my sex worker friends told me once, \"I don't care how deep the subspace is, I can\nalways come out if the client tries to fuck me without a condom.\") I got better at calling\nmy safeword before I had to -- asking my partner to do something else or give me a\nbreak, rather than suddenly stopping everything once I hit my absolute limit.\nI am nowhere near perfect, of course. In particular, I can rarely answer complicated\nquestions, and sometimes my partners literally can't get me to answer any questions\nwhen I'm subspaced. Sometimes it takes me a long time to come out, and partners may\nget nervous while I'm surfacing. But I'm not sure these aspects can actually be eliminated\nfrom subspace. And I've gotten better.\nI'm sure that in an emergency, I could talk and function straight out of heavy subspace. I\ndoubt I would be optimally intelligent and thoughtful, however.\nWhen I was younger, I'd get frustrated with my partner if he tried to ask me questions or\nclarify things or otherwise check in with me when I was in subspace. Damn it, can't you\nsee I'm not here? Can't you see I'm under? Don't drag me back -- Intellectually, I\nunderstood that my frustration was unreasonable, and I did my best to train myself to deal\nwith the check-ins. To surface quickly, slip back under afterwards. But I had to\nexperience subspace from the dominant side before I understood how hard it was to deal\nwith.\nI remember sitting with my arms around the submissive and occasionally asking him how\nhe was; in response, he would murmur and snuggle up to me. Ten minutes. Twenty\nminutes. I was processing my own dominant experience, and I had questions; I'd\noccasionally ask one. He'd murmur something softly. After a while I really wanted a\nglass of water and I thought he'd basically fallen asleep, so I said, \"Hey, I'm going to go\nget a glass of water, okay?\" and tried to move away.\n\"No,\" he cried, and grabbed me. Holy shit, I thought, so that's what surfacing from\nsubspace can look like from the outside. Suddenly I understood exactly where his head\nwas at: barely any time had passed for him at all, and he was still drifting up through\nvelvety layers of consciousness. When I tried to leave, he'd felt sudden panic, a shot of\npure abandonment, no no no you can't, you can't leave me alone when I'm like this,\nplease I need your arms around me, I need you --\nI knew exactly what to tell him. \"Shh,\" I said, \"I'm here.\"\nA dominant friend once told me that he always informs his partners ahead of time that he\nhas to move after a good scene, he has to go for a run, and he won't stick around to guide\nthem out of subspace. I've always wondered how his partners deal with it. Maybe it's\neasier if you know it's coming.\nThere are questions of consent, of negotiating new activities while a partner's in\nsubspace. Some people have told me they can't even actually safeword when they're in\ndeep subspace; I can't quite relate to this, but I imagine it could happen sometime. I\nmyself have occasionally had trouble safewording in the past, but it wasn't ever just\nbecause of subspace, it was because of pride or difficult emotions with the dominant\npartner. Subspace did complicate things, but I don't think it was the reason I had trouble\n(though it can be hard to disentangle these things). But maybe someday I'll go under so\nfar that it will be.\nI'm not saying it's never okay to push further than you discussed, once they're under -- it's\njust important to be careful, and not to do it unless you're pretty sure you can read your\npartner... or that they have the emotional wherewithal to deal with it if you push too hard.\nBecause safety in subspace is a question of emotional safety, more than anything. The\nvulnerability and intimacy in those moments can be terrifying. The tiniest change in his\ntone can mean the difference between mindless fear and absolute trust. It's so scary, and\nso intoxicating, and so weirdly unexplainably glorious.\nCome back.\nThe best part might actually be coming back.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/04/22/going-under/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nORGASMIC \"DYSFUNCTION\":\n[storytime] A Unified Theory of Orgasm\nAt one point during my blogging career, an editor for the iconic feminist publication Ms.\nMagazine got in touch and asked me to do some promotion for them. I asked if they\nwould accept a submission from me, and when the editor said yes, I poured my soul into\nthis long article about my experiences learning how to have an orgasm. The article was\nrejected by Ms., so I went back to my old friend the Internet and got published on the\nadorable girl-power site OffOurChests.com. Then it was cross-posted in about a million\nplaces. I would love to get published in Ms., but in retrospect, I'm actually glad that this\npiece went out on the Internet instead of being trapped in a print publication. I've\nreceived an enormous amount of positive feedback for this piece, and I'm certain that\nmost of the young people who tell me it helped them would never have seen it if it were in\na print magazine.\n* * *\nA Unified Theory of Orgasm\nI CAN'T COME.\nand it's poisoned\nevery romance\nI've ever had.\nmasturbating doesn't work. I don't know why. I tried therapy too, but my smart,\nunderstanding, sex-positive, open-hearted doctor couldn't help. drugs while fucking?\ncheck. I date attentive men who only want to make me happy, but no matter how fantastic\nthey make me feel, I can't get off. and believe me, I like sex. I love sex! how can it feel so\ngood and not end in an orgasm? I tried experimenting, and I sure do love the kink. it\nfeels great. but doesn't get me off. I've tried everything. everything.\nnow I have the best boyfriend I've ever had. but just like every other one, he can't get me\noff. big dick? oral sex? tons of foreplay? kink? it's all there. nothing works. I used to lie\nto my boyfriends and say it was ok that I couldn't get off. then at least they could enjoy\nsex without feeling guilty. but then they'd stop trying, of course. and this one is still\ntrying... sometimes. I mean, it's clearly never going to work. so I can't blame him for not\nhaving the same passion for trying as he used to. and I keep thinking I should back off.\nafter all, why put pressure on him to \"perform\"? he'll just resent me if I keep asking for\nmore, even if I'm gentle about it and compliment him and all that. since nothing he does\nworks. it will never work.\nand I try so hard not to get frustrated, but I can't avoid the knowledge that I am fucked\nup, I must be broken.

Vaginal Pain\nWhen I wrote the above, I was actually pretty close to figuring out how to have an\norgasm. But I didn't know that. I'd dealt with the anxiety of being unable to come for so\nlong -- and I'd also recently begun to understand that my sexuality is oriented towards\nS&M -- and so anguish just flooded out of me, into those words. I craved S&M, but\nacknowledging the craving made me feel like a \"pervert,\" a \"freak.\" It contributed to my\nalready-overwhelming fear that I was \"broken\" because I couldn't figure out how to\ncome.\nThere's one thing I didn't mention when I poured out all that fear and shame: I experience\nrare vaginal pain -- not every time I have sex, not even most times, but occasionally.\nMedical science has traditionally failed to care about how women experience our\nsexuality, so very little research has been done on the subject. As a result, it's impossible\nto say why I get that pain. Is it some kind of physical problem? That seems likely,\nbecause my psychological comfort level with a sexual encounter doesn't seem to correlate\nwith whether the pain happens or not. But because female sexuality is often stereotyped\nas too mysterious and emotional to be worth rigorous medical investigation, I doubt I'll\never know for sure.\nFor a while I was sure I was allergic to semen, because I read a magazine feature by a\nwoman who said she was. Aha, I thought. I stopped taking hormonal birth control pills. I\nmade my trusted monogamous boyfriends use condoms. The pain became less common.\nYet throughout that time -- continuing through today -- I still get the pain occasionally,\nvery occasionally. Sometimes I even feel the pain during encounters that lack vaginal\npenetration, so it's clearly not about having a penis in me.\nI can push through the pain; I can even have an orgasm, a reflex that feels good yet is\nsurrounded by not-good; but I can't get rid of the pain entirely. Whenever I think I'll\nnever feel it again, it sneaks into some sexual encounter.\nThe semen allergy theory has been ruled out, since I get the pain without semen contact.\nThat doesn't mean that hormonal birth control didn't have an effect, though -- the pain\nwas definitely worse while I was taking it. The Pill intersects with sexuality in ways we\nstill don't understand; one common side effect is that it reduces sex drive. Perhaps the Pill\naffected my sexuality in some physical-medical way, worsening the pain problem.\nThe long and the short of it is that I experience some vaginal pain; the pain is confusing\nand hard to predict, and there aren't any good medical resources on the matter. Maybe the\npain points to something unusual about my constitution. Maybe there's a reason it's\nharder for me to have orgasms than the \"average\" woman.\nBut the vaginal pain itself is not overwhelming, on the rare occasions that it crops up.\nAnd the vaginal pain is not even close to the most central issue of my sexuality -- or the\nbiggest influence on my orgasmic ability.\n* * *\nII. S&M\nI identify my sexuality as BDSM -- a.k.a. kink, leather, fetish, S&M, or B&D. BDSM is a\n6-for-4 acronym that encompasses a host of related activities, including bondage,\ndiscipline, dominance, submission, sadism and masochism. And yeah, I'm really into it:\nmy desires are heavy and overwhelming; I dream of agony, of terrified screams for\nmercy. I've gone so far as to describe BDSM as my sexual orientation.\nBefore someone goes leaping to conclusions, there is a definite difference between \"good\npain\" and \"bad pain.\" The occasional pain I feel within my vagina is not good pain; it's\nnot even interesting. It's just annoying. It's not sexy or enjoyable at all.\nSome of us in the BDSM community have felt lifelong tendencies towards BDSM. We\nhave conversations ending with thrilled exclamations: \"You mean, you tied up your\nBarbie dolls as a child too?!\" But BDSM is widely misunderstood and negatively\nstereotyped, and thus, many of us also went through periods of rejection. We've\ninternalized so much anti-BDSM stigma from society that, at times, we freak out. We\ndeny or erase our BDSM desires.\nThat's what happened to me when I was in middle school. As my sexuality made itself\nmore and more evident, my anxiety peaked. I'd been producing secret sadomasochistic art\nand stories without labeling what I was doing, but I stopped. I blockaded my thoughts of\nviolent power-play. I closed it all away as thoroughly as I could.\nI still felt sexual desire -- I mean, I was entering my teens, so of course I did. Sometimes I\nfelt so much desire, like in the middle of some inconvenient class, that I'd have to rest my\nburning forehead on the cold desk. I would close my eyes, and breathe deeply, and wait\nfor the erotic shiver to pass. At home, I'd lie around my twin bed and dream about kisses;\nimagine men's hair and skin and touch.\nYet it was hard for me to trace my desire, to take control of it. I thought I had no problem\nwith the idea of masturbation, but when I touched my own lady bits, I went cold.\nVibrators did nothing but bore me.\nI had excellent sex education, thank goodness. I went through a Unitarian Universalist\nsex education program that talked carefully about different experiences, that made space\nfor gay and lesbian and bisexual and transgender and queer folks. I didn't only learn\nabout sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy and condom usage; I was also\nencouraged to explore my sexuality, to value it. But this marvelous curriculum did not\ninclude BDSM and other non-standard sexual identities. Nor did it include much advice\non how to negotiate sexual encounters with my partners. So, although I internalized many\npositive and feminist messages about sex, my own sexuality remained invisible,\nbewildering and hard to talk about.\nWhen I started having sex around my mid-teens, I liked it -- I liked it a lot -- but it\nseemed weirdly lacking. I'd never figured out how to masturbate, so I couldn't show my\npartners how to pleasure me. And although I occasionally suspected that I wanted\nsomething like S&M, I didn't understand how far I wanted to go.\nA couple of teenage boyfriends tied me up... but then they acted solicitous and went\ndown on me, which didn't send me over the moon (though it was fun). From this, I\nconcluded that S&M was boring, but the truth is, I hadn't come close to the extremes that\nform my preferences. It was years later that I released my need for agony, tears, bruises\nand blood.\n* * *\nIII. Frigid\nAs I got older and had more sex, my apparent inability to orgasm became the most toxic\nsecret I had. Most of my closest friends didn't know. For a while I thought I must be\n\"frigid,\" and ripped myself apart over the idea that I was a \"frigid bitch,\" even though that\nmade no sense. It was ridiculous to conceptualize myself that way -- my sexual desire\nwas undeniable, unavoidable. But I had no other words, no other images or stereotypes,\nthat described a pre-orgasmic woman.\nWhen I did tell my friends, it almost never went well. The best-case scenario was a\nconversation with anecdotal fragments: \"I knew a girl,\" one friend advised, \"who couldn't\nhave orgasms. Then one day she was tripping, and having sex, and she fell asleep, and\nwhen she woke up she was having an orgasm.\"\nI also found a book on my father's top shelf, written by a guy who said he could give\n\"any\" girl a squirting orgasm. The author claimed that the key was for the woman to be\ncomfortable. He also claimed that the woman had to not know what he was trying to do.\nIn fact, the book explicitly recommended that men prevent their girlfriends from reading\nit.\nNeedless to say, it was hard to extrapolate a Unified Orgasm Theory from these tales.\nThe only things that seemed clear were that I somehow needed to both \"let go\" and to\n\"keep trying.\" But how?\nEvery once in a while I made the mistake of telling someone who was convinced they\nknew the answer -- which was: sleep with them. When I got drunk with one sexually\nexperienced male friend and asked for advice, he insisted that if I'd just fuck him I'd be\nsure to come. \"Anytime you want,\" he slurred, \"I'll give you an orgasm. Guaranteed!\"\nThe fact that I was not attracted to him was, in his view, unimportant.\nWorse was my lesbian female friend who declared that I had \"issues.\" She said that I\nought to sleep with a woman. Ultimately, she turned out to be right that the problem was\none of sexual identity, but she was wrong that I was a repressed bisexual. Her campaign\nto get me to sleep with her ended in a threesome with a guy I had a crush on. I liked bits\nof that evening, but most of it was boring -- if not distasteful. When I tried to talk to my\nfriend honestly about it later, she insisted that I loved the whole experience. She said that\nI was merely feeling morning-after guilt. \"You were totally into it,\" she informed me. She\nwas clearly smug with victory, but angry that I resisted her version of events. I felt\nresentful for years.\nI didn't even tell my partners about my orgasm difficulties until I'd known them for a\nwhile, because my secret felt like such Restricted Information: I couldn't give it to anyone\nI didn't trust. I couldn't abide the idea of \"everyone knowing\" how broken I felt. I couldn't\nstand the combination of pity and fascination that my problem evoked in the few who\nknew.\nWhen I did get around to telling my partners, that was most complicated of all. I was\nquite unpopular in high school, and so I was something of a late bloomer -- boyfriendfree\nuntil my late teens. It took years before I had any confidence in my boyfriend\ninteractions. And because I had no idea how to come and no idea where to start and little\nidea of how to communicate about sex, I could not give guidance about what I wanted.\nI also felt paranoid that lovers would resent me if they felt I was demanding something\ntoo \"difficult\" during the sexual \"exchange,\" so I downplayed my feelings. I told awful\nlies like \"it's not a big deal that I can't come\" -- lies that broke my heart as I spoke them,\nbut felt safer than the truth.\nI did manage to have one orgasm in my teens -- one. I'm still not sure how it happened. It\noccurred one evening when I was incredibly tired, but went out with friends to get a\nfudge brownie sundae anyway. When I got back, my boyfriend came over and wanted to\nhave sex, and I let it happen -- despite being tired and uninterested and full of sundae --\nbecause I had not yet internalized the notion that my boyfriends wouldn't hate me if I\ndenied them sex. I was barely present during the act, but I jolted into awareness when I\nrealized I was having an orgasm. Afterwards, exhaustion overwhelmed me and I fell\nstraight into sleep -- so deep that my boyfriend was unable to wake me.\nThis was puzzling and hard to analyze. What aspects of my singular orgasm should go\ninto my Unified Theory... and which aspects were irrelevant?\nThe chocolate? Well, chocolate is arguably a mild drug, and drugs help some people\ncome. Also, there were studies that found mild aphrodisiac qualities to chocolate. So\nmaybe.\nThe position? The position had felt really good but was somewhat awkward, and I felt\nweird asking my boyfriend to reproduce it, so I didn't let myself think about the position.\n(I'm much better at communicating with my partners now.)\nWhat about the exhaustion? It made sense that being very tired might help me \"let go.\"\nBut I hadn't been very turned on or enjoyed the rest of the encounter, mostly because I\nwas so exhausted; and I didn't want to deliberately force myself to have sex while tired.\nSo while the exhaustion might have been a factor, I filed it under \"less-than-useful\" as\nwell.\nI didn't worry about the problem too much for a while, because I figured that now that I'd\nhad one orgasm, surely it would become easy. I didn't tell my boyfriend it had happened,\neither, because I didn't know how to describe exactly how. I thought I'd figure it out as\nwe went along, and then I would tell him exactly what it took.\nUnfortunately, it wasn't that easy. Months and years passed without replicating the\nincident. Anxiety began seeping back. My Unified Orgasm Theory was not doing well.\nMy fear of being perceived as \"demanding\" during sex and relationships was at a\nridiculous extreme back then. For example, I'd heard over and over that boys don't like\ngirls who are \"high-maintenance,\" so I told my boyfriends that I never wanted them to\nbuy me flowers. I thought that men would feel relieved that they didn't \"have to cater to\nme,\" but they were just puzzled. (One responded by buying me fake flowers.)\nBecause of the awful shaming stereotypes around cunnilingus, I sometimes refused that\ntoo. I couldn't believe that the boyfriends who were willing to go down on me were\nactually enthusiastic about it, enjoying it -- and when my anxiety became too painful, I\ninevitably stopped them. I always stopped them long before I stopped enjoying the act,\nbecause I was so scared that they hated it, and hated me for wanting it. I was scared that\nthey resented me more and more, the longer they did it and I didn't come. My fear crept\nup my spine and twisted around my heart until I had to make them stop.\nSometimes I felt trapped between love and disgust, like with the boyfriend who\nconstantly complimented me on how great in bed I was, but who seemed unaware of how\nmuch I felt missing. The worst was when he went off on a rhapsodic list of my wonderful\nqualities ending with: \"... and I don't even have to worry about giving you an orgasm!\"\nHe didn't see the bind he was putting me in, the awful self-suppression and self-wounding\nthat he encouraged. He seemed unaware that I heard him telling me: \"You're great in bed\nbecause you are constantly disappearing your own needs, and never asking anything\ncomplicated of me!\"\nIn fairness, I wasn't giving him any guidance on how to do better with me. In fairness, I\nhad no idea what kind of guidance to give.\nThey had their own social programming, and I didn't communicate well. But sometimes I\nstill have trouble forgiving my early boyfriends.\n* * *\nIV. The Fight\nNot all my boyfriends were willing to do as little as going down on me. One, in\nparticular, resisted very strongly; never did it at all. This was an especial problem because\nhe was one of the men I've loved most in my life, and our relationship lasted for years. I\nthink well of him when I think of anything other than sex. But when I remember having\nsex with him, I feel echoes of sick panic and heartbreak.\nBy the end, every time I slept with him I felt nothing but disgust.\nHe seemed to prove all my fears: that the men in my life would loathe and resent me if I\ntried to discuss my confusion and desperation; that they would loathe and resent me if I\nasked for help with my sexual needs. Towards the beginning of our relationship, I tried\nasking him (very timidly) to go down on me, and he simply refused. In later\nconversations he insisted that cunnilingus was \"too degrading,\" an assertion he made with\na weird lack of irony, given that I was going down on him regularly.\nAs the years passed, my frustration deepened and I started thinking about experimenting\nmore sexually, but I was terrified of mentioning it. I didn't know what I wanted to\nexperiment with -- I really believed that I'd \"already tried\" BDSM, and that I didn't like it\n-- but his initial rejection of mere cunnilingus didn't make me feel confident.\nFinally, I got to the point of directly asking for sexual experimentation, and we had the\nworst fight ever.\nI recall that our relationship was somewhat rocky already. One of my journal entries from\nthat time contains the sentence, \"I can't seem to not make him angry when I'm trying to\ndiscuss our relationship.\" For this particular fight, we were sitting in his room reading\nwhen I scraped together my courage and asked for his help in figuring out my sexuality.\n\"Well, what do you want me to do?\" he demanded.\n\"I don't know,\" I said, \"but I think there must be some way to find out -- I don't know,\nthere have to be books?\"\n\"That's ridiculous,\" he snapped. \"I love you, but I'm not going to read books in order to\nfigure out how to have sex with you.\"\nIt got worse from there. I was crying within the first few sentences. At one point, he\noutright shouted at me \"I don't care about your satisfaction,\" at which point I said, \"You\ncan't mean that,\" and he repeated it. Eventually, I simply turned around and walked out of\nhis room. I had nowhere to go; it was a long train ride to visit him, and the trains had\nstopped running that day. It was mid-winter, and freezing cold. Crying, I put on my coat\nand shoes and exited the house, onto his suburban street.\nI walked completely at random. I was hardly able to see. Fortunately, because it was so\ncold, no one else was out and about. I muffled my sobs by bowing my head into my\ncollar. After fifteen minutes, I discovered my cell phone in my pocket and tried to call my\nbest friend, but she didn't answer. I was still walking around crying an hour later, when\nshe returned the call.\nShe calmed me down and got the story out of me. It was the first she'd heard about my\ninability to orgasm, and she didn't know how to advise me because she didn't have the\nsame problem. Also, it was obvious to both of us that trying to communicate with my\nboyfriend wasn't working. It was obvious that there might be no way to successfully\ncommunicate with him on this topic at all.\nEventually, after she'd managed to quiet me into a trembling jellylike mass, my friend\nsaid gently, \"Okay, hon, you need to hang up and go back inside.\" She was right. So I\ndid.\nWhen I stepped back into my boyfriend's room, he was still reading. I could sense from\nthe texture of our silence that he felt bad, though. I was exhausted, I felt like a stiff breeze\nwould blow me apart, but I told myself that I had to set a line. I was sure my voice would\nwaver as I made myself say: \"If you're going to tell me that you don't care about my\nsexual satisfaction, then I can't do this anymore....\"\n\"I never said that,\" he said softly.\nI closed my eyes. He would do this sometimes, insist that he hadn't said words I was sure\nI'd heard, and it always made me feel like I had gone insane. I knew he'd said it. I'd even\nresponded with, \"You can't mean that,\" and then he'd repeated it. But I felt so tired. It\nhad been hard enough to start the conversation. Hard enough to walk around the streets\ncrying for hours.\nMaybe I really did misunderstand him somehow; I've been over those moments in my\nhead a million times, and I don't know anymore. Maybe I misunderstood. Or maybe he\nwas falling into a classic pattern of emotional abusers. Maybe he insisted that I was\nhallucinating in order to confuse me out of protesting: abusers do these things because\nthey work.\nWhat I do know for sure is that when he halted the conversation with a flat denial, I\ncouldn't bring myself to even try to talk about it again. Couldn't bring myself to resume\nthe conversation. But I also couldn't bring myself to break up with someone I loved so\nmuch. We talked about other things instead.\nAnd, of course, nothing about our sex life changed at all.\nWhen my best friend called me the next day to check in, I said, \"Well, he says that he\ndidn't say what I thought he did.\"\nHer silence echoed with disbelief.\n\"Maybe I just... didn't understand what he actually meant,\" I said, but my words sounded\nweak even to my own ears.\n\"Maybe,\" she said doubtfully, but she didn't press the issue.\nEven after that fight, I continued dating that man for a long time. I look back now and I\ncan't imagine how I did it.\n* * *\nV. Men's Perspective\nThe gendered societal pressures that affect men are worth discussing, and worth\nanalyzing, and I often do just that. There is undeniable pressure on men to \"perform\"\nsexually, for example. I try to have sympathy for men who feel this pressure -- but it is\ndifficult sometimes, because its major effect on my life has been to silence me. To make\nme feel as though I couldn't ask for anything sexually. As though I couldn't express my\nneeds without hurting my boyfriend's feelings or making him angry.\nAnd even now, when I talk about this stuff, I am as vague as I possibly can be about the\nexact timeline. The last thing I want is for people who know me to read this and know\nexactly when I started having orgasms. I don't want anyone to know exactly which\npartners \"couldn't perform.\" Because I know those men might feel it as a social\npunishment, and as much as I hate the dynamics at work, I can't hate the men who were\npart of them. They had their own social anxieties and their own blind spots and if I didn't\nunderstand what was wrong, how could they?\nI recently had dinner with a former partner. At one point we found ourselves having a\nvery explicit conversation, and I mentioned that I've figured out how to come. He looked\nsad and apologized: \"I'm sorry I was never able to get you there.\" I had no idea what to\nsay.\n* * *\nVI. S&M, Redux\nI finally came into my BDSM identity around age 20. At first, when I was faced with the\nfact that I wanted to be hurt until I cried and begged for mercy, I freaked out. I had no\nidea what to do about BDSM, no idea how to feel about it. The only thing I knew for sure\nwas that I'd found something I really needed. But what did that mean for me, when I was\nalso trying hard to be an independent, rational feminist with self-esteem and integrity?\nIt took me years to parse out my thoughts on feminism and BDSM, to feel comfortable\nwith BDSM, and to talk openly and comfortably about it. During that process, I got better\nand better at finding partners who were interested in my sexual desires and willing to\nexperiment. I also got to the point of reading sexuality advice books on my own,\nincluding books specifically on BDSM. (For recommendations, please check the notes at\nthe beginning of this book.)\nAnd I gritted my teeth, forced down my anxiety, and looked into books about the female\norgasm.\nOne book that came highly recommended from Amazon.com was Lonnie Barbach's For\nYourself. By the time I was halfway through the first chapter, I was crying because what\nshe wrote felt so true. At the end of the first chapter, I put it down and was never able to\npick it up again. Barbach wrote compassionately about experiences very similar to mine\n-- for instance: [Are you afraid to talk to your partner about your problem] because\nyou're embarrassed to ask for what you want at a particular time; afraid your partner\nwill refuse, get angry, or feel emasculated?\nBut she also ended the first chapter this way: You have to assume responsibility and be\nsomewhat assertive. Our culture has taught us that a woman should depend on a man to\ntake care of her, which means she can blame him for any mistakes. It's nice to be driven\naround in a car, but it's also nice to be able to drive yourself so you can go where you\nwant to, when you want to. But to do that, you'd have to assume some responsibility.\nIt was the same \"let go\" and \"keep trying\" advice I'd been coming across for years, except\nthat now it was wrapped up in a nice package of assumptions about me: implications that\nI wasn't assuming responsibility or being assertive. I felt like she was telling me that I\nchose to depend on a man to take care of me.\nMaybe it would have been okay if the rest of the chapter hadn't been so miserably true,\nbut the combination of reading a bunch of truth about how I was feeling -- then being told\nthat I wasn't trying hard enough, that I was choosing to avoid responsibility.... It was\ntoxic.\nI also had the bright idea of asking my gynecologist. The doctor rolled her eyes as I\nspoke, then told me that the problem was obviously my partners. When I insisted that I\nneeded more guidance, she referred me to a center that gave orgasmic dysfunction\n\"evaluations\" at $1,500.00 a pop. I was earning $7.50 per hour at the time. I didn't go.\nI got up my nerve and talked to my mother, who had been extremely helpful and caring\nwhen I came out to her about BDSM. During the BDSM conversation, I'd been scared --\nthen I felt immense relief as Mom told me that there was nothing wrong with me, and\nreassured me that I wasn't \"giving up my liberation.\" When it came to orgasms, though,\nshe seemed unsure of what to say. She did at least tell me that she, too, couldn't come\neasily, which made me feel a little better.\nMost helpful was the therapist I found on the Kink Aware Professionals list -- an online\nlist of doctors, lawyers, and other professionals who believe they understand alternative\nsexualities such as BDSM. I tried one therapist who didn't seem to get it, but the second\ntherapist I saw was wonderful. He helped me through an enormous amount of my BDSM\nanxiety. The orgasm problem was thornier, but he didn't make any assumptions, and he\ndid listen carefully, which was more than most people did.\nMy therapist gently encouraged me to get a second opinion about my how my body\nworked, from a new gynecologist. Irrationally, I didn't. I suppose I still felt crushed by\nhow the first gynecologist had reacted. I also hoped I'd learn to come as I explored\nBDSM more -- which turned out to be true.\n* * *\nVII. Figuring It Out\nIn retrospect, I recognize that I went through a brief period where I had orgasms\nsometimes -- weak ones. But the orgasms were hard to hang on to because they happened\nduring sex with my boyfriend. This would be the same boyfriend I described at the\nbeginning of this piece, when I wrote: now I have the best boyfriend I've ever had. but\njust like every other one, he can't get me off. big dick? oral sex? tons of foreplay? kink?\nit's all there.\nNow I see, in retrospect, that not everything was there: neither of us had questioned our\nsexual assumptions, our societally-determined sexual scripts. And one of the biggest\nsexual scripts is that sex ends with the man's orgasm. That the man's orgasm is the goal.\nIt's very hard to think around these scripts. It's very hard to even be aware of them. So,\nsince my paramount goal during sex was obviously \"satisfying my man,\" I often pushed\nmy orgasm away due to my focus on him. I knew that if I came then I'd feel tired and less\ninterested in sex (at least for a while). And obviously, if he were to have his all-important\nmanly orgasm, I couldn't go falling asleep on him could I? I couldn't even pause to\nmentally process my sensations if he seemed to be enjoying himself, now could I? Plus,\nonce he'd come, I certainly couldn't expect him to stimulate me any more than he already\nhad, because he was tired; he'd just had an orgasm!\n(These days, one of my #1 judgments of whether a new partner could be good for me is\nthis: if I didn't come before he did, then does he take a moment post-orgasm to catch his\nbreath, and then turn to me and smile and offer to do what it takes?)\nIn the end, figuring it out was almost anticlimactic.\nI saw an online video from sex educator Betty Dodson called \"Did I Orgasm?\"... and I\nrealized that I'd been occasionally having weak orgasms already. I was also\nexperimenting more and more with BDSM; simultaneously, I put more and more power\ninto the hands of my fantasy men; and once I had compelling private fantasies to feed on,\nI couldn't help masturbating. Here was the key: initially, I'd felt that masturbating in itself\ninvolved having too much control over the situation. And that's not how my sexuality\nworked.\nOh yes, in practice I take responsibility for my pleasure; and now I'm pretty good at\nclearly discussing what kind of role my partners will take ahead of time, describing what\nthey'll do with me. These days, I sometimes take the dominant role, too. But even now,\nit's hard for me to come if I feel like I'm in control.\nOn some level, even if it's the most tissue-thin fantasy, I usually have to convince my\nemotional-sexual self that I'm not in charge. It helps if I have an emotional connection\nwith whoever I'm fantasizing about, too. If I don't have an emotionally involved romantic\npartner, I seem to automatically create BDSM-themed fantasy worlds with hilariously\nornate storylines. Years ago, it never occurred to me that I couldn't reach orgasm because\nmy internal characters weren't compelling or my plotlines weren't dramatic enough... but\nsometimes it's true!\nIn my case, I believe that BDSM is the key to my sexuality. It is as close to the core of\nmy sexual identity as I can get; close enough that, like some other BDSMers, I\noccasionally call it my \"orientation.\" But I don't think BDSM is like that for everyone,\nand I don't even think that's the whole story with me -- because during the whole time,\nthis self-discovery process, I was doing things like eating more regularly, keeping a\nhealthier diet, putting some weight on my previously stick-thin frame, and exercising\nmore. Health plays a big role in any kind of sex, and it's important to think about. Still,\neven now I can't come without some thread of dominance and submission, even if it's an\nentirely internal fantasy that I imprint on whatever is happening.\nWhen women ask me for advice on how to have orgasms, I feel helpless because there is\nno \"one true way.\" I don't want to fall back on the old \"let go\" and \"keep trying\" that I\nreceived -- it's decent advice, but it's so vague. Perhaps something more useful would be\nthis: first, it really helps to have an idea of what you want. I know this can be hard in a\nsociety that soaks us with sexual images designed for stereotypical men, rather than\nimages for women (and especially not for non-normative women like myself). And I feel\nso aware of how patronizing and useless the \"you aren't in touch with your sexuality,\nthat's why you can't come\" argument can be. Remember, I had that argument used against\nme by my lesbian friend. But it was, in fact, kinda true for me -- just in a different way: I\nneed BDSM.\nIf you're not sure what you want, don't panic. Just keep your eyes and ears open, and try\nto monitor your reactions. It may surprise you. If it does, don't worry -- just research it!\nNo matter how unusual your sexuality, there is probably information on the Internet\nabout it. (And even if your sexuality is unusual, odds are it's not nearly as unusual as you\nthink it is.)\nI often refer to my personal favorite sex education website in the entire world: it's\nScarleteen.com, a grassroots feminist effort with an amazingly comprehensive\nperspective. Scarleteen has an incredible impact on many, many lives. Sometimes I read\nit just for fun!\nSecondly: it may help not to prioritize orgasms. I am not saying orgasms aren't important;\nI just don't want the importance of orgasms to wound you, the way it wounded me. For\nme, it is helpful to imagine sex as a journey. For me, it helps to focus on having fun\nthroughout, instead of doing what it takes to reach the \"goal\" of orgasm. If you're not\ntaking pleasure in the journey -- or at least indulging some curiosity -- then why keep\ngoing? Why not stop and try something else?\nExperimenting sexually in an open-ended way has been, for me, the most productive\npossible attitude. And in fact, once I knew how to make myself come, I discovered that --\nthough it's helpful to be able to attain that release if I really want to -- orgasms aren't\nactually my favorite part of sex! There are lots of other things I like better.\nIt's also worth noting that our definitions of \"orgasm\" are fairly narrow. Some research\nindicates that there may be other ways to conceptualize orgasms than the stereotypical\ngenital-focused approach.\nThirdly, although it's possible for a person to explore sexuality on her own, relationships\ncan make or break the process. We all make some compromises for romance. But when\nwe compromise, we should know what we're compromising, and we should think about\nwhether the compromise is worth it.\nFor me, sexual exploration and satisfaction are incredibly important -- but it took ages to\ndevelop the courage to put my foot down about them. After my boyfriend shouted at me\nthat he didn't care about my sexual satisfaction, it took me an embarrassingly long time to\nend things with him; I really was in love, and we'd been together for years. But my\nsexuality wasn't even close to a priority for him, and breaking up with him was one of the\nbest decisions I ever made.\nAfter ending that relationship, I was able to build my self-confidence and self-esteem\nwith new boyfriends surprisingly fast -- and my boyfriends helped me more than they\nprobably know. I owe countless small debts to men who accepted my inability to orgasm,\ntook my anxieties about it into account, and sometimes gently pushed me to try new\nthings.\nOne particular guy comes to mind: I told him I couldn't come, but that I wanted to\nexperiment with S&M, so we arranged to buy rope and some painful equipment. During\nour conversation, he gently drew me out on my history, and then he said, \"You know\nwhat I think we need to go along with this rope? A vibrator.\"\nI blinked and said hesitantly, \"I don't know, I've never really liked vibrators.\" But I was\nwilling to try it again, and that's when I learned that vibrators are awesome. That's when I\nlearned that what I really need is to convince myself I'm not in charge -- that once the\ncorrect fantasy is in place, vibrators make everything easy.\nEven today, few things make me happier than a man who grasps the tension I still\nsometimes feel about \"being demanding\" or \"asking for too much.\" I communicate with\nstraightforwardness that amazes most partners, but it's crucial for them to understand that\nI still have hesitations. That even I, sometimes, need a moment to articulate what I want\n-- or need to be asked whether there's anything he can do.\nLastly, and most importantly: don't let go of your boundaries unless you're sure you're\nready. If you really don't want to do something, you don't have to make yourself do it.\nI'm writing this because when I was growing up, all the sex-positive work I read\nencouraged exploration at the cost of boundaries, and I think that's wrong. There were\ntimes when that attitude hurt me -- for example, I did things I didn't like because people\nclaimed I hadn't yet gotten over my sexual \"issues,\" like my lesbian friend in college.\nAnd I know that attitude has hurt other women, too.\nI don't like seeing sex-positive feminism equated with making oneself freely sexually\navailable. Exploring sexuality does not mean you have to ignore your warning bells.\nSexuality is so complicated. Sex cannot be reduced to bodies, or hormones, or\npsychological stereotypes. Sex cannot be reduced to certainties, to shoulds and\nshouldn'ts. If I could destroy every force in our lives that drives home ideas of sexual\n\"normality,\" I would. Which leads to my final piece of advice: don't let me tell you\nwhat to do. This is just my experience, just my ideas. As with everything, I want you to\ndo whatever feels right for you -- as long as it's among consenting adults.\n* * *\nVIII. Study Questions!\nHere are some things that might be interesting to reflect on:\n1) What questions do you have about your orgasm?\n1a) Where have you researched the answers to those questions?\n1b) Have you ever discussed those questions with your partners?\n2) What questions do you have about your partners' orgasms?\n2a) Have you ever asked your partners about their orgasms?\n3) What's one thing you wish you'd said in bed to a partner?\n3a) What would have made it easier to say it?\n4) What are your favorite sexual acts? Are there other ways you could perform them?\n5) What's the best sexual experience you remember? What made it great?\n6) What's the hottest thing you've seen or read? What made it great and are there ways\nyou could participate?\n7) Does anything from this article resonate with you? What?\n* * *\nHere is a tangential footnote on issues of manliness:\nWhen this article was first posted, a guy grabbed the first comment on the version that I\nposted to the feminist blog Feministe, protesting that I clearly don't get the men's side of\nthis equation. I don't usually get super angry about comments on the Internet, but in that\ncase I did, and I had to take a while to calm down.\nThere was a mild comment fracas. Eventually, in response to that guy, I wrote:\nI worked really hard on this article to try and note both:\nA) how men's perspective might make this difficult for them, but simultaneously\nB) why men's insecurities aren't actually an excuse for men to treat women badly.\nIn my experience women are actually extremely aware of men's insecurities. Women\nfrequently silence themselves and put up with a lot of crap because we are afraid of\n\"emasculating\" our man, as I specifically noted in the article.\nGiven that this was an article about:\n1) a woman's experience,\n2) and what it's like to be a woman,\n3) and why this issue is difficult to take on as a woman,\n4) and why women shouldn't allow men's insecurities to shut us up...\n... can you see why I would avoid putting a lot of text towards describing men's\ninsecurities in loving detail?\nNow. With that having been said....\nOne of the guys in the Clarisse Thorn Manliness Brain Trust (tm) emailed me with some\nthoughts in the wake of this article. Once again, I want to emphasize that I don't want\nanyone to feel that they \"ought to\" give a crappy partner \"another chance\" if that partner\nis treating them badly. I spent years giving a terrible boyfriend millions of second\nchances because I kept telling myself that he was just \"insecure.\" Walking away from\nthat oh-so-\"insecure\" man was one of the best choices I ever made. Nonetheless, I\nthink that the following comment from my Manliness Brain Trust (tm) friend might be\nuseful for some people:\nWhen I first saw this post, my first thought was that I have to pass it on to a couple of the\npeople I'm involved with, who have difficulty reaching orgasm because it's an awesome,\nawesome article. My second thought was that it seemed like Clarisse didn't really grok\nthe guy's side of this exchange.\nSomewhere among 5th, 7th and 9th thoughts, was the notion that I'd be a jerk to raise\nthat point in the comments. This article is a great reference for women working through\ndifficult climax issues and there's no need to drag the conversation off to the guy side of\nthe experience... So I sent Clarisse an email about it instead. Because the thing with\nUnification theories is that they're never all the way done. And things could have been so\nmuch easier for Clarisse if her boyfriends didn't suck. Maybe some insight into why they\nsucked would help with the ongoing development of the model, or at least provide some\neased management strategies.\nThe thing is, I don't feel attacked or diminished or anything else by this article. Despite\nthe fact that I'm a guy, I have insecurities and I can in some places see a stupid,\nobnoxious mirror of myself in Clarisse's dumb ex boyfriends -- that isn't at all why I\nthought I should talk about the topic more with the author. It just seemed to me like\nClarisse hadn't quite got her head around what the guys were going through with their\nside of this interaction. Where their insecurities came into play.\nIn my head, I see a young woman, working through her own issues with orgasms reading\nthis, and seeing her young boyfriend reflected in Clarisse's past relationships. And the\ntake away from Clarisse's experience at the moment seems to be that if your boyfriend is\ninsecure and stupid, maybe he's not the right person to work through this with you. And\nI'm not sure that's doing anyone any favors. I mean shit, maybe that is what you should\ntake away from reading this -- that the guy you're with isn't the right person for you right\nnow if you're struggling with difficulty achieving orgasm. But maybe there are other\nstories going on as well. Maybe he's insecure about his role and his failings (or his body\nor whatever) and maybe he could be the right guy to work through this with you, if you're\nthe right person to work through his insecurities with him?\nAnd please, please don't take that to mean let things slide because you don't want to\nemasculate him. I'm not for a moment advocating putting up with nonsense because he's\na guy with a precious male ego. But lots of guys, certainly including myself, have\npersonal insecurities, about masculinity and about sexuality, and attached to the\nperceptions of masculinity in sexual situations. As a guy, we're all taught that real men\ndon't give head -- or at least that it's a private thing that we don't admit too -- which is so\nfucking stupid, but is still really out there in heteronormative western male culture. We're\nall taught that getting a woman off is our job, and to be a good man, and a good lover,\nwe have to get our partner off before we get off. I don't know a single sexually active guy\nwho has never felt humiliated because he came too early, and too early is largely defined\nas before our partner gets off. And we're all taught that real men get their partners off\nwith nothing but the awesomeness of our cocks. Hand jobs/digital penetration are fine\nfor highschool or fore play -- but our image of a good man, and a desirable lover doesn't\nintegrate with those things. We're coached by pop culture and porn to believe that the\nguy every woman wants is the one who sticks his cock in and makes her explode with joy\nfrom the very first thrust. And any time that doesn't happen, the guy is at fault.\nAnd again, to stress my position here, I think all of those things are stupid, illogical\nnonsense. But those are the pressures that are on guys. And maybe, if the guy that you're\nwith is struggling to work through your orgasm issues, maybe it's because he's so far\nunder the weight of his own insecurities that he doesn't know how to cope with his own\nissues, and be a supportive partner to work through yours. But the thing about a good\nrelationship, is that together you're stronger than the sum of your individualities. Maybe\nas a couple, you can work through his insecurities and your orgasm difficulties at the\nsame time. Nobody's problems exist in a vacuum, and sometimes finding the support you\nneed is easier if you just fix the support you already have.\nI posted the comment in response to the other dude's Feministe comment, and there was\nsome discussion afterwards -- including some guys saying that they never got any memo\nabout cunnilingus being \"not manly.\"\nHere's my wrap-up: sympathy is good. Trying to build a better relationship is good. And\nI understand that some people may have serious, important reasons that they can't or don't\nwant to walk away from their romantic partner. (That's one of the things feminism has\nalways worked towards: giving people many sources of support and safety nets, so people\ncan leave abusive partners if necessary.) But. Seriously, if your partner sucks? Walking\naway is an option -- it's even an option, sometimes, when you think it's not an option. Just\nremember that.\n* * *\nThis post can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/10/31/a-unified-theory-of-orgasm/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nBOUNDARIES:\n[storytime] I'm Not Your Sex-Crazy Nympho Dreamgirl\nThis was originally published in 2011 on GoodMenProject.com, and it got a lot of\nattention. I think the feelings I outline in this piece are shared by a lot of people, and that\nthey're one of the reasons people often get angry about porn. But as I said in \"BDSM\nCan Be 'Love Sex' Too,\" I don't think restricting porn is the answer to these feelings. I\nthink the answer is encouraging people to be honest, yet respectful and flexible about\ntheir desires. For many people, mainstream porn seems to function as sex education --\nand that can be a real problem, because mainstream porn shows a very specific\nstereotype of sexuality. But if more people had better and more complete sex education,\nthen more people would recognize that mainstream porn is a very limited and particular\nproduct, and they'd also recognize that most people aren't interested in actually enacting\nthat style of sexuality. I also think porn probably receives an unfair portion of the blame\nin these debates. It's possible that the current ubiquity of porn is partly to blame for \"sexcrazy\nnympho dreamgirl\" anxieties, but there are plenty of other stereotype sources in\nour culture -- I wish that all the people who talk about banning porn would also talk\nabout banning romantic comedies!\n* * *\nI'm Not Your Sex-Crazy Nympho Dreamgirl\nThere's this cultural image of what it means to be female, and good in bed. The image\nincludes being young and thin and cisgendered of course, and that can be problematic.\nBut it also includes a lot of behavioral stuff: the way you squirm, the way you moan,\nbeing Super Excited about everything the guy wants to do, and Always Being Up for It --\nwhatever \"It\" is. When people think about \"good in bed,\" for a woman, that's often what\nthey think.\nHere's a short list of some things I think are totally awesome:\n+ Squirming and moaning during sex in a genuine way, out of genuine pleasure!\n+ Acting Super Excited when your partner wants to do something you're actually Super\nExcited about!\n+ Being up for sexual experimentation and trying new things, while keeping track of your\nboundaries and saying no (or calling your safeword) to sexual things you really don't\nlike!\nThose things are great. They're great when they happen in all kinds of sex, and I have no\nproblem with how people experience or deal with with those things -- whether people get\nthem from vanilla or S&M sex, or porn, or sex with multiple people, or queer sex, or\nwhatever. All consensual sex is fine with me. (In particular, in pieces like the one you're\nabout to read, I often have to make it really clear that I'm not anti-porn. OK? I'm not antiporn.\nGot that? Say it with me now: Clarisse Thorn is not anti-porn. Yay, it rhymes!)\nWhat scares me, however--what continuously gets my goat, what still occasionally makes\nme feel weird about sex -- is how easy it is to perform those three things I listed above.\nBecause I have always, since before I even started having sex, known exactly what I was\nsupposed to look like while I had sex. I don't even know how I internalized those\nimages: some of them through porn, I suppose, or art or erotica or what have you; some\nof them by reading sex tips on the Internet or hearing the ones whispered to me by\nfriends. But I can definitely assure you that before I had any actual sexual partners, I\nknew how to give a good blowjob. I also knew how to tilt my head back and moan, and I\nknew how to twist my body, and I knew what my reactions and expressions were\nsupposed to look and sound like -- I knew all those things much better than I knew what\nwould make me react.\nThere was a while there, where my sexuality was mostly performance: an image, an act, a\nshell that I created because I knew it was hot for my partners. I'm not saying I was\nperforming 100% of the time -- but certainly, when I was just starting to have sex, that's\nmostly what it was. And, scarily, I can put the shell back on at any time. Sometimes it's\nhard to resist, because I know men will reward me for it, emotionally, with affection and\npraise. It's much, much more difficult to get what I actually want out of a sexual\ninteraction than it is for me to create that sexy dreamgirl shell: hard for me to\ncommunicate my desires, hard for me to know what I'm thinking, hard for me to set\nboundaries.\nAnd hard to believe that a guy will like me as much, if I try to be honest about what I\nwant. Honesty means that sometimes I'm confused, and sometimes we have to Talk\nAbout It; honesty means that sometimes I say no, it means that sometimes I'm not Up For\nIt. Something in me is always asking: Surely he'd prefer the sexy, fake, plastic dreamgirl\nshell? It's not true, I know it's not true, I swear it's not true -- I don't have such a low\nopinion of men as that. I know this is just a stereotype, the idea that men are emotionally\nstunted horndogs with no interest in how their partners feel.\nSo sometimes, I have to fight myself not to perform. But it's worth it -- because the\nhardest thing of all is feeling locked into an inauthentic sexuality. I tell myself, I try to\nforce myself to believe it: even if a guy would like me more for faking and holding back\nand being so-called \"low-maintenance\" -- I tell myself it's a stereotype, but even if that\nstereotype is true of some men -- no man is worth doing that to myself. No man is\nworth that trapped, false, sick feeling.\n* * *\nBeing a sex and S&M writer sometimes increases my performance anxiety. Occasionally\nI'll meet guys who seem to think I am equipped to give any man the Night Of His Life --\nand that this is my goal at all times. Sometimes I feel like I should grab certain guys by\nthe shoulders and shake them and say, \"I am not your sex-crazy nympho dreamgirl!\nI'm a real person and I have real preferences, I do not exist just as your fantasy fodder!\"\nBut if I really like a guy and he's read some of my work, then I feel less irritation than\nconcern that I won't stack up. It increases the urge to go all Sexy Dreamgirl Shell, rather\nthan attempting to communicate.\nBeing a sex-positive feminist, I also sometimes worry that other women will read my\nwork and it will increase their performance anxiety. I worry that writing about some stuff\nI like will be misinterpreted -- that it will lead other women to feel like, gosh, is this\nsomething liberated sex-positive women do? Is this something I \"should\" be doing? With\nsome things I write, I get afraid that I've contributed to a nightmare world where women\nare \"liberated\" only in the sense that we can better perform for men.\nI once read a blog post by a radical feminist writer in which she claimed that women\nalways hate fellatio because it's always degrading and disgusting. She wrote something\nalong the lines of, \"I say this for the women and girls who believe that they have to do it.\"\nPart of me felt frustrated by the way she refused to acknowledge that some women really\ndo like performing fellatio (and many other women don't love it, but don't mind doing it\nas long as they have great sex otherwise). In some ways, it felt like that writer was\npolicing sexuality. But I empathized with her goal: She wanted women who don't like\nfellatio to relax; she wanted to help them recognize what they don't like. She wanted to\ndecrease their performance anxiety.\nI'd like to do the same thing, but I generally prefer to speak from personal experience\nrather than making claims about others' experience. Accordingly, I've often thought that it\nwould be great if more sex-positive feminists would make lists of Things We, Personally,\nDon't Like. It's not the easiest project to sell, because one of the big goals of being sexpositive\nis to destigmatize sexuality and decrease shame. But if we destigmatize sexuality\nwithout encouraging good boundaries, then we're not moving forward; we're just creating\nmore bad standards.\nSo hey, here's an example of a common sexual thing that I don't like: swallowing after\ngiving oral sex. I love fellatio most of the time, and I like it when partners come in my\nmouth, but I really hate swallowing. In the past I've found a variety of creative ways to\ndeal with this problem, some of which were hot (according to me, anyway) -- but usually\nI just spit it out in the closest sink. (The reason I don't like swallowing is that it makes me\nphysically ill. No, I am not interested in your armchair theories about why this happens;\nevidence so far implies a physical cause, not a psychological one.)\nA more complicated example would be facials. As a sex-crazy nympho dreamgirl, I am\nsupposed to love all facials all the time, to which I say: Bah. I'm occasionally into\ndegradation scenes, and facials feel really degrading to me, so there are circumstances in\nwhich a guy can come on my face and it'll be hot -- but those circumstances are rare. I've\ngot to really respect him and really trust him, and I've got to be really turned on and\nexcited about whatever scene we're playing out. And if a guy were to give me a facial\nwithout clearing it with me at some point ahead of time? Serious boundary violation. Not\ncool.\nHave I destroyed your image of me as your sex-crazy nympho dreamgirl? Good.\nI think that people of all genders receive a lot of unconscious training about how we can\ndamage ourselves in exchange for the attention of the opposite sex. By writing about my\nown experience, I don't mean to discount the experiences of others. I get that many guys\nfeel locked into acting confident and dominant, and that lots of guys hate that role as\nmuch as I hate my Sexy Dreamgirl Shell. I get that many women genuinely enjoy\nreclaiming the Sexy Dreamgirl image, and making it their own; hell, I do it myself\nsometimes. (Yes, I do it myself sometimes. Sex is complicated.)\nPeople of all genders have a hard time figuring out what turns them on. Authenticity is\nhard -- and sexual authenticity gets harder when you're feeling low, or you really like\nsomeone and really want that person to like you, or when you feel bombarded with\nmessages about how you've got to \"compete\" in a harsh sexual \"marketplace.\" I believe\nthat one of the best ways to authenticity is to seek understanding of the pressures on\neveryone, and to grasp that everyone's got their own nightmare of the Sexy Dreamgirl\nShell.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/05/27/im-not-your-sex-crazy-nympho-dreamgirl/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nBOUNDARIES:\n[storytime] Orgasms Aren't My Favorite Part Of Sex, and My Chastity\nUrge\nThese two articles were both written and published at OffOurChests.com after I\npublished \"A Unified Theory of Orgasm.\" The first was a followup to \"A Unified Theory\nof Orgasm,\" and the second wasn't, but when I reviewed the two articles later, I\nconcluded that they deal with fundamentally the same issues and belong together.\nInterestingly, when I posted this to my blog, most of the comments didn't come from\nwomen; they came from men who agreed that orgasms aren't their favorite part of sex,\neither.\n* * *\nOrgasms Aren't My Favorite Part Of Sex, and My Chastity Urge\nMy previous piece \"A Unified Theory of Orgasm\" was really well-received, and a lot of\npeople have thanked me for writing it. As always, though, there's some mixed feedback\ntoo. And I've been worried about one thing in particular: it seems like a lot of people\nmissed the part in my article where I said that, now that I've learned how to have\norgasms... orgasms aren't even my favorite part of sex. It's a long article, and I can see\nhow people would miss that, but I did say it and I think it's important.\nIt may be ironic that I spent so much time feeling terrible and broken and depressed\nbecause I couldn't figure out how to have orgasms... whereas now I prefer not to focus on\nthem. In fact, I estimate that most of my current sexual encounters don't include my\norgasm, and very few of my most pleasurable sexual encounters have included my\norgasm.\nI'm the first to admit that I don't know everything about sex, and there's a lot that I haven't\nexperienced. Anything might change. But seriously. The best sex I've had in my life has\nbeen connective and emotional and, for me personally, has frequently involved intense\nBDSM. My favorite sex so far? Has also mostly been orgasm-free.\nSome people in some sex-related communities have asserted that for maximum amorous\npower, it's actually best to limit one's orgasms, because then the contained sexual energy\nends up channeling into a deeper connection with one's partner. I can see that. For me,\nanother way of thinking about it is that I'm really into being teased -- and I'd rather\nexperience hours of being teased without an orgasm, than have a quick encounter that\nends in orgasm.\nAnd.... (Oh no, I can already tell this is going to get complicated... but hey, sex is\ncomplicated, so I'll give it a shot.).... Especially when I'm doing BDSM, it can actually be\nhot sometimes if I don't have an orgasm. For example: if I go to sleep so turned on that I\ncan't dream about anything but my partner, and then I wake up in a damp mess, and then\nmy partner makes my life difficult all morning, it's pretty awesome. (Although it's very\nnice that I know how to give myself orgasms now, because that means that if I'm really\nfeeling overwhelmed by my own sexual energy, I know how to give myself release if I\nhave to. You know, like... if I need to get some work done.)\nAaaaand... here's the most painful, ridiculous, circular irony of all. Ready? Here goes:\nnow that I'm capable of having orgasms, I've found myself occasionally having orgasms\nonly to satisfy my partner. How absurd is that? Plus, I know I'm not alone, because I've\ntalked to other women who do the same thing!\nI've written before that in the past I've felt trapped by fake plastic ideas of \"what hot girls\nlook like during sex\"; I've written about how the pressure to \"perform\" my sexuality can\nhurt. What has amazed me, as I've gotten older, is just how pervasive that pressure can\nfeel with some partners... and how little pressure there is with other partners. The\nquestion of how to create a low-pressure environment for sexuality to flourish is big and\ncomplicated, so let me just say here that although I'm all about people giving each other\norgasms... it's no good if my partner's desire to give me an orgasm turns into pressure for\nme to have an orgasm!\nScarleteen, my favorite sex education site, has a great article about \"squirting\" orgasms\nand how some women feel pressured to \"squirt\" for the sake of the sexual \"novelty.\" On a\nsimilar note, I'll close this post with an anecdote about a guy I dated a while back who\nwas very focused on giving me orgasms. To his credit, he figured out how to make me\ncome very quickly. But the problem was that -- I soon realized -- the biggest reason he\nwanted to make me come was because he wanted to feel like he could.\nFundamentally, it wasn't about my pleasure; it was about him feeling like \"the man.\"\nLet me be clear: he was a great guy, and I was into having sex with him. But it became\nvery obvious to me that if I didn't have an orgasm every time we had sex, then he would\nbe really bothered. So there were definitely a few encounters where, although I wasn't\nespecially interested in having an orgasm, I still closed my eyes and flicked through\nfantasies with a kind of panic... until I managed to kick-start my body into coming. Isn't\nthat messed up?\nOne thing I've learned, in years of writing about sex and gender, is that anything --\nanything at all -- can be a tool for limiting or stifling sexuality... just as much as it can be\na tool for releasing sexuality. Turns out, orgasms are no exception. Even orgasms can\nbecome a difficult duty. I'm so glad that I know how to have an orgasm now; for me,\nthat was an important step for my sexuality and my self-esteem. But now that I've\nlearned how to do that, I find myself questioning why it's such an important and\ndestructive issue in the first place!\nSex is a journey. There are so many directions, so many forks in the road, so many stops\nalong the way. There are so many speedbumps and roadblocks, uphills and downhills,\nfree and easy open stretches. Sometimes people stop to rest. Sometimes people double\nback. Everything is evolving. A lot of people find it most awesome to simply... enjoy the\nroad.\n* * *\nWhen I was in my late teens, I had a couple straight lady friends who did this thing where\nthey took a year of chastity... although they had already had a fair amount of sex. It\nwasn't that they thought sex was bad. It wasn't that they especially disliked sex. It wasn't\nthat they regretted choosing to have sex previously. But these women felt powerfully\ndrawn towards taking a year away from sex, a year where no sex happened in their lives...\nand I instinctively understood because I felt the same urge. In fact, I came up with the\nidea of deliberately taking a year of chastity on my own, before I heard that anyone else\nwas doing it.\nI'm not telling you this because I want to sound like one of the \"cool kids\"; I'm not trying\nto say anything like, \"I was into chastity when it was underground!\" As it happened, I\nnever actually went through with my chastity urge. But I thought about it a lot, and I\nthought about the fact that other girls I knew were doing it. We didn't have backgrounds\nthat one would normally consider anti-sex. We had liberal backgrounds, liberal parents,\nliberal educations. Why were we so attracted to the idea of taking a year without sex?\nI thought about it a lot, and I concluded this: We felt like we didn't own our sexuality.\nWe felt like our sexuality wasn't for us. Or at least, that's how I felt.\nEven though on the surface it looked like I was totally in charge of my sexual decisions,\nthere were social pressures and expectations that made me feel overwhelmed and\nconfused. Not always, and not all the time! But enough that there were plenty of times\nthat I just felt like all I wanted to do was stop and be done with it... \"take my body back\"\nfrom a world that seemed intent on constantly telling me how I must look, how I must\ndress, how I must have sex.\nI've written about how much easier it was for me to learn how I ought to look and\n\"perform\" while having sex, than it was for me to learn what I actually wanted from sex.\nThat, I think, is where the chastity urge came from for me. That, and the way I kept\nfinding myself making out with guys who I had zero interest in because it was \"too\nawkward to say no.\" Or the way I didn't feel like I could decide not to have sex with my\nboyfriends; not because I didn't think my boyfriend would listen if I said no, but because\nhis potentially hurt feelings seemed so much more important than my bodily preferences.\nSo many things about the way I was having sex seemed to have nothing to do with me.\nAnd if sex had nothing to do with me... then why was I doing it? I guess I wanted to\nreassure myself that I could take control of at least one thing: saying no.\nEventually, I got a better handle on my sexual preferences and began to learn how to talk\nabout them. It was a long process, and my sexual journey is far from over (yay!). There\nwere people who showed me what it meant to have a low-pressure sexual relationship;\nthere were people who made it easy for me to talk about sex; and there were other people\nwho made it easy for me to turn them down, sexually, which was just as important.\nBut one interesting thing during the beginning of my learning process... especially given\nthat I now really emphasize and encourage talking directly about sex... was that I felt like\na couple of my boyfriends really, really didn't want to talk about sex. And while\nsometimes this was clearly terrible and toxic, sometimes it felt good. It felt safe. I wanted\nto be sexual, but I also felt so much pressure to be sexual that it sometimes felt like a\nhuge relief to just... \"not worry about it.\"\nIn retrospect, though, I think that the \"safety\" I felt when I didn't talk about sex with\ncertain partners was a mirage. It was a false safety, sustained by a carefully crafted\nmutual fiction of the relationship. When we ended up talking about sex later, \"giving up\nthat safety\" just made the conversation unnecessarily scary and weird. And the\nindependent illusions we each had about our sexual relationship flourished and grew\nstrong within our silence. Those illusions were so much harder to release after months of\nself-reinforcement than they would have been if we'd dragged them into the light from\nthe beginning!\nOccasionally, I wonder how it would have felt if I'd taken that deliberate year of chastity.\nI wonder which of my early experiences would have changed; I wonder whether a year of\nchastity would have made me feel more comfortable with my sexuality sooner. I'm very\nhappy with how I feel sexually now. I sometimes feel confused or overwhelmed, but I\nthink I'm okay at handling that and even talking about it. Yet I do wonder how it would\nhave felt to draw such a strong boundary; to say such a strong \"No\" to the world and its\nmessed-up sexual expectations.\n* * *\nThis post can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/02/02/orgasms-arent-my-favorite-part-of-sex-and-mychastity-urge/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nBOUNDARIES:\n[theory] Anger, Fear and Pain\nI wrote this post in late 2010. The comments on the online version are especially good,\nwith a lot of people sharing their own experience of these emotions in S&M encounters.\nSo if you have an interest in the topic, this is a good post to review online.\n* * *\nAnger, Fear and Pain\nI like pain. I like submission. What do these things actually mean, though? I don't like it\nwhen I stub my toe, for example, and there are quite a lot of authoritarian situations I\ndon't like either. My emotional reactions, in particular, can get really complicated. So I\nneed more precise words than \"I like pain\" and \"I like submission.\"\nThis is not a new problem, and around the BDSM subculture there are more precise terms\nthat are frequently used. But when I was first exploring BDSM and didn't yet have access\nto the community, I started coming up with my own vocabulary for what I liked and what\nI didn't like. The primary words I came up with -- words that I still use a lot in my own\nhead, and that I sometimes try to explain to my partners -- were \"clean\" pain and \"dirty\"\npain.\nI think of some pain as \"clean\" because even if it's intense, I usually... like it. (For lack of\na better word.) This is the kind of pain I fantasize about when I'm really craving BDSM.\nThere are certain places on my body that take pain more cleanly -- my upper arms, most\nof my back, my thighs. There are certain types of pain that are inherently more clean --\nneedles come to mind. Wide, deep, blunt bites are good too. Heavy whips made of\nweighty materials, like suede. Pulling my hair right above the nape of my neck.\nOn the other hand, I think of some pain as \"dirty\" because it's... harder to take. I don't\nthink of it as dirty because I see it as scandalous or perverse -- rather, dirty pain is\ncomplex and hard to process. I never fantasize about it. Pain where my bones are close to\nthe surface of my skin, like my collarbone, is dirty. Pain on top of scars is dirty. Pinches\nand small, narrow bites are dirty. Pulling my hair anywhere besides the nape of my neck\nis dirty. Electric shocks are extremely dirty.\nBut this whole \"clean\" and \"dirty\" thing, it doesn't make any sense outside my own body,\nmy own head. It's hard to explain it. It helps that the BDSM community tends to frame\npain in terms of techniques and less-subjective adjectives, using words like \"sharp\" or\n\"sting\" or \"thud.\" (A lot of people think of \"sharp\" and \"sting\" as the same sensation. I\nusually separate them a bit more, but I'm not sure how many other people separate them.)\nThe BDSM and polyamory writer Franklin Veaux defines \"thud\" as \"sensation of heavy,\ndull impact\" and defines \"sting\" as \"sensation of quick, sharp pain.\" These words are\nmost often applied to floggers (implements for hitting people, e.g.: \"this is a thuddy\nflogger\"), but sometimes the words are used for other things too. I've found that I\ngenerally prefer thuddy-type pain, for example, but it took me a long time to figure that\nout, because there are so many specific sharp sensations that I love.\nOkay. Now for emotions. This is the really hard part.\nA while back I got an anonymous comment on my coming-out story that I absolutely\nlove. Here's a quotation from the comment:\nWhen it came to it, very little about the reality [of BDSM] matched my fantasies. Oh,\nsometimes what we did matched the way a real-life even can match a fantasy. There were\nmoments that were... Transcendental.\nBut there were many more moments that... were deeply, deeply conflicted. I NEVER\nexpected to feel that much... anger... toward someone dominating me and inflicting pain.\nI expected it to be a relief. I didn't expect to wrestle with hatred.\nHe liked to slap my face. Everytime he did it I would feel this burst of pure hatred. At one\npoint he asked if I liked it. I said, \"No. I hate it. But I don't want you to stop doing it.\"\nI can't remember right now if any other \"coming out\" story I've ever read included such a\nvisceral description of anger. Of course, I think the last time I read one I hadn't\nexperienced it myself. Maybe I never noticed it before, but noticed it this time because it\nresonated with me. But mostly I remember those stories mentioning fear, shame, worry,\nand embarrassment.\nThe events in my coming-out story took place years ago, and my feelings about BDSM\nare really different now. I remember that I was conflicted, furious, resentful. But at the\nsame time, I have often thought that much of my anger and resentment was due to the\nfact that Richard -- my first intense BDSM partner -- was not emotionally available. I\nneeded support that he didn't give me. (To some extent because neither he nor I\nrecognized how much support I needed.) And, of course, much of that anger was due to\nthe fact that I couldn't deal with BDSM. I was fighting back against my sexuality, and felt\nunable to take ownership of it.\nAs I settled my feelings and reconciled myself to my sexual identity, my emotional\nreactions became a whole different ball game. (It helped that I dated a string of men who\nwere more emotionally available and assisted me with emotional processing, too.) It\nturned out that the rage that I had suspected was inextricable from BDSM was, in fact,\nentirely possible to separate. I entered a stage where I learned how to avoid that anger. To\nwork around it. I learned to sink myself into fear and desperation, which I love, and\nwhich are easier to work with.\nI experimented with different types of submissive play. One thing I've learned is that it's\nalmost impossible for me to feel submissive unless someone hurts me. (There have been\nexceptions, but they were definitely exceptional.) The BDSM community has lots of\njargon for interpersonal emotional encounters, but those words usually describe actions or\nscenarios rather than feelings, like \"public humiliation\" or \"domestic servitude\" or\n\"sexual slavery.\" So I had to learn which emotions are associated with which actions, and\nthat's complicated too, though some things are just obvious. Some people really get off\non public humiliation, for example, but that's a strong and instinctive limit for me\nbecause it makes me extraordinarily angry. (There have been exceptions, but they were\ndefinitely exceptional.)\nI got better at calling out my safeword when I had to. Yes, I think it's hard to use a\nsafeword, especially when you're new... for all kinds of reasons: you don't want to\ndisappoint your partner, and sometimes it's hard to realize that you need to safeword,\nbecause it's very difficult to keep track of how you're feeling in the moment... but I also\nthink that calling a safeword when you need to stop is a skill that you can get better at,\nmuch like other kinds of boundary-setting. So I became fairly practiced at calling my\nsafeword when I needed to. If I started feeling very angry, I got good at halting the\nencounter, or shifting the emphasis to something else instead.\nAs I gained a more precise understanding of my physical reactions -- clean pain and dirty\npain -- I figured out that there are differences in emotional reactions, too. Loosely\nspeaking: clean pain makes me feel afraid and submissive, whereas dirty pain makes me\nmad. (Though this isn't always true. I hate spanking, for example; it irritates me; but it's\npretty clean pain. And it might be worth noting how much I hate tickling... but that\ndoesn't hurt.)\nIf the dirty pain is hard or unexpected enough, I can't seem to control lashing out. I fight\nback without even thinking about it (which often functions just fine as a way of\nrenegotiating the encounter, in itself, without safewording). If it's mild? I just get\nannoyed. But if it's intense... I don't just struggle, I attack. I leave marks on my partners.\nI learned to avoid dirty pain, usually. I learned to circumvent anger, usually. I had once\nseen anger, and dirty pain, as maybe being an unavoidable cost of BDSM. I once\nsuspected that I might never be able to have a BDSM relationship where I didn't feel\nanger, where I didn't feel pain that I didn't want. I was wrong. Those things aren't\nunavoidable costs. They can be worked around.\nBut now.... Yes, now! We've reached the part of the entry where Clarisse makes\nstatements about her current self and potential future actions that may or may not be true\nand should be treated with caution, because she is an evolving and complicated human...!\nNow that I've built up all these frameworks, I've had a few encounters lately where I\nfelt... a lot of anger. Sometimes connected to dirty pain; sometimes not. And I didn't stop.\nI watched how I was feeling and I dealt with it while it was happening, and it was... worth\nwatching. It was hard to take, oh, it was so hard to take. But it was also intense and\nfascinating.\nI've heard from a few other BDSM submissives that they like feeling anger during their\nencounters, that they need anger in order to get where they want to go.\nIf I follow the thread of anger, now....\nWhere will it take me?\n* * *\nThis post can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/12/26/anger-fear-and-pain/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nEVOLUTION:\n[theory] Sexual Openness: Two Ways To Encourage It\nThis was written in 2010, and it amazes me how I've changed since then.\nI don't like to talk about people being \"further along\" in their sexual experimentation\nthan others; people are simply in different places, based on their preferences and\nexperiences. I look at this piece now and I think that maybe it would be better-written if\nI'd tried to talk about sexual evolution in a more neutral way. However, it's undeniable\nthat when I was younger, I often felt like I was somehow \"held up\" or \"inhibited,\" and I\nno longer feel that way about sex. And I do think that in general, lots of people want to\nexplore but aren't sure how to overcome their own hesitance and psychological blocks.\nSome of them even write to me for advice, and I can only tell them what worked for me:\nthe approach I outlined in this post.\n* * *\nSexual Openness: Two Ways To Encourage It\nI've been thinking a lot lately about the factors that went into my sexual evolution. People\nhave always seen me as sexually open-minded, and I had an extraordinarily liberal\nupbringing... but at the same time, I think I spent a long time surprisingly buttoned-up.\nPart of it was the men I fell in love with, the partners I had. Monogamy felt right to me,\nand that effectively meant that once I was in a relationship, it was hard to explore\nsexuality beyond what my lovers were comfortable with. I've often looked back in\nfrustration at sexual shame and inhibitions that I feel were imposed on me by some past\npartners. But at the same time, there's no denying that -- even when my partners were\nrelatively inhibited -- I was with those men partly because I felt comfortable with\nthem. I recall conversations in which I felt frustrated at a lover's unwillingness to explore\nor discuss certain things... but I also recall times when I felt relieved that they were\nwilling to leave those things alone.\nHow did I evolve through that balance and come into the place where I am today, where\nmy sexual boundaries have shifted dramatically? I'm up for trying things just to see what\nthey're like; I routinely have fantasies that would have appalled me in my teens; and I\nroutinely have orgasms as well.... But why is it that, for example, I'm very interested in\nhaving multiple partners now, but wasn't at all interested a few years ago? Why did I\ninitially swear I'd never wear a collar, then end up associating collars with profound\nsexual love? How is it that I initially considered myself solely a submissive but later\ntransitioned into an enthusiastic switch (i.e., both a sub and a domme)?\nHere are the two factors that, I think, facilitate sexual evolution and openness:\n1) A pressure-free environment\nThis is key! A person can be pressured into sexual exploration, but in my experience it\nwon't \"take.\" Many people (though not all) who feel pressure react by becoming\ndefensive and unwilling to change; even if they do try the experiment, they're less likely\nto enjoy it. And someone who has a bad sexual experience will often have trouble\nenjoying that kind of sex in the future.\nTake me, for example -- there were a lot of reasons why I felt less willing to experiment\nwith polyamory (multiple relationships) when I was 20, but one of the big ones is that I\nfelt lots of pressure to be poly. Because I ran in highly \"alternative\" social circles, I was\nmeeting \"polyvangelists\" who argued that polyamory is the \"best\" kind of relationship\nand that anyone who doesn't want to try poly is just being selfish or close-minded.\nGeneral social pressure exerts an influence, so it helps to have open-minded friends\nwho accept different forms of consensual sexuality -- which doesn't just mean that\n\"vanilla\" people would do well to accept those of us who are \"non-standard,\" but also\nmeans that even people in \"alternative\" circles have to accept \"mainstream\" sexuality.\nBut in my experience, the actual sexual relationships are the most relevant aspect of\nlife that must be sexually pressure-free. They're also one of the most difficult,\nespecially when the stakes are high: if one or both parties are helplessly in love, if they\nare married, if they have children, if they live together... then it becomes very hard to\nmake the relationship pressure-free. A husband who is afraid that his wife might leave\nhim is more likely to do sexual things for her that make him uncomfortable because he\nwants her to stay, for example -- even if she doesn't ask him to. A girl who is totally in\nlove with her boyfriend is more likely to acquiesce to sex that she's not really into,\nbecause of course she wants to please him -- but she is simultaneously unlikely to tell him\noutright that she's not into it.\nAnd then there's the fact that what feels like \"pressure\" for each person will be different\ndepending on that person's triggers, the relationship, and the time in their life. Today, I\nfeel totally comfortable setting limits and clearly telling my partner \"no\" if he asks me to\ndo something I don't want to do... but it wasn't so long ago that I'd feel anxiety-inducing\npressure to do something if my boyfriend merely mentioned that he liked it. Which brings\nme to my next point: there's a fine line between sharing and pressure. One must be\ncareful when bringing up one's own preferences and desires -- which isn't to say one\nshouldn't bring them up! Merely that it's important to recognize that these are difficult\ntopics, and when we discuss them with people we love or admire, there's lots of potential\nfor accidental anxious pressure.\nOkay, I'm talking pretty theoretically, right? So here's some actual concrete advice on\nhow to avoid imposing sexual pressure:\n* Don't demand that people explain their preferences. A person doesn't have to\nexplain, examine, or \"figure out\" why they're gay, straight, kinky, polyamorous, or\nwhatever if they don't want to. Even your sexual partner doesn't have to explain why they\ndon't want to do something if they don't want to.\nIn fact, it may be very helpful if you merely make it clear that your partner doesn't have\nto explain from the beginning -- because they may feel as if they ought to, even if you\ndon't ask. I so clearly remember an encounter I had a few years ago in which my partner\nasked what I was up for and I said, hesitantly, \"Well, I'm not really up for sex tonight... I\ncan't really explain it, I --\" and he held up his hand. \"You don't have to explain it,\" he said\n-- and I was totally shocked at the gratitude, relief and comfort that poured through me.\nI later felt proud and thrilled to \"pay it forward\" when I had my first serious encounter as\na dominant. Towards the end of the encounter, I asked, \"Do you want me?\" and my\nsubmissive stiffened, saying awkwardly, \"Yes, I do, but... I don't want to have sex so\nsoon, it's just one of my own boundaries, I --\" and I saw how much the words were\ncosting him. Saw the same anxiety I'd felt once. And immediately I covered his mouth\nand said, \"Shh, it's fine, you don't have to explain it,\" and I saw him relax with the same\nterrible relief I'd once felt. And then we made out for many hours and it was unbelievably\nawesome.\n... Of course, sometimes people will want to examine their own preferences, which is\nobviously fine! But if your partner or friend is examining for their own mental wellbeing,\nthat's very different from demanding that they examine to satisfy you. Bottom line:\nthey don't owe you an explanation, and asking for one may just make them tense up and\nfeel totally unsexy in all ways.\n* Express preferences gently. I once attended an incredible BDSM workshop by the\nauthor Laura Antoniou in which she offered an outline for bringing up your filthiest,\nscariest fantasy with your partner: \"Buy ice cream. Sit down at the kitchen table and\ndescribe your fantasy. Then say, 'Don't say anything now. I'll give you some time to think\nabout it -- now let's eat this ice cream and maybe go out for a movie.'\" I love this advice\nbecause (a) everyone gets ice cream and (b) it's so perfect for lowering tension. And as\nLaura said, \"The worst thing that can happen is that they're not into it.\"\n[Editor's Note: since writing this post, Clarisse went vegan, and she recommends eating\nthat frozen Coconut Bliss stuff instead of ice cream. The chocolate flavor is absurdly\ndelicious.]\nIt's important to emphasize from the start: \"This is something I'm interested it, but it's not\na requirement and I don't want you to do it if you're not into it.\" In fact, it might help to\nbegin by saying those exact words.\nAnd if your partner doesn't want to do something now, it's often worth giving time for\nthem to grow into the idea. Perhaps by exploring other sexual angles, they'll come around\nto yours. I remember that when I was in my late teens, one boyfriend asked me if I'd be\nup for a certain kind of sex, and I refused. (He asked very gently, and didn't pressure me\nwhen I said no, which made me feel much safer and happier with him!) At the time I\ncouldn't imagine ever wanting to do it. Then a few years later -- after I'd gained a lot\nmore sexual experience -- I ended up asking my boyfriend to try it! I'm convinced that if\nmy previous partner had pressured me, I wouldn't have come around to it so easily years\nlater -- and if he and I had still been together, then maybe we would have even done it\ntogether.\n... But of course, the difficult part here is that sexual needs are important, and can't be put\non the back burner indefinitely. If you have sexual needs that are being routinely ignored\n-- or can't be fulfilled -- by your partner, then it's obviously not desirable to keep gently\nsaying, \"Don't worry, I can do without this.\" Still, I think that if you're approaching\nultimatum territory -- for example, if you are tempted to say that \"If you can't satisfy this\nneed, then I need an open relationship so I can find someone who can, or else we have to\nbreak up\" -- then it's best to at least state the ultimatum gently, emphasize that you care\nabout your partner and this is difficult, and steel yourself to act quickly in case you have\nto go through with your ultimatum. And, of course, to understand that this could make\nsexuality with your partner more difficult if you keep trying to date through ultimatum\nterritory.\nSadly, sexual pressure can sometimes be simply unavoidable. Sometimes the best we\ncan do is be gentle, understanding, and prepared to face the consequences.\n2) Exposure to new conceptions of sexuality, sexual mentors, and sex education\nMany gay people say they're \"wired\" for a certain approach to sexuality, but there's also\nothers, such as some BDSMers, who consider ourselves to be innately kinky. And we\noften say that we would have come to those sexual conclusions and practices whether we\nhad examples before us, or not. (Even so, it's really helpful to have a community sharing\ntips and emotional support, especially when it comes to alternative sexuality. It might\nseem like sex will come naturally and obviously, but sometimes non-obvious things can\nreally trip you up!)\nStill, there are lots of sexual ideas are worth exploring and wouldn't necessarily occur to\nus if we didn't have examples before us: erotica, pornography, friends and mentors,\nworkshops and educational materials. Here's some concrete advice on how best to\nemotionally access those:\n* Find a good mentor, or at least a friend or social group, to talk about sex with --\nwho you don't want to have sex with. Being able to honestly discuss turn-ons in a\nneutral environment is invaluable, as is someone who can guide and advise without\ninserting their preferences and desires into the conversation. Naturally, it's entirely\npossible to have a good sexual relationship with a sexual mentor -- and sometimes,\nmentor (or friend) relationships evolve in unexpectedly sexual ways. But it can be very\nuseful to take that element out of at least some relationships.\nOne piece of advice that I love is for mentors to be the same \"type.\" That is, for example,\nif you're a heterosexual female submissive, it's awesome to have an experienced\nheterosexual female submissive mentor if possible.\nThis post was edited to add the next paragraph: In the comments, Ranai pointed out that\nit's not always a great idea to have just one mentor -- and I agree with her. I think it's\nhelpful to have a range of voices who can give advice, if possible. There's nothing wrong\nwith trusting one person above others, but all humans have their blind spots, and mentors\nare human too. This is one thing I love about the BDSM community, by the way (or at\nleast, my experience with the BDSM communities I have been part of -- not all BDSM\ncommunities are the same...). In many BDSM communities, there are many cafe meetups\nand other low-pressure gatherings that make perfect environments for getting this kind of\nadvice!\n* Not all BDSM -- or porn -- or whatever! -- is the same. If you don't like (or are even\nrevolted by) something you see, then you can try watching (or reading, or talking about)\nsomething else. Me, I got really excited when I first learned about Comstock Films: Tony\nComstock makes documentaries that show real couples having real sex, and his\ndocumentaries are much more realistic and comfortably sexual than mainstream porn.\nAnd I really didn't like mainstream porn. But then I found that I wasn't that into\nComstock Films themselves, even though I love the idea so much that I screened one of\nthe movies at my sex-positive film series. So I concluded that I'm just not into porn at all,\nand that I'd be better off to focus on written erotica.\nBut then I finally saw some porn that turned me on at CineKink, \"the really alternative\nfilm festival\" -- and I hadn't even expected it to turn me on! I'd just been watching out of\nacademic interest! And these days, I find that I'm sometimes turned on by watching the\nmainstream porn I tried so hard to avoid in the first place. The moral of the story is\nobvious.\nThe bottom line is that mere exposure to new ideas about sexuality can bring personal\nsexual evolution -- and that's awesome. So if you're interested in facilitating your own\nsexual evolution, the first thing to do is learn about sexuality by whatever means possible.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/05/28/sexual-openness-2-ways-to-encourage-it/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nRELATIONSHIPS:\n[storytime] Fear, Loathing, and S&M Sluthood in San Francisco\nI originally wrote this and published it at OffOurChests.com in late 2010. If you've read\nConfessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser, or any of my posts that refer to \"Adam,\" then I\nprobably don't have to tell you which of these men later turned into Adam. But I'll spoil\nthe mystery for you, and tell you outright that Mr. ThereItIs is Adam. (In this entry, I\nnamed him after the post I wrote when I met him: \"There It Is.\")\n* * *\nFear, Loathing, and S&M Sluthood in San Francisco\nSince I was small, I've loved the Van Gogh painting \"Starry Night.\" I loved the cypresses\nin particular: winding spiral trees, hallucination trees. They were so unlike other trees I'd\nseen that I thought Van Gogh made them up, and so when I first saw cypresses years\nlater, I was stunned: the hallucination trees had been imported into my world. I'd like to\nthink that my world turned a little bit sideways forever, when I first saw cypresses, but\nI'm probably being melodramatic. (I'm good at that.)\nSan Francisco has cypresses, and a lot of other hallucinations, too. The city is full of\nangles, vantages, transitions, unceasing changing views: it feels, at times, like an\nunsolvable puzzle. A forested path leads darkly under a bridge, suddenly opens upon a\nmanicured lawn with a white lace conservatory. A cement staircase rises through a\nnarrow outlet, resolving itself step by step into a slice of brightly painted Victorian\nfacade. I walked once with a friend alongside an ocean road, pacing through thick fog,\nand arrived at a dirt path that I insisted on following; thirty seconds later we stumbled\nupon extraordinary ruins.\nSan Francisco. Halcyon city, heartbreak city. Cypress city. The place I come to recover\nfrom being torn apart and, it seems, sometimes the place where I get torn apart again.\nThis is okay with me, because nothing is more fun than overanalyzing strong emotions. I\nam not even kidding.\n* * *\nI returned from Africa recently; paused briefly in my adopted city of Chicago to collect\nmy thoughts; and then went to the Burning Man Arts Festival, thence to San Francisco.\nThis is my version of emotional decompression, and it worked! I feel much more\ncentered now. But part of decompressing, for me, was specifically going out to a lot of\ndates and BDSM parties and pushing my own boundaries, which carries its own potential\ndecompressable risks.\nAt the time of this story, it had been a couple of months in San Francisco, and I was\nleaving soon. I'd had an assortment of adventures, but there were two guys in particular\nwho I was excited about. Not necessarily in a long-term way -- I'm not in this for the\nwhite picket fence and the 2.5 kids (or at least, not yet) -- but definitely in a wow-I-haveto-control-myself-or-I'll-come-off-as-kind-of-puppyish\nway. New Relationship Energy: it\nis such a mind trick, such a delicious head-trip. You are the perfect drug.\nI had to control myself less when I first hooked up with The Artist: possibly the most\npostmodern individual I've ever met, possibly the most creative, who I've loosely been\nfriends with for six whole years, and who has never ceased to fascinate me. It is hard for\nme to meet people who keep me thinking, but The Artist never disappoints. If anything,\nour problem was shifting a cerebral connection into a sexual one: the first time we made\nout, I absolutely had to interrupt the proceedings because I'd forgotten to tell him about\nthis great sociology paper. It was okay to show how much I liked him because we'd\nknown each other for so long, it was easier to read the situation, easier to allow\ninvestment. Much harder with Mr. ThereItIs, who came out of nowhere, who I barely\nknew but had awesome chemistry with. In the beginning steps of this game, you can\nnever let them smell your fear.\nSaturday morning. I'd spent the night with The Artist, was checking my email while he\nmade breakfast. (He actually likes cooking, which I have trouble comprehending.) I\nwanted to plan my week, and texted Mr. ThereItIs to ask when we'd see each other. My\nbreath hitched as he texted back: he didn't think it'd be a good idea to spend the night\ntogether again, but he wanted to have drinks and catch up. I closed my eyes, made myself\nbreathe. Remembered how many times he'd pulled back, how much anxiety he'd\nexpressed about the BDSM we engaged in. I'd tried to make it clear that he was doing\nawesomely, but dollars to donuts he was still freaking out about it. I was his first-time\nheavy BDSM partner. Why do I keep doing this to myself? Haven't I learned my lesson\nabout vanilla-but-questioning guys yet?\nAfter giving myself a moment to calm down, I texted back that I was open to getting\ndrinks, but wanted to understand his motives better before doing so. \"Feel free to email or\ntext,\" I wrote, \"I can't talk right now,\" then put down my phone and walked into an\nintense conversation in the kitchen. There'd been some uncertainty over my last month or\nso with The Artist, due to surprisingly divergent relationship priorities. We're decently\nmatched in terms of being BDSM-identified, and we have so much else in common, but\nthere were some things I wanted to do that particularly freaked him out, plus he wasn't\nfeeling 100% comfortable with polyamory. Most of all, I've been surprised by his\nemphasis on settling down.\nThat Saturday, it ended with him deciding it wouldn't work. \"You and I are in such\ndifferent places right now,\" he said gently. \"You're still focused on having an interesting\nlife. I'm not prioritizing that anymore. I would have been a much better match for you\nfive years ago.\"\nYou're one of the most interesting people I've ever met, I wanted to say, how can you\ndecide this? The night before, we'd had a conversation in which he'd described how\nincredibly stable he wants his life to be. Well-designed apartment, respected job, kids, the\nlot. How much he wants to get away from past days, when he thrived among bizarre\nsubcultures, prioritized art above everything. He doesn't even want to travel! I listened,\nheart sinking. Trying to understand. \"Isn't there anything you can't walk away from?\" I\nasked.\n\"S&M,\" he said promptly. \"But that bothers me, because I don't know how I can make it\nfit.\"\nStability; making things fit. Saturday at breakfast, The Artist mentioned that a friend had\ncompared him to Alex, the main character in A Clockwork Orange: in the famous \"lost\"\n21st chapter, Alex decides that it's time to abandon ultraviolence and settle down.\nObviously, The Artist was never even close to being the psychopath that Alex is, but it's\nstill an instructive parallel. And I, with all my desire to push and stretch myself, with all\nthe boundaries I'm still seeking to subvert and hack and destroy -- I don't work with the\ndesire to settle down. I may never work with that desire.\nI understood. Of course I understood. I knew intellectually that it wasn't about me, I knew\nit was just about the situations at hand, but of course it hurt anyway. Two awesome men,\ngiving me the same message at once: This is too much, you're too extreme. A matter of\ntheir boundaries. Not about me. Of course it hurt anyway.\n\"Is there anything else you want to add while we're having this conversation?\" I asked\nThe Artist finally, as we wound things up.\nHe thought for a minute, took my hand. \"Well, you're wonderful and beautiful, but you\nknow that.\"\n\"Do I?\" I asked, and made myself laugh to take the sting from my words.\nAn aside:\n* * *\nOccasionally, my mother has tried to convince me that I am at emotional risk in part\nbecause of the fact that I am forward about my sexuality. Because -- I think this is how\nthe story goes, though she's never explicitly articulated it -- because it means that men\nwill see me as a disposable toy; the hot edgy girl he likes but would never settle down\nwith; the whore but not the Madonna. Cute enough to catch his attention and passionate\nenough that he'll call her back but ultimately, not \"the keeper\", not the girl he'd have any\nloyalty to in the end. I think my mom is afraid that I'll stumble out the other end of this\nbrilliant razor-edged fluorescent beautiful funhouse that is my \"young and attractive\"\nyears, that I'll come down like a girl falling through a distorted mirrored sheet of glass.\nThat shards will burst everywhere and I'll collapse, covered in metaphorical blood, and\nturn my eyes up to the harsh white stars and wonder how I let men use me and why.\nThis is the stereotype that I think she's afraid of, on my behalf, the one that comes up on\noccasion when she comforts me through heartbreak. My mother is hardly a conservative\nslut-shamer, but she loves me and she wants to protect me, so she tells me this. And I'll\nadmit it -- I fear it too, I feel those anxieties whispering behind me, thrumming through\nmy veins during times like these. What did I mean to him? Did I matter, did I make an\nimpression, does he give a damn? Would he be willing to Make A Commitment? He\ndoesn't care, God, I don't matter, and I was just stupid because God forbid I allow myself\nto like or trust a man that I fuck, when everyone knows that men don't ever have feelings\nfor the women they fuck --\nBut actually those fears don't make sense, do they -- they don't make any sense at all if I\nassume that men are complex humans who want to have relationships but aren't always\nsure about it (much like myself), rather than sex-seeking-stereotype-activated-robots. The\nfears don't make sense in the context of my own experience, which is full of friends and\nrelatives and lovers who have been caring, self-aware, honest men. The fears don't make\nsense given the fact that very often, I'm the one who prefers not to have a serious\nrelationship right now, or who can only compromise up to a point.\nAnd the fears especially don't make any damn sense if we assume that I want to pursue\nmy own goals, my own dreams, my own pleasures, my own sexuality on my own terms.\nIf we assume that I have no intention of playing by the rules in a world that tells me\nwomen never have our own damn sexual needs; that it's wrong or wicked or dirty for\nwomen to negotiate any sexual exchange for pleasure; that women are meant to trade sex\nfor \"commitment\" or \"support\" (though, bizarrely, never outright for money). If we\nassume that I can get something great from sexual relationships without Being On The\nPath To Marriage. That I understand and honor my sexual desires, that those desires are\nworth fulfilling in themselves. And if we assume that men have something wonderful\nthey could bring to the sexual exchange; that they aren't always \"using\" or \"exploiting\" or\n\"winning\" some kind of sick war-of-the-sexes, every single time they fuck.\nBut even if the fears don't make sense, sometimes they still come out and whisper at the\nback of my neck... I'm selling myself short. As if I should have bargained better, should\nhave traded my sexuality for far more than \"mere\" pleasure with someone I \"merely\"\nliked, was \"merely\" attracted to, who \"merely\" respected my boundaries and \"merely\"\nwas fun to hang out with. Would some people see it as ironic that I prefer relationships\nwith real emotional heft, even when short-term or casual? Even with that said, though,\nthere is no description of how reasonable, safe, or awesome my relationships are that will\nmatter to our slut-shaming society -- or to the fears it's hammered into me. Society,\nwhose judgment of whether a girl is a \"slut\" can be sudden and devastating, stupid and\nstereotypical; a lightning strike that lands based on absurd factors like how nonnormative\nor straightforward or aware of her sexuality she is. And once I'm a \"slut\" -- if I\ndare dance over that ever-shifting line -- then I'm beyond the pale. The world always\nseems to be outdoing itself in finding new ways to tell me that once I'm a slut, no man\nwill ever respect me again.\n* * *\nI went home. It was raining, all across my cypress city; raining so hard, I had to take the\nbus instead of walking. The rain struck me as an insultingly obvious metaphor, as did the\nfact that I was scheduled to attend a wedding that afternoon. It seemed strange that\nhallucinatory San Francisco would throw such tired tropes at me. (I should have trusted\nthe city more. It was with me, still.)\nI was sad. Not devastated. Just sad, and a little bit scared. I'm such a screwed-up\nperverted slut, no man will ever care about me. However, I'm an adult, so I tried to\nrecognize my emotional baggage, give myself some time to process, then eat a proper\nlunch and get some work done.\nI took a very dear, very blunt friend out to dinner recently. (Yes, I paid, and yes, he felt\nobjectified.) Over Indian curries, I tried to explain my fears that All Men (who are of\ncourse a monolith) will pigeonhole me as \"too much\", \"too extreme.\" A \"slut.\" Whatever.\nMy friend listened, savoring his delicious lassi as he thought about what I was trying to\nsay. Then he said, \"Look, you shouldn't worry about it. You're extreme. You're also tall.\nYou couldn't be un-tall for a man, and you can't be un-extreme. There are men who will\nlike you just fine for it, so just keep an eye out for those men.\" I could detect the edge\nunder his words: Come on, Clarisse, you're the one who always says that People Are\nDifferent, why do I even have to tell you this? A fair point, but I can't help it -- stories like\nthis still shake me.\nAs it happens, though, this story has a happy ending.\nI was about to head out to the wedding when I received an email from Mr. ThereItIs:\nSo my txt was not really well-considered. I was delaying writing you because I've got\nmixed and confusing inclinations about all this and was hoping I could figure them out\nbefore writing. So I spent last night drinking too much and ranting with friends about\nunrelated topics, which surprise turned out to not have helped me figure my shit out at\nall.\nI'm just feeling intimidated and uncertain about our kinkiness. On one hand I've been\nfeeling \"aaa this is weird, run away\". But I'm also feeling like this is fun and new and hot\nand fascinating, and I should get over my bs and try it again. So if you can forgive my\nimpulsive txt and my erratic emotions.... I'm free on your free nights this week.\nAnd if I've spooked you or your schedule has filled up, then I would be disappointed... but\nI'd understand. Sorry about the drama. I'm usually drama-free, I swear.\nIt was amazing how much further my internal anxieties resolved themselves upon receipt\nof this email: it was not only concrete evidence that men are human beings who are\nfrequently just as confused as I am; not only concrete evidence that men are different\nfrom each other, and assumptions should not be made about how they're feeling; but\nalso, it was concrete evidence that a man (a vanilla-but-questioning man, no less!) might\nnot inevitably fall into the stereotypes that feed my fears.\nI was still a little bit spooked, of course, but I did indeed see Mr. ThereItIs later that\nweek, and it turned out great. And as I was pulling myself together to leave his\napartment, I raised my eyebrows at him. \"I don't know if I'll ever see you again,\" I said,\nfishing. I didn't have any nights open before I was due to catch my plane out of the city,\nbut maybe some other time....\n\"You'll see me again,\" he obliged.\nI zipped up my backpack. \"I wonder why we have so much chemistry.\"\n\"I don't know,\" he said, \"but I'll read about it on your blog when you figure it out,\" and he\nlaughed and caught my wrists when I pretended to punch him. It was such a stupidly\nadorable moment that I am almost ashamed to write it down, but it was also such a\ncypress moment, I've got to mention it.\nAs for The Artist, we went to a charming museum a few days before I left, and had a fine\nold time. There was almost no tension at all. Right before we parted, we inevitably ended\nup discussing our brief romance, and the conversation was gloriously friendly. \"No hard\nfeelings,\" I said as I walked him to the bus, and meant it.\nI then tried to walk away from the bus, but it turned at the same corner I did and chased\nme down the street. Ack, I couldn't help thinking, so much for a nice clean exit. I was\nsuddenly possessed by ridiculous performance anxiety, knowing he could see me, so I\npaused and took a drag of a passing gentleman's cigarette, and then deliberately\nzigzagged away from the bus again.\nThe Artist texted me fifteen seconds later: \"That puff of a cigarette looked mighty tasty.\"\n\"I needed it to relieve my feelings of being watched from the bus,\" I texted back, then\nadded impulsively, \"Take care, handsome, and have lots of wonderful children.\"\n\"You too,\" he replied. \"We'll see if I become okay with poly first, or you gain these 'adult'\npreferences....\"\nI shook my head and laughed over my phone, walked home with a spring in my step.\nSan Francisco had done what I needed it to do.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/04/03/storytime-fear-loathing-and-sm-sluthood-insan-francisco/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nS&M:\n[theory] BDSM As A Sexual Orientation, and Complications of the\nOrientation Model\nThe first version of this post was written in 2009. I updated it slightly and reposted it in\n2012. The online version includes an evolving set of relevant links at the end.\n* * *\nBDSM As A Sexual Orientation, and Complications of the Orientation Model\nThere's a hilarious sticker that you can buy online at a website called TopPun.com. It\nshows a list with \"Homosexual Agenda\" written at the top. The list items are: \"1. Spend\ntime with family, 2. Be treated equally, 3. Buy milk.\" (You can also buy a keychain\nversion.)\nI love that because it so perfectly highlights how preposterous all those right-wing\naccusations about \"the gay agenda\" are. Actually, gay people just want to live their lives\nlike everyone else; the to-do list for most gay people looks a lot like most other people's.\nIn a way, that sticker also highlights some problems with the very concept of sexual\norientations -- the way we sort ourselves into groups based on sexuality and its apparent\ninnateness. Why do people have to insist on being so different from each other? A\nquestion that sometimes gets raised in BDSM contexts: is BDSM a \"sexual orientation\"?\nAnd I have such mixed feelings about that question. I feel intense BDSM as an incredibly\nimportant aspect of my sexuality, perhaps an innate one, but I don't want us to fall into\nthe same traps that beset homosexuality.\nI remember the first moment it occurred to me to consider BDSM an orientation -- the\nfirst time I used that word. I believe I was writing up my coming-out story at the time; I\nwas discussing the way I freaked out when I came into BDSM, and I wrote: In\nretrospect, it seems surreal that I reacted so badly to my BDSM orientation.\nI remember that I felt vaguely electrified at what I was saying, a little scared... but also\ncomforted. At the time, I hadn't had much contact with other sex theorists, and I thought I\nwas saying something radical. I was scared that my words might appear too radical to be\ntaken seriously. Also, since our culture mostly discusses the idea of \"orientation\" in\nregards to gay/ lesbian /bi /transgender /queer, it seemed to me that -- if I dared refer to it\nas \"my BDSM orientation\" -- then a comparison with LGBTQ was implied in my\nstatement.\nWould the world believe that my BDSM desires could be as \"real,\" as \"deep-rooted,\" as\n\"unavoidable\" as the sexual orientation of a gay/lesbian/bi/transgender/queer person?\nWould I offend GLBTQ people by implying that my sexual needs are as \"real,\" \"deeprooted\"\nand \"unavoidable\" as theirs?\nI later found out that some LGBTQ people do get offended by it, and others don't.\nSometime you end up with ridiculous arguments like this one from a comments thread on\nan incredibly BDSM-phobic blog: one person says, \"As a lesbian, I would like to say a\nsincere fuck you to people comparing BDSM to homosexuality,\" to which another person\nreplies, \"As a queer person myself, I would like to say a sincere fuck you to people who\nclaim that I ought to see my BDSM and my queerness differently.\" As for me, Clarisse,\nI'll be frank with you -- I've come to the conclusion that I don't have a dog in that fight,\nand I'm staying out of it. I'm straight as the day is long, but I've also been invited to speak\nabout BDSM at queer conventions and to write about BDSM on queer blogs. So I'll hang\nout with the people who are cool with me, and everyone else can kick me out of their\nLGBTQ circles as much as they want.\nBut I used to feel a lot more worried about how I'd be perceived for talking about BDSM\nas an orientation. Still, as weird as the concept of \"BDSM as an orientation\" felt when I\nfirst thought of it, it also felt right. When I looked back at my memories and previous\nactions, it was quite obvious that I have always had these needs, desires and fantasies.\nAcknowledging this, and applying the word \"orientation\" to BDSM, helped me come to\nterms with my BDSM identity.\nThe \"BDSM orientation\" idea cleared a mental path for me to think of BDSM as a inbuilt\npart of myself, like my bone structure or eye color. BDSM became something that it was\ndesirable to accept, come to terms with... even embrace. It was a hugely liberating way\nof thinking about it: if I thought of BDSM as an orientation, that meant I didn't have\nto worry about or fight it anymore.\nSince then, I've been so buried in sexuality theory and I've talked to so many BDSM\npeople that -- well, now the idea of a \"BDSM orientation\" seems kinda boring. I am\nreminded that it's a radical concept only when I talk to people who don't think about these\nthings all the time. I think that the idea of BDSM as an orientation occurs naturally to\npeople who think a lot about BDSM sexuality, because so many kinksters either know\nwe're BDSM people all along, or instantly recognize BDSM once we find it. Here's a\nquotation from an article about a BDSM-related legal case that quotes sexologist Charles\nMoser at the end, as he very eloquently describes how BDSM can be considered a sexual\norientation:\nWhen I talk to someone who is identifying as BDSM and ask them have you always felt\nthis way, and they almost always report that 'This has been the way I was all along. I\ndidn't realize it. I thought I was interested in more traditional male/female relationships\nbut now I realize that I really like the power and control aspects of relationship.'\n... They are very clear often that, 'my relationships which were vanilla were not fulfilling.\nI always felt like there was something missing. Now that I'm doing BDSM, I am fulfilled.\nThis feels really right to me. This really gets me to my core. It's who I am.'\n... And so in the same way as someone who is homosexual, they couldn't really change --\nthey somehow felt fulfilled in the same-sex relationship -- similarly in a BDSM\nrelationship or scenario, they similarly feel the same factors, and in my mind, that allows\nme to classify people who fit that as a sexual orientation. I cannot change someone who's\ninto BDSM to not be BDSM.\nThat's how I feel. Absolutely.\nAnd yet I disagree with Moser on one key point: not all BDSM people are like this. I\nknow that people exist who do BDSM, who don't feel it the same way I do. They don't\nfeel that it's been with them all along. It's not deep-rooted for them. It's not unavoidable,\nit's not necessary, it doesn't go to their core. They can change from being into BDSM to\nnot doing BDSM, because it's not built-in; it's just something they do sometimes, for fun.\nThere are also plenty of people who have equally strong feelings about their BDSM\nsexuality, but who have different BDSM preferences from mine. And that's totally okay\nwith me! I will always say that I've got no problem with whatever people want to do, as\nlong as it's kept among consenting adults.\nBut what does the existence of people like that mean for BDSM as an orientation? Are\nthey somehow less \"entitled\" to practice BDSM, because it's not as deep-rooted or\nimportant to them as it is for, say, me? No, that can't be true. I'm not going to claim that\nmy feelings are \"more real\" than theirs, or somehow more important, just because BDSM\ngoes straight to my core but not to theirs. They've got as much right as I do to practice\nthese activities, as long as they do it consensually.\nSo, where does that leave us? It means that BDSM is an orientation for some people, but\nnot for others. I'm fine with that. Does that mean we're done here? Well, no....\n... because if BDSM is an orientation for some people but not others, then we're in a bit of\na weird place when it comes to societal recognition. In the case I cited above, Charles\nMoser is claiming that we BDSMers can't change ourselves and that therefore, we don't\ndeserve to be stigmatized for our sexuality.\nOn the surface, this might seem reasonable, but actually, whether or not people can alter\ntheir sexual needs, there's no reason people shouldn't be able to do what they want\nwith other consenting adults. If any of us phrase the argument as: \"I can't change\nmyself, so please don't hate me!\" then we are implicitly saying, \"If I could change myself,\nI would... but I can't, so please have pity on me!\" In other words, we are implicitly\nsaying: \"BDSMers can't 'fix' our sexual needs -- it's not 'our fault' -- so please don't hate\nus.\"\nAnd when we say that, we are accepting and validating the way our culture tries to shame\nour sexuality. We are fundamentally agreeing with the opposition and begging for an\nexception, rather than trying to change the rule. We are calling BDSM a \"fault,\" rather\nthan stating that freely exercising sexuality is our \"right.\" When we make BDSM into\nan orientation, we are often casting BDSM sexuality as something that we would\n\"fix\" if we could. But BDSM is not broken in the first place!\nAlso, using the orientation argument leaves the entire segment of the population that\ndoesn't feel BDSM as an orientation standing out in the cold. If we go with the\norientation model, and say that it's okay for BDSM-identified people to practice BDSM\nonly because we feel it as a deep-rooted orientation... then we are implying that\nit's not okay for people to practice BDSM if they don't feel it as a deep-rooted\norientation.\nSomething like this has happened in some gay/lesbian communities: people who have sex\nwith folks of the same gender, but don't identify as strictly gay or lesbian, have\nsometimes been stigmatized within gay/lesbian communities or even disallowed from\ngay/lesbian gatherings. I understand that there are historical reasons that kind of thing\nhappened, and analyzing the phenomenon would take up a whole post. I'm pretty sure\nbooks have been written about it. But the point is that when it did happen, it left bisexual\npeople -- as well as others who don't fit neatly within the \"gay/lesbian orientation\" -- out\nin the cold. And I don't want to support that with BDSM.\nSo I've tended to avoid that kind of language. I think it is important to move away from \"I\ncan't help having these needs,\" and towards \"It's fundamentally unimportant whether we\ncan change our sexual desires; the only really important thing is whether or not we\npractice them consensually.\"\nBut...\nthere's always a but...\nI'll admit that I feel anxiety about abandoning the \"orientation model.\" I still haven't taken\nthe word \"orientation\" out of my BDSM overview lecture, because it is useful for\nconvincing people that BDSM is okay. Many people, at this point, have accepted the\nLGBTQ orientation as something that should not be stigmatized. The word \"orientation\"\ncan really help them understand what BDSM means to us and why it's not okay to\nstigmatize that, either.\nFurthermore, there are obviously people out there (like Charles Moser) who are seeking\nto protect BDSM legally, as a sexual orientation. They want to make BDSM a protected\nclass, so that we can't get fired or have our kids taken away or suffer other consequences\nfor being into BDSM anymore. If talking about BDSM as a sexual orientation means I\ncan worry less about those potential consequences, then is it worth it? Maybe.\nAnd, of course, I don't want to forget how much the idea of an \"orientation\" comforted\nme when I was first coming into BDSM. It made me feel so much better to recognize\nBDSM as an inbuilt part of myself. I don't want to take that comfort away from anyone\nelse.\nSo, when I try to campaign for general sexual freedom and acceptance -- \"orientation\" or\nno \"orientation\" -- I imagine that I'll still end up using the word sometimes. But I'll\nalways try to be conscious of it, and I'll always try to speak in ways that support this\nstatement:\nIt's fundamentally unimportant whether we can change our sexual desires; the only\nreally important thing is whether or not we practice them consensually.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/04/09/classic-repost-bdsm-as-a-sexual-orientationand-complications-of-the-orientation-model/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nS&M:\n[theory] BDSM \"versus\" Sex\nThis was originally published in two parts in 2011. I named the first part \"Divide and\nConquer,\" and the second part \"How Does It Feel?\" But as often happens when I split up\nmy long posts, people were already talking about points that I addressed in the second\npost while commenting on the first post -- before the second post was published.\n(Unfortunately, my commenters are at least as smart as I am, and they notice when I\nleave things out.) I've often struggled with length problems as a blogger. If I could write\nposts that are typical blog length, like 250-500 words, then I'd probably be a lot more\nsuccessful. But I just can't seem to write short, and since splitting up long posts is a bad\nidea too, I constantly feel frustrated by blogging... let alone platforms like Twitter! If you\nhave clever thoughts for how I can train myself to be a better short-form writer, email\nme. Seriously.\n* * *\nBDSM \"versus\" Sex\nEvery once in a while, someone will ask me a question about something BDSM-related\nthat I feel \"done with\"; I feel like I did all my thinking about those topics, years ago. But\nit's still useful to get those questions today, because it forces me to try and understand\nwhere my head was at, three to seven years ago. It forces me to calibrate my inner\nprocesses. I often think of these questions as the \"simple\" ones, or the \"101\" questions,\nbecause they are so often addressed in typical conversation among BDSMers. Then\nagain, lots of people don't have access to a BDSM community, or aren't interested in their\nlocal BDSM community for whatever reason. Therefore, it's useful for me to cover those\n\"simple\" questions on my blog anyway.\nPlus, just because a question is simple doesn't mean the question is not interesting.\nOne such question is the \"BDSM versus sex\" question. Is BDSM always sex? Is it always\nsexual? A lot of people see BDSM as something that \"always\" includes sex, or is \"always\nsexual in some way.\" In the documentary \"BDSM: It's Not What You Think!\", one\nfamous BDSM writer is quoted saying something like: \"I would say that eros is always\ninvolved in BDSM, even if the participants aren't doing anything that would look sexual\nto non-BDSMers.\"\nBut a lot of other people see BDSM, and the BDSM urge, as something that doesn't\nnecessarily have anything to do with sex -- that is separate from sex.\nI see two sides to this question: the political side, and the \"how does it feel?\" side. Both\nsides are intertwined; when it comes to sex, politics can't help shaping our experiences\n(and vice versa). I acknowledge this. And yet even when I try to account for that,\nthere is still something deeply different about the way my body feels my BDSM\nurges, as opposed to how my body feels sexual urges. I don't think that those bodily\ndifferences could ever quite go away, no matter how my mental angle on those processes\nchanged.\n* * *\nThe Political Side of BDSM versus Sex\n\"BDSM versus sex\" could be viewed as a facet of that constant and irritating question --\n\"What is sex, anyway?\" I've always found that the more you look at the line between\n\"what is sex\" and \"what is not sex,\" the more blurred the line becomes.\nFor example, recall that ridiculous national debate that happened across America when\nBill Clinton told us that he hadn't had sex with Monica -- and then admitted to getting a\nblowjob from her. Is oral sex sex? Maybe oral sex isn't sex! Flutter, flutter, argue, argue.\nIt is my experience that (cisgendered, heterosexual) women are often more likely to claim\nthat oral sex is not sex, while (cis, het) men are more likely to claim that oral sex is sex. I\nsuspect this is because women face steeper social penalties for having sex (no one wants\nto be labeled a \"slut\"), so we are typically more motivated to claim that sex acts \"don't\ncount\" as sex... whereas men are usually congratulated for having sex (more notches on\nthe bedpost!), so men are typically more motivated to claim that sex acts \"count\" as sex.\n(Unless they're Bill Clinton.)\nSo we already have this weird ongoing debate, about what \"qualifies\" as sex. And you\nthrow in fetishes such as BDSM, and everyone gets confused all over again. A cultural\nexample of this confusion came up in 2009, when a bunch of professional dominatrixes\ngot arrested in New York City... for being dominatrixes... which everyone previously\nbelieved was legal. Flutter, flutter, argue, argue, and it turns out that \"prostitution\" (which\nis illegal in New York) is defined as \"sexual conduct for money.\"\nBut what does \"sexual conduct\" mean? At least one previous court had set the\nprecedent that BDSM-for-pay is not the same as \"sexual conduct for money\"... and\nyet, in 2009, the Manhattan District Attorney's office decided that \"sexual conduct\"\nmeans \"anything that is arousing to the participants\"... and then decided that this\nsuddenly meant they ought to go arrest dominatrixes. It's not clear why the Manhattan\nDA did not, then, also begin arresting strippers. And what about random vanilla couples\non a standard date-type thing, where the woman makes eyes at the man over dinner, and\nthe man pays for the meal? Sounds like \"sexual conduct for money\" to me. Which could\ntotally be prostitution, folks, so watch your backs.\nIn his piece \"Is There Such A Thing As Kinky Sex?\", Dr. Marty Klein says that:\nIf practicing kinky sex makes you \"other,\" not one of \"us,\" if it has non-sexual\nimplications, if it means you're defective or dangerous -- who wants that? And so as\n\"kinky sex\" and its practitioners are demonized, everyone is concerned -- am I one of\n\"those people\"? It makes people fear their fantasies or curiosity, which then acquire too\nmuch power. It leads to secrecy between partners, as people withhold information about\ntheir preferences or experiences.\n... I'd like to destroy the idea of binary contrast -- that kinky and non-kinky sex are\nclearly different. Instead, I suggest that kinky and vanilla sex are parts of a continuum,\nthe wide range of human eroticism. We all slide side to side along that continuum during\nour lives, sometimes in a single week. We don't need to fear our fantasies, curiosity, or\n(consensual) sexual preferences. They don't make us bad or different, just human. Some\npeople like being emotional outlaws. They'll always find a way to get the frisson of\notherness. But most people don't want to live that way. So ending kink's status as\ndangerous and wrong, and its practitioners as \"other,\" is the most liberating thing we\ncan do -- for everyone.\nThat's certainly reasonable from a political standpoint. I've made similar arguments.\n(Some folks, such as the brilliant male submissive writer maymay, also argue against the\ncommon idea that \"kink\" is limited to \"BDSM\"; they prefer an expansive definition of\n\"kink\" that denotes a vaster cornucopia of sexuality.)\nPlus, I even suspect that a lot of the distinctions made by BDSMers ourselves are\nbased far more on stigma than sense. For example, when I was younger, I went through\na period where I couldn't stand to have the word \"submissive\" applied to myself. I\ninsisted that I was into BDSM solely for the physical sensation, and swore I would never\never do something solely submission-oriented (such as wearing a collar). It was like I\ncould only handle BDSM as long as I distanced myself from the power elements; the\npower elements carried too much stigma in my head for me to acknowledge them... yet.\nI also used to carefully separate \"BDSM\" from \"sex\" in my head. Part of me felt like, \"If\nmy desire for pain and power is sexual, then it's weird. If it's not sexual, then it's less\nweird.\" (It looks strange when I type it, now, but I guess that's how sexual stigma works:\nit rarely holds up against the clear light of day.) It took me a while to integrate sexuality\ninto my BDSM practice. In contrast, I once met a couple who told me that it took them a\nlong time to do BDSM that wasn't part of sex. In their heads, the thought was more like:\n\"If the desire for pain and power is sexual, then it's not weird. But if it's not sexual, then\nit's really weird.\"\nI've heard of plenty of dungeons where sex is not allowed -- sometimes for legal reasons,\nbut sometimes because there is actually a social standard against it: people are like,\n\"Dude, let's not get our nice pure BDSM all dirty by including sex.\" (Note: My\nexperience is primarily with dungeons owned by \"lifestyle\" BDSMers -- \"lifestyle\" being\na clumsy word that attempts to denote those of us who are motivated to do BDSM for\nreasons other than money. While there is some overlap between \"lifestyle\" BDSM and\nprofessional BDSM, the overlap can be surprisingly rare, and professional BDSM is often\nbanned at lifestyle BDSM parties. Lifestyle dungeons are often non-profit organizations,\nand often function more like community centers than moneymaking venues. I understand\nthat some professional dungeons have a \"no sex\" rule out of a desire to protect the\nboundaries of dominatrixes who work there, who may not wish to be asked to engage in\nsex.)\nThere are also plenty of cultural groups who do things that look suspiciously like\nBDSM... who insist that they have nothing to do with BDSM. For example, I've heard of\nspanking clubs whose members get really mad if you dare bring BDSM up in their\npresence.\nAnd then there's groups like Taken In Hand, a quasi-conservative organization. Actual\ntestimonial from the Taken In Hand site:\nThere are lots of websites for people in the BDSM, D/s, DD (domestic discipline) and\nspanking communities. There are websites for people who belong to religions that\nadvocate male-head-of-household marriage. There are even websites for Christians who\nare interested in BDSM. But there are very few websites for people who are interested in\nmale-led intimate relationships but who are not interested in all that the above\ncommunities associate with this kind of relationship (jargon, clothes, etc.) Some of us\ndon't even like thinking of this as a lifestyle.\nWell, my friend, you know what... you can refuse to call yourself BDSM all you want,\nand you can reject our \"jargon\" all you want, and you can \"dislike\" thinking of this\n\"lifestyle\" until the end of time... and you have every right to insist that we have nothing\nto do with you. But when your site has posts that include comments like \"When my\nhusband behaves in a dominant manner I basically swoon,\" or have titles like \"Don't\nforget your whip,\" well... I'm just saying.\nAlso, since you mention rejecting BDSM \"clothes\"? I'll just say that I can be an\nastoundingly badass domme in a t-shirt. And I have done so. Multiple times.\nPersonally, I am particularly frustrated by the stigmatizing idea that BDSM has nothing\nto do with love. Sometimes I encounter this idea that BDSM has to be separated from sex\nbecause BDSM has nothing to do with sex, whereas sex supposedly \"should\" be about\nlove. The truth is that both BDSM and sex are very different for different people,\nemotions-wise. Although many people experiment with \"casual BDSM,\" the same way\nmany people experiment with \"casual sex,\" a stereotype that BDSMers cannot find love\nin the act is wrong and absurd.\nSo yeah. Nowadays, many of these \"BDSM versus sex\" reactions strike me as being born\nout of pure, irrational stigma. As Dr. Klein noted, these reactions are usually born of the\nterrible human urge to exclude: to find ways to differentiate ourselves from \"those\npeople.\" Humans apparently love to think things like: \"I'm not like those people. It\ndoesn't matter if I, for example, write extensive rape fantasy fiction! That couldn't\npossibly be BDSM! Because I'm not a BDSMer! Because BDSM is dirty.\"\nBut we shouldn't necessarily blame people for this instinct to reject and categorize: the\ninstinct is one that comes from being scared and oppressed... because the social penalties\nfor \"getting it wrong\" are high. Remember, those New York City dominatrixes thought\nthey were \"safe\" from the law as long as BDSM didn't count as sex. But as soon as\nsomeone decided BDSM \"counted as\" sex, those dominatrixes were arrested.\nIt's just one more example of how sexual stigma for \"different kinds of sex\" is constantly\nintertwined. No type of consensual sexuality can express itself freely until people agree\nthat \"among consenting adults, there is no 'should'.\" The Romans, those ancient\nimperialists, used to say: \"Divide and conquer.\" When consensual sexualities are scared\nof each other, we will continue to be conquered. As long as \"vanilla\" people are afraid\nof \"BDSM\"... as long as \"BDSMers\" are afraid of being seen as \"sexual\"... as long\nas the social penalties for being a \"slut\" or a \"whore\" are incredibly steep... as long\nas sex workers are stigmatized and criminalized... everyone will be bound by these\noppressive standards.\n* * *\nThe Embodied Side of BDSM versus Sex\nAlthough Part 1 was all about how the divide between \"BDSM\" and \"sex\" is often\nnonsensical, or purely political, or socially constructed... that doesn't mean that the\ndivide does not exist. I once had a conversation about ignoring social constructs with a\nwise friend, who noted dryly that: \"One-way streets are a social construct. That doesn't\nmean we should ignore them.\" Just because the outside world influences our sexuality,\ndoes not mean that our sexual preferences are invalid.\nSome polyamorous BDSMers have very different rules about having sex with outsiders,\nas opposed to doing BDSM with outsiders. For example, during the time when I was\nconsidering a transition to polyamory, I myself had a couple relationships where we were\nsexually monogamous -- yet my partners agreed that I could do BDSM with people who\nweren't my partner. Those particular partners felt jealous and threatened by the idea\nof me having sex with another man, but they didn't mind if I did BDSM with\nanother man. Maybe the feelings of those partners only arose because they categorized\n\"BDSM\" and \"sex\" into weirdly different socially-constructed ways... but those\npartners' feelings were nonetheless real, and their feelings deserved respect.\nAnd there are also unmistakable ways that BDSM feels different from sex. There is\nsomething, bodily, that is just plain different about BDSM, as opposed to sex. I often\nfind myself thinking of \"BDSM feelings\" and \"sexual feelings\" as flowing down two\nparallel channels in my head... sometimes these channels intersect, but sometimes they're\nfar apart. The BDSM urge strikes me as deeply different, separate, from the sex urge. It\ncan be fun to combine BDSM and sex, but there are definitely times when I want BDSM\nthat feel very unlike most times when I want sex.\nThe biggest political reason why it's difficult to discuss this is the way in which we\ncurrently conceptualize sexuality through \"orientations\": we have built a cultural\n\"orientation model\" focused on the idea that \"acceptable\" sexuality is \"built-in,\" or\n\"innate.\" Some BDSMers consider BDSM an \"orientation\" -- and I, myself, once found\nthat thinking of BDSM as an orientation was extremely helpful in coming to terms with\nmy BDSM desires. But one thing I don't like about the orientation model now is that it\nmakes us sound like we're apologizing. \"Poor little me! It's not my fault I'm straight! Or a\ndomme! Whatever!\" Why would any of these things be faults in the first place? Our\nbodies are our own, our experiences are our own, and our consent is our own to give.\nThe orientation model is one of the cultural factors that makes it hard to discuss sensory,\nsensual experiences without defaulting to sexuality. As commenter saurus pointed out on\nthe Feministe version of part 1 of this post:\nSometimes I think that we have compulsions, needs or \"fetishes\" that aren't sexual, but\nlumping them in with sexuality is sometimes the most convenient or socially manageable\nway to deal with them or get those needs met. They might even physically arouse us for a\nvariety of reasons, but that might be a side effect instead of the act's inherent nature.\nWhich is not to say that every act can be cleanly cleaved into \"sexual\" and \"non-sexual\"\n-- of course not. But I think we lack a language around these needs that doesn't use\nsexuality. I see a lot of groundbreaking work coming out of the asexual and disability\njustice communities in this regard (which is just to say that I find the folks in these\ngroups are churning out some incredible ways to \"queer\" conventional dominant ideas\nabout sexuality; not that they never have sex or whatever).\nI think one answer to that is to just open up the definition of sexuality to include these\nthings, but as someone who identifies vehemently not as \"sex positive\" but as \"sex nonjudgmental,\"\nI know I don't personally want all my shit to be lumped in with sexuality. It\njust makes me picture some sex judgmental person insisting that \"oh, that's totally\nsexual.\"\nI, Clarisse, can certainly attest that it's common for people to have BDSM encounters that\nare \"just\" BDSM -- \"no sex involved.\" For example -- an encounter where one partner\nwhips the other, or gets whipped, and there's no genital contact or even discussion of\ngenitals. And I'd like to stress that when I have encounters like that, they can be very\nsatisfying without involving sex. The release -- the high -- I get from a heavy BDSM\nencounter can be its own reward.\nI've also had BDSM encounters where I got turned on...\n... but I didn't feel turned on until later, or afterwards, or until my partner did something\nspecific to draw out my desire. For example -- I remember that in one intense BDSM\nencounter as a domme, I wound up the encounter and pulled away from my partner. We\nhad both been sitting down; I stood up and took off the metal claws I'd been using to rip\nhim up. (Secretly, the claws were banjo picks. Do-It-Yourself BDSM is awesome.)\nThen I leaned over my partner to pick something up. I had thought we were pretty much\ndone, but he seized me as I leaned over, and he pulled me close and kissed my neck, and I\nliterally gasped in shock. My sexual desire spiked so hard... I practically melted into his\narms. And yet if you'd asked me, moments before, whether I was turned on... I would\nhave said \"no.\"\nOne way to think about it might be that sometimes, BDSM \"primes\" me so that I'm\nmore receptive to sexual energy. It's not that BDSM is exactly a sexual turn-on in itself;\nsometimes it is, but that's actually surprisingly rare. Yet BDSM often... gets my blood\nflowing?... and seems to \"open the floodgates,\" so sexual hormones can storm through\nmy body.\nAnd just in case this wasn't complex enough for you... on the other hand, I've had BDSM\nencounters where my partner tried to take it sexual, and I wasn't interested. It's almost\nlike there's a BDSM cycle that I often get into, and once the cycle is sufficiently\nadvanced, I can't easily shift out of it.\nSometimes, when I'm near the \"peak\" of the BDSM cycle, then being interrupted for any\nreason -- sex, or anything else -- is absolutely horrible. I'd rather be left on the edge of\norgasm, burning with sexual desire, than be hurt until I almost cry. The emotion becomes\na stubborn lump in my throat; becomes balled up in my chest. At times like that, it almost\nfeels hard to breathe.\nA while back, a reporter named Mac McClelland who worked in Haiti made a splash by\nwriting an article about how she used \"violent sex\" to ease her Post-Traumatic Stress\nDisorder. I briefly reported on the article for Feministe, but at the time, I didn't share\nmany of my thoughts about what she wrote. One thing I did say was that the reporter\ndidn't use any BDSM terminology -- at least not that I spotted. She didn't seem to\nconceptualize her desire for \"violent sex\" as a BDSM thing at all. Interestingly, a\nFeministe commenter named Jadey, who has experience with kink, also didn't\nconceptualize the reporter's article that way. Jadey wrote:\nI don't think she's bad or wrong, and I don't think her method of coping with her PTSD is\nbad or wrong.... [Yet] I've got a kink/BDSM background, but that's not what she's\ndescribing here. She's talking about something far different, and I can't understand the\nexperience she describes with Isaac. It is... incomprehensible.\nI want to stress here that I, Clarisse Thorn, have never been diagnosed with Post-\nTraumatic Stress Disorder. (And I've undergone plenty of analysis, so I'm sure that if I\nhad PTSD, someone would have noticed by now.) And just in case it needs to be said\nagain, I'll also stress that I have no intention of telling anyone else how to define their\nown experiences. And just in case it needs to be said again, there is a big difference\nbetween consenting BDSM and abuse.\nBut unlike Jadey, when I read the original \"violent sex\" article, the reporter's description\nof her encounter sounded a lot like some of my preferences... indeed, it sounded like\nsome of the BDSM encounters I've had. For example, the reporter writes:\n\"Okay,\" my partner said. \"I love you, okay?\" I said, I know, okay. And with that he was\non me, forcing my arms to my sides, then pinning them over my head, sliding a hand up\nunder my shirt when I couldn't stop him. The control I'd lost made my torso scream with\nanxiety; I cried out desperately as I kicked myself free.... When I got out from under him\nand started to scramble away, he simply caught me by a leg or an upper arm or my hair\nand dragged me back. By the time he pinned me by my neck with one forearm so I was\nforced to use both hands to free up space between his elbow and my windpipe, I'd largely\nexhausted myself.\nAnd just like that, I'd lost. It's what I was looking for, of course. But my body -- my hardfighting,\nadrenaline-drenched body -- reacted by exploding into terrible panic.... I did\nnot enjoy it in the way a person getting screwed normally would. But as it became clear\nthat I could endure it, I started to take deeper breaths. And my mind stayed there, stayed\npresent even when it became painful.... My body felt devastated but relieved; I'd lost, but\nsurvived. After he climbed off me, he gathered me up in his arms. I broke into a thousand\npieces on his chest, sobbing so hard that my ribs felt like they were coming loose.\n... Isaac pulled my hair away from my wet face, repeating over and over and over\nsomething that he probably believed but that I had to relearn. \"You are so strong,\" he\nsaid. \"You are so strong. You are so strong.\"\nSounds extremely familiar to me.\nNow, it's not like I have BDSM encounters like that all the time; indeed, experiences of\nthat type are relatively rare for me. But the reporter's description doesn't sound \"far\ndifferent\" from what I've experienced. Certainly not \"incomprehensible.\" There's only\none big difference, actually: I've never had such an intense BDSM experience in which\nmy partner also had penis-in-vagina sex with me. (I'm assuming the reporter means\n\"penis-in-vagina\" sex when she talks about \"getting screwed\", but I could be wrong.)\nHonestly, I'm not sure why I would want to combine vaginal sex with an experience like\nthat. Vaginal sex strikes me, personally, as kinda incidental to what I'd get out of it. But\nmaybe I'll try it sometime and it'll be the greatest thing in the world; we'll see, I guess.\nSometimes I find that I've still got a \"BDSM versus sex\" distinction to work out, although\nI seem to have comfortably settled into the frameworks I've created. One of my very first\nblog entries, back in 2008, was called \"Casual Sex? Casual Kink?\", and I spent the whole\nthing musing about whether I was more or less okay with casual BDSM than I was with\ncasual sex.\nThese days, I find that I'm kinda okay with both casual sex and casual BDSM, but I much\nprefer those experiences within intimate relationships. Make no mistake, my friends:\nBDSM can include a great deal of love and connection... at least as much as sex.\nTo hammer the point home, let me tell you about what happened after I broke up with a\nmuch-beloved ex-boyfriend: Mr. Inferno. It was back when I was very focused on being\nmonogamous with my partners. Mr. Inferno broke up with me, and a month or two later I\nhad the chance to have an overnight BDSM encounter with another man, so I took it.\nThere was no genital contact; the whole encounter was limited to this guy giving me\norders, and hurting me until I cried.\nBut I remember, even as I slipped into the familiar emotional cycle, that I couldn't let go:\nI couldn't let go because I felt like I was betraying Mr. Inferno. He'd broken my heart, but\non some level I felt like I still belonged to him. It was wrong, wrong, wrong for me to cry\nin someone else's arms. The wrongness rang through me like a bell. It was so impossible,\nunbearable -- all I could think was how it should have been Mr. Inferno. I choked on the\ntears. I couldn't lose myself in them.\nLater, I mentioned to my partner that one of my ex-boyfriends (not Mr. Inferno) had\ntrouble dealing with my BDSM desires. \"Ah,\" my partner said. \"That explains why you\nhad trouble letting yourself cry.\" I decided to nod; to let him think he knew what was\nblocking me off. It seemed simpler.\nIn the morning, I had breakfast with my partner. We hugged and split up, and I went for a\nwalk until I found a local creek. I sat next to the creek and I closed my eyes and I let the\nhelpless tears slip down my cheeks.\nI'd felt (and I'd known others who felt) this way after the dissolution of a sexual\nrelationship. But I had never imagined that such a reaction of intense bodily loyalty could\napply to BDSM as well as sex. I hadn't anticipated that I'd feel such heartbreaking,\nvisceral loss just because I let another man hurt me.\nSo different, and yet so the same.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet in two parts:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/10/09/bdsm-versus-sex-part-1-political-concerns/\nand\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/10/14/bdsm-versus-sex-part-2-how-does-it-feel/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nS&M:\n[theory] BDSM Roles, \"Topping From The Bottom,\" and \"Service\nTop\"\nI wrote this post in 2011.\n* * *\nBDSM Roles, \"Topping From The Bottom,\" and \"Service Top\"\nI often say that all consensual sexuality is okay. Open relationships? S&M? Same-sex\npartnerships? One-night stands? Porn? I could care less how people have sex, as long as\nthe people involved are consenting adults. This means that most of the interesting and\nimportant questions are about consent: how do we make sure that we always have\nconsensual sex? How do we ensure that we're always respecting our own boundaries and\nour partners' boundaries? How do we talk about our preferences and our consent? I write\na lot about sexual communication for this reason.\nEvery once in a while, though, there's something interesting to discuss besides consent.\n(Totally weird, I know!) One of those interesting things is stereotypes. Also interesting:\nbad dynamics in the BDSM community.\nOne example of a bad, weird dynamic is the \"one true way\" thing. Some people act like\nthere are \"right\" ways and \"wrong\" ways to do consensual BDSM -- as if some\nconsensual BDSM is more legit than other consensual BDSM. Often, people do this via\nwhat we call \"role policing\": they make claims about \"real submission\" and \"real\ndominance.\" (Even worse, people will sometimes act like dominant people are socially\n\"better\" or \"more important\" than submissive people. Or they'll act like men are\n\"inherently\" dominant, or women are \"inherently\" submissive. It's a clusterfuck! Thomas\nMacAulay Millar has a great essay about this called \"Domism.\")\nExamples of role policing might include:\n* \"If you were really submissive, then you would be serving my dinner right now instead\nof having me serve myself.\"\n* \"If you were really dominant, then you would pay for my drinks.\"\n* \"If you were really submissive, then you wouldn't be confident enough to write a blog\nabout your sex life.\" (Not that I'm biased or anything.)\nSometimes these are hilarious light-hearted jokes. But sometimes they're not. Sometimes\nthey're bullshit, and they make people feel as though they're \"bad at submission\" or \"bad\nat dominance.\" Also, it gets really silly when we start thinking about switches -- people\nwho can feel comfortable in the dominant role or the submissive role, such as myself.\nOne very common, relevant assumption is that dominant people always enjoy inflicting\npain: that sadists and dominants are always the same group. They're not! Sometimes\npeople are into sadism, or into dominance, or maybe they're into a lot of sadism but a\nlittle dominance, or whatever. The same thing goes for submission: sometimes people are\nsubmissive and like taking pain, but sometimes people are submissive without being\nmasochistic, or maybe they're into a little bit of submission and a lot of masochism, or\nwhatever.\nOr maybe they're masochists who like ordering their partners to hurt them. I once threw a\nmemorable party at which my then-boyfriend, a mostly-submissive gentleman, arranged\nfor a bunch of our friends to grab me and hold me down while he ate cake off my body.\nAs he did this, I clearly recall shouting at him: \"You better hurt me, or I'm going to\nsafeword on your ass.\" So he hurt me! It was great.\nBecause \"submissive\" and \"masochist\" aren't always the same thing -- and \"dominant\"\nand \"sadist\" aren't always the same thing -- the BDSM community uses the terms\n\"bottom\" and \"top.\" A \"bottom\" is a blanket term for a submissive and/or a masochist --\nthe receiving partner. A \"top\" is a blanket term for a dominant and/or a sadist -- the\npartner who is providing sensation. The point is to have words that indicate who is giving\nand who is receiving, without making claims about each partner's preferences. (These\nwords can also be used as verbs. For example, if I am \"topping,\" then I am in the\ndominant and/or sadistic position.)\nAnd yet! Even though we have these handy terms \"top\" and \"bottom,\" which are\nspecifically designed to help us avoid making assumptions, people end up making\nassumptions. There are two common BDSM community phrases that are often deployed\nin tones of disgust and irritation. One of those phrases is \"topping from the bottom.\" The\nother phrase is \"service top.\"\n\"Topping from the bottom\" indicates a person who exercises power in the relationship,\ndespite being in the \"bottom\" position. There's nothing wrong with doing that, as long as\nboth partners consent. But some people talk about \"topping from the bottom\" like it's bad\n-- as if power ought to belong to one side or the other; as if the bottom should never\nexpress preferences or make decisions about what's going on. Which is ridiculous.\nI'll grant that it can be annoying if I'm trying to be a top, and my partner isn't listening or\nisn't doing what I want. But in those cases, it's important to pay attention to what is\nactually going on. Is my partner resisting because he actually doesn't want to do what\nwe're doing? In that case, I should respect his preferences. Or maybe my partner is\nresisting because he wants me to punish him. Or maybe we just have bad chemistry!\nWhatever. The point is, \"topping from the bottom\" isn't inherently a bad thing. \"Topping\nfrom the bottom\" doesn't make the bottom into a \"bad submissive\" or whatever. It just\nmeans that either the person is trying to communicate, or the person is looking for a\ncertain kind of push-pull dynamic.\nSimultaneously, there's the phrase \"service top.\" It's basically the same thing in reverse. A\n\"service top\" is a top who enjoys topping in line with his partner's desires. And once\nagain, some people act like this is a bad thing -- as if service tops \"aren't dominant\nenough.\" But it's not inherently a bad thing! If a service top is doing things just because\nher partner likes them... then good for her!\nI sometimes use phrases like \"topping from the bottom\" and \"service top\" to describe\ndynamics of a relationship: to talk about what is actually going on. But that's because I\ndon't think there's anything wrong with topping from the bottom or being a service top. I\ntry to avoid joking around about it unless I know that the person I'm talking to is not\nsensitive about the topic. And I really don't like it when people use those phrases while\nrole policing.\nBDSM can carry an incredible emotional charge, and a lot of the time, people will want\ncomfort and snuggles after doing BDSM together. Sometimes, part of that comfort and\nsnuggles includes reassuring the partner: \"I know you just beat the shit out of me until I\ncried; I enjoyed it -- I still like you and think you're a good person.\" Or, \"I know you\ncalled your safeword while I was hurting you; I still think you're a beautiful submissive\nand you did a great job -- in fact I love it when you call your safeword because it helps\nme understand you better.\" I think that in these cases it's totally okay to say something\nlike, \"You're such a good submissive.\" But it's so important to keep in mind that there\nisn't some kind of submission that's inherently \"better\" than any other kind -- or\ndominance that's \"better\" -- or sadism, masochism, whatever.\nAnd here is the part of the entry where I pull aside the mask and reveal that even though I\nclaimed I wouldn't talk about consent... I was secretly talking about consent all along!\nThe consent problem here is that role policing can be used to mess with people's\nconsent, because role policing can be used to pressure people. If a person wants to feel\nlike a \"real submissive,\" and you tell them that \"real submissives\" always receive anal\nsex... then the person might accept anal sex even if he doesn't really want to... because he\nwants to be a \"real submissive.\"\nI have personally witnessed accusations of \"topping from the bottom\" or \"service top\"\nbeing used to hurt people who were just trying to communicate, or arrange a relationship\nthat they liked. For example: \"I thought you were a submissive. Why are you asking me\nto tie you up? Stop topping from the bottom! I'm the dominant partner, I make the\ndecisions!\"\nAn important facet of consent is trying to create a pressure-free environment, so that all\npartners feel comfortable talking about what they want. Sometimes, it can be very hard to\ncreate that environment, because pressure isn't always easy to see or understand -- but if\nwe want maximum consent power, then we have to do our best. One way to create a\npressure-free environment is to be careful about phrases like \"topping from the bottom\"\nand \"service top\" and the role policing that can go along with those phrases.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/11/12/bdsm-roles-topping-from-the-bottom-andservice-top/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nFEMINISM:\n[theory] \"Inherent Female Submission\": The Wrong Question\nI wrote this post in mid-2011. Perhaps you can tell that I was in the depths of my\nobsession with pickup artists at the time... those guys talk about \"inherent female\nsubmission\" ad nauseam. Not all pickup artists are evil and misogynist, but the ones who\nare love to beat this horse.\n* * *\n\"Inherent Female Submission\": The Wrong Question\nI get a certain question occasionally, from straight dudes who've had a number of sexual\npartners. It goes something like this:\nAll the women I've slept with liked pain. They asked me to hurt them or to dominate them\nin bed. I did it, and enjoyed it; I loved how much it turned them on... it turned them on a\nlot. But I keep thinking about it now. Why are all women into being submissive and/or\nmasochistic in bed? What does that mean?\nThey ask me this question in vaguely worried tones. Sometimes they say things like, \"It's\nreally creepy.\" It is obvious that these dudes are rather concerned about this Terrible\nTruth.\nHere's my short answer for those guys: If you know women who are submissive and/or\nmasochistic in bed, that means those particular women like being submissive and/or\nmasochistic in bed. It doesn't mean anything else.\nYou're still here? Ah, well. I figured that wouldn't satisfy. So here's a longer answer:\nFirstly, if you're a straight dude, and you're drawing conclusions about \"all women\" based\non the women you get involved with, then stop. Just stop. Even if you have slept with\nzillions of women, you don't actually know what all women want, because:\nA) Your experience of women is limited to women who got involved with you. You\nare screening for certain qualities, sometimes consciously, and sometimes unconsciously\nor by accident. If you tend to enjoy the dominant role, for example, or if you use a\ndominant style of flirtation, then you could be screening for submissive female partners,\nwhether you intend to or not.\nB) Everyone has biases, including you. I love the old saying: \"When all you have is a\nhammer, everything looks like a nail.\" If you have a bias towards seeing women as\nsexually submissive (and you almost certainly do, because female sexual submission is a\nhugely prevalent cultural trope), then you're more likely to see female submission in\nplaces where it does not exist.\nC) Women, like people of all genders, are demonstrably varied. You really don't think\nnon-submissive straight women exist? Why then, it must be so inconvenient when I point\nyou to the work of blatantly dominant women, huh? It's shocking, I know... next I'll be\ntelling you that queer and asexual women exist! (Not to mention women who switch\namong roles -- from submissive to dominant, from sadistic to masochistic. I primarily go\nfor submissive masochism, but still, I myself play for both teams.)\nThe thing is, though... no matter how many holes I can poke in these dudes' anecdotal\n\"data,\" I can't bring myself to worry like they do. Even if a brilliant, well-reviewed study\ncame out tomorrow and proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that 100% of women are\nsubmissive masochists in bed, I wouldn't care. (I bet you my left ear this study will never\nhappen, but I'm just saying, even if it did, I wouldn't care.)\nLet me say it really clearly: Even if most women are submissive masochists in bed\n(and I'm not convinced most women are), there's nothing wrong with that. I don't\ncare.\nWhy don't I care? Because all this anxiety and argument about submission -- and in\nparticular, what it means for women to be submissive; whether all women are\nsubmissive; whether women are \"inherently\" or \"biologically\" submissive; whether\nBDSM is an orientation or not... this is all the wrong question.\nI'll note that the research seems to indicate that more kinky women are submissive than\ndominant. Of course, this doesn't necessarily indicate anything about the tastes of women\nwho don't identify as kinky. And it's probably biased by culture, in that everything from\nfashion photos to romance novels emphasizes female submission and male dominance.\nWithin BDSM culture, female dominance and male submission are often disappeared,\nmuch to the justified frustration of actual female dominants and male submissives. When\nall you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail -- sometimes including our own\npsyches and sexualities.\nPlus, if the only available patterns for kink emphasize something a person doesn't like,\nthen that person will probably avoid kink. Note that in the research I linked to, for\nexample, the percentage of submissive women was higher in samples from within the\nBDSM subculture than in samples from outside the BDSM subculture... perhaps because\nmany BDSM subcultural gatherings emphasize female submission and thereby alienate\nwomen who are primarily dominant. Anyway, regardless... this is still the wrong\nquestion.\nIn short, \"inherent female submission\" is the wrong question.\nCertainly, I've fought through a lot of personal fears about what my interest in BDSM\nmeant for me as a feminist... but these days I have trouble understanding what, exactly,\ngot me so upset. I can't believe how long it took me to outthink those fears. Now, it just\nseems instinctively obvious to me that:\n1) The only reason these conversations happen at all is that BDSM, and especially\nsubmission, is seen as broken and problematic and screwed-up and a sign of\nweakness. What if we viewed S&M proclivities as a superpower rather than a\nperversion? What if submission and masochism, in particular, were viewed as signs of\nstrength and endurance and emotional complexity, rather than weakness?\n2) Sexual kinks don't necessarily affect one's performance in non-sexual fields. A\nsexually submissive woman won't make a bad CEO (at least, not because she's sexually\nsubmissive). I mean, come on, it's not like there aren't sexually submissive men in\npowerful corporate positions. When I was younger I remember being scared that, in some\nbizarre way, I was betraying women's liberation by being sexually submissive; this seems\nridiculous to me now. That fear can only survive in a culture where people are looking\nfor excuses -- no matter how flimsy -- to control and disempower women. Because it\ndoesn't make any damn sense on its own.\n3) Rape is still rape. Everyone still has a right to consent, including submissives. A\nsubmissive partner (of any gender) must be able to withdraw consent, and a dominant\npartner (of any gender) must make space for them to withdraw consent. It's always great\nwhen both partners can have an honest conversation about desire, trying to avoid pressure\nand unfair expectations (whether those expectations arise from sexist culture or from\nwhatever else). Safewords are one frequently-recommended communication tactic for\nthose who have rape fantasies, although they aren't the only tactic. What really burns me\nabout many discussions of \"inherent female submission\" is that they have horrible\novertones of blaming the victim and justifying rape... much like \"she was wearing a short\nskirt, so she was asking for it.\" In reality, \"inherent female submission\" says absolutely\nnothing about women's right to choose our partners and protect our bodily integrity.\nFemale submissives have made it perfectly clear that we do, in fact, claim that right.\nI think most of the dudes who ask this question come to me, a feminist, and they ask this\nquestion in hushed and worried tones, because they are decent guys and they are\nconcerned about The Consequences Of This Terrible Truth. I'd venture a guess that\nthey've met other dudes who talk nonstop about how women are vain and stupid and\nhysterical and, snicker snicker, why do we let those dumb bitches even vote and, oh by\nthe way, did you know that lots of girls like to be choked and isn't that sooo significant...?\nAnd so these decent guys who are talking to me -- they have learned to associate\ndiscussions of female sexual submission with anti-feminism, and with attempts to\ndisempower women in other spheres.\nBeing decent guys, this worries them, because they know that people of all genders\ndeserve equal opportunity. But it is all a red herring! It's a series of illusions thrown up by\nBDSM stigma; by the idea that sexual kinks always mean something about the rest of a\nperson's life; by people who don't comprehend that everyone has the right to consent; and\nby blatant, uncomplicated misogyny! Female sexual submission isn't even close to a\nthreat to women's liberation, unless we allow it to be. If we weren't constantly forced to\ndeal with the broken assumptions of a broken misogynist culture, this question would\nnever occur to anyone!\nIt doesn't matter nearly as much what the cultural patterns are around sexual submission,\nas it does how we deal with sexual submission. If your partner is submissive, you can\nrespect their desires and also respect them as a person. As I already noted, in BDSM this\nmeans communicating carefully, like with safewords and/or other tactics. Some people\ncan have great sexual communication that's totally non-verbal -- but I always encourage\nexplicit verbal communication because for many people, it's easier to make intentions and\ndesires clear that way, and tactics like safewords provide a fallback in case there's a\nmistake.\nSo: what does \"inherent female submission\" mean for women, for feminism, for equal\nrights, for women who work, for powerful women? For housewives? For disabled\nwomen? For female rape survivors? For rape survivors of other genders?\nSay it with me now: It's the wrong question. The mere act of asking this question implies\na cultural context that is seeking excuses to disempower women. Female sexual\nsubmission means nothing...\n... except what every woman wants it to mean, for herself.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/07/01/inherent-female-submission-the-wrongquestion/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nMANLINESS:\n[theory] Fifty Shades of Grey, Fight Club, and the Complications of\nMale Dominance\nI wrote this in early 2012, when everyone and their brother was talking about the\namazingly successful fanfiction-turned-BDSM-smut Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, by E.L.\nJames. (The online version of this post contains a bunch of relevant current links at the\nend.) It's one of my rare attempts at pegging an article to a recent news item; I had been\nplanning to write this article for months, but Fifty Shades gave me an opportunity to\nactually do it. My main goal as a sex writer has always been to put forth analysis that's\nresponsive to the conversations I hear a lot, yet independent of the latest craze. For one\nthing, I almost never care to track what Everyone Is Talking About Right This Minute!!,\nand I'm irritated to think that I ought to do so. But I've come to reluctantly understand\nthat responding to current news is one of the best ways to get more eyeballs on my work,\nso I'm trying to do more of that. I've also been encouraged in that direction by employers\n-- most notably the gender-lens website RoleReboot.org, where I took on the role of Sex\n+ Relationships Section Editor in late 2011. A slightly shorter version of this article was\noriginally published there.\n* * *\nFifty Shades of Grey, Fight Club, and the Complications of Male Dominance\nMuch is being made of the highly successful S&M erotica novel Fifty Shades of Grey.\nPeople are blaming feminism for making women into submissives, blaming feminism for\npreventing women from being submissives, blaming women for having sexual desires at\nall, and a whole lot of other boring and typical stuff that comes up in any conversation\nabout women and S&M. News flash: it's not the feminist revolution that is \"causing\"\nwomen to have fantasies of submission. S&M fantasies have been around since the\nbeginning of time. (And the 1950s S&M-sensation book, The Story of O, was much better\nwritten than Fifty Shades of Grey.)\nAs an S&M writer, I hear a lot of allegations about how \"all\" (or \"almost all\") women are\nsexually submissive and how this must Mean Something. This is echoed in the coverage\nof Fifty Shades of Grey, in which everyone is demanding to know What It All Means\nAbout Women. I've already taken on these questions as they apply to women. But there's\nanother submerged question here -- about men. There's plenty of talk and stereotypes\nabout how men are inherently violent, or more aggressive than women, or \"the dominant\nsex.\"\nAs I said in my previous article: I think it's quite questionable whether women are\n\"inherently submissive,\" but my conclusion is that I don't care. It doesn't actually matter\nto me whether women in general are \"inherently submissive\" (though I really don't think\nwomen are), or whether submissive women's preferences are philosophically Deep And\nMeaningful (though I'm not convinced they are). What matters is:\n1. How women (or any other people) can explore sexually submissive preferences\nconsensually,\n2. How women (or any other people) can compartmentalize submissive preferences so\nthat their whole lives are safe and fulfilling and happy, and\n3. How women (or any other people) can be treated well in arenas that aren't even\nrelevant to their sexuality -- like the workplace.\nThis is also how I feel about these ideas of \"inherent male violence.\" I don't buy that men\nare \"the dominant sex\" or that men are \"inherently violent.\" Based on what I've read, it\nseems quite clear that individuals with higher testosterone levels -- who are, incidentally,\nnot always men -- often experience more aggressive feelings. Yet that's a far cry from\nlarge-scale generalizations, and it's also frequently irrelevant to questions about how\npeople can best deal with those aggressive feelings. Plus, psychological submission can\nbe a very separate thing from physical aggression levels.\nMuch of the time, when it comes to aggression, anger management is the answer, the\nsame way a naturally shy or submissive person needs to learn to set boundaries. But there\nare circumstances where catharsis is completely acceptable. Lots of perfectly decent men\nhave urges towards violent dominance; what do they do about it? How much do they\nagonize, like Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey, and how much do they explore their\ndesires in a consensual and reasonable way?\nI always thought that the late-90s movie Fight Club was fascinating primarily because of\nits lens on masculinity and violence. It's not just about the violence men to do each other,\nbut to themselves. Quotes include \"You have to give up; you have to know that someday\nyou're gonna die,\" and \"The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club.\"\nI first watched it before I knew much about S&M, but now whenever I think about it, I\nthink about how the idea of a fight club -- where people would get together and fight, for\ncatharsis and community -- is so very reminiscent of how a lot of people experience\nS&M. Fight Club even has safewords. Someone says stop, you stop. I obviously don't\nsupport the endpoint of the Fight Club story (i.e., blowing up buildings), but the idea of\nestablishing a men's community via a fight club seems reasonable to me.\nSo, what are the practicalities of dealing with aggressive or dominant tendencies in the\nsexual arena? As an S&M person, I've experimented with dominance as well as\nsubmission, but because violence is so associated with masculinity, I turned to some\negalitarian male S&Mers for advice. I believe that even for non-S&M people, their\nperspectives make a really good lens for ideas of gender and violence and power. Of\ncourse, the first thing one of my friends told me was: \"I'm not sure I really see dominance\nin general as being particularly masculine. I don't really think it's a gender associated\nthing.\"\nThat gentleman, who comments around the Internet under the name Scootah, went on to\nadd: \"I've certainly worried about my kinks in the past. I mean fundamentally, I get\nreally, really turned on by grabbing someone by the hair, throwing them into the wall,\nbackhanding them, etc. That's a pretty disturbing thought for an egalitarian who's worked\nwith abuse victims. I spend a lot of time considering the ethics of my kinks; my partners'\nenthusiastic consent is a major priority.\"\nJay Wiseman, author of the famous S&M primer SM101, talks about his own early fears\ntowards the beginning of that book. He writes about how he began having sadistic\nfantasies, and went to the public library to research them. All he could find was portraits\nof serial killers, which scared the hell out of him. He writes:\nI decided to keep myself under surveillance. I made up my mind that I was not going to\nhurt anybody. If I thought I was turning into someone that would harm somebody else,\nthen I would either put myself in a mental institution or commit suicide. And thus I lived,\nwaiting and watching to see if I was turning into someone that I needed to shoot.\nFortunately, Wiseman found partners who were open to exploring S&M with him, and\nwent on to write extensively about safety and consent and communication within S&M.\nTrying to communicate in an egalitarian way is arguably the most complicated part of\nany S&M encounter; as Scootah told me, \"There are certainly elements that could\npotentially unbalance a relationship in my favor. I'm a big reasonably strong guy. I do\nusually make more money than my partners. I also have this whole sense of position in\nthe local S&M community. I mostly just try to be aware of those things. I try to be very\ncareful about not taking advantage of that and negotiate clearly and not pressure people.\"\nThere are lots of ways to do clear negotiation, including asking open-ended questions\nbefore any S&M actually happens: \"What are you interested in? Could you go into that\nmore?\" There's also a huge emphasis on talking through the S&M encounter afterwards,\nas part of the post-S&M processing we call aftercare. As another gent who goes by Noir\nsaid: \"It really helped me to have a few great, feminist S&M partners. Having that echo\nof 'it's OK, I want this,' as well as the honest feedback when I do wrong really helped\nshape how I experience S&M, and with who. It's meant I learned how better to read and\ngrasp the people in my, er, grasp.\"\nNoir also noted, \"I strive to use dominance and submission as a tool for helping my\npartners become stronger, in ways that also feed my S&M preferences. For example, I\ntend to form long-term interests with women who want a 'safe space' to extend and\nexplore their ability to be sluts, with all that can imply. But in the process, we also\nexplore how becoming more confident in one's sexuality also can reflect into everyday\nlife. Also, just coming to spaces in the S&M community can be a goldmine of\ninformation. All a dominant man has to do is read, listen, open up and understand. One\nthing I learned was that my fears about reinforcing our messed-up society were shared by\nwomen into kink... but also that my ways of approaching the topic, as 'oh, we're so\ncontrolled by society!' were themselves pushing too much agency out of women's\nchoices. There's a balance there that we guys who identify as both feminist and kinky\nhave to respect, and that can come from listening to feminist women struggle with these\nissues, themselves.\"\nThe alternative sexuality advocate Pepper Mint (who has his own blog) told me that in\nterms of putting gender on his experiences, \"I am a bit genderqueer, and I personally\nexperience dominance with either a feminine or masculine vibe from moment to moment.\nCertain activities -- like punching -- feel masculine, while others -- like whipping --\nfeminine in the moment. Also, I switch, meaning that I don't always take the dominant\nrole. Strangely, my most clearly masculine S&M activity is masochism. I always feel\nvery manly while taking pain. I don't think I can clearly explain why these things have\nattached to gender in my head, though presumably I'm being affected by cultural tropes to\nsome extent.\"\nThe consensus in general was that dominance, whether masculine or feminine, is\nsomething that happens in an encounter... not outside it. As Pepper put it, \"New guys\noften want to play hard or do hardcore things, and will often boast and swagger. Kinky\nwomen almost always recognize this as dangerous bullshit. Learn to chill out and not take\nyourself too seriously, and learn to start with a light careful touch when playing with\nsomeone new. Learn to ask for help and guidance, both from others in your S&M\ncommunity and from your partners.\"\nScootah agreed: \"The first mistake I see newbie doms make is trying too hard to be some\nkind of bad ass. Admit your inexperience. Be seen learning. Be modest and have a good\ntime. Learn to communicate well, and to really be friends with your prospective\npartners.\"\nFor me, the bottom line of these conversations is that questioning gender roles, and\nunderstanding gender complications, is an ongoing process. People have a lot of urges\nand preferences that are politically inconvenient and which we will never fully\nunderstand. Whether we're shaped by biology or culture, those feelings will still exist for\nnow, and we have to deal with them. There are ways to do almost anything such that\npeople respect each other, though -- whatever the implications for gender or power.\nViolence is complicated ground, but it can be used in balanced and consensual ways that\nend up bonding people together. Fifty Shades of Grey and Fight Club are both examples,\nand I haven't even touched competitive sports!\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/04/20/50-shades-of-grey-fight-club-and-thecomplications-of-male-dominance/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nABUSE:\n[theory] The Alt Sex Anti-Abuse Dream Team\nI wrote this post in 2010 for the high-profile feminist blog Feministe. If I were to write it\ntoday, then I would write it differently. In particular, if I were writing it today, then I\nwould emphasize that there are actually two primary patterns for abusive S&M\nperpetrators. There are the ones I emphasized in this post, the ones who prey on\ninexperienced people outside the community... but then there's another category:\nperpetrators who achieve high status within the community and then use it to get away\nwith non-consensual things. Other BDSMers have been writing about this more and\nmore, and the discussion is really heating up right now, in 2012. My fellow feminist\nBDSM writer Thomas MacAulay Millar has a particularly long, complex blog series\nabout patterns of abuse in the BDSM community that gives a lot of great reference links\nto other articles on the same topic. I've mentioned Thomas before; I don't always agree\nwith him, but he's principled and passionate and smart. He blogs at the Yes Means Yes\nblog, and the series is being published post-by-post even as I write this. The first post in\nthe series is available at this link:\nhttp://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/23/theres-a-war-on-part-1-troubles-\nbeen-brewing/\n* * *\nThe Alt Sex Anti-Abuse Dream Team\nBDSMers face a lot of stigma around our sexuality, and this can be a major problem\nwhen BDSMers are trying to deal with abusive situations. I've written a lot about\ngenerally negative conceptions of BDSM -- they can briefly be summarized as:\n* S&M is wicked,\n* abnormal,\n* a sign of mental or emotional instability,\n* inherently abusive,\n* or even antifeminist.\nGiven this climate, it's not surprising that two things almost always happen when BDSM\nand abuse come up:\n1) People of all genders who are abused are often unwilling to report. People of all\ngenders who are abused within BDSM relationships tend to be particularly\nunwilling to report. Victim-blaming is already rampant in mainstream society -- just\nimagine what happens to, for example, a woman who has admitted that she enjoys being\nconsensually slapped across the face, if she attempts to report being raped. And that's\nassuming the abuse survivor is willing to report in the first place; ze may prefer not to\nnegotiate the minefield of anti-SM stereotypes ze will be up against, ze may be afraid of\nbeing outed, etc.\n2) Members of the BDSM community sometimes push back against real or perceived\nanti-SM stigma by talking about how abuse is rare within the BDSM community. A\nBDSM blog post and comments over at the awesome blog SM-Feminist claim that not\nonly is abuse within the community rare, but abusive BDSM relationships seem\nmore likely to happen outside the community. In fact, if you look then you can find\nposts from submissive women who found that getting into the BDSM community, being\nexposed to its ideals and concepts, helped them escape or understand their past abusive\nrelationships.\nI tend to think that #2 is a really good point -- particularly the bit about how abusive\nBDSM relationships are more likely to happen outside the community, due in part to lack\nof resources and support for survivors. For this reason, I tend to stress the role of the\ncommunity in positive BDSM experiences, and I encourage newcomers to seek out their\nlocal community. But lots of people don't have access to a local community at all,\nespecially if they're not in a big city. Plus, lots of people have trouble enjoying their local\ncommunity for whatever reason, perhaps because they have nothing in common with\nlocal S&Mers aside from sexuality, or because they don't have time to integrate into a\nwhole new subculture.\nThere's also the unfortunate fact that point #2 sometimes reacts with point #1 in a toxic\nway -- that is, it can ironically be harder for abuse survivors to talk about abuse within the\nBDSM community because the community is pushing back so hard against the stereotype\nof abusive BDSM. I've spoken to BDSMers who feel that the S&M community\npushes back far too hard, and that survivors are being aggressively silenced simply\nbecause the rest of us are so invested in fighting mainstream stereotypes. I have\nnever personally experienced this, but I would not be surprised if I did. And the fact is\nthat I'm sure there are toxic dynamics in some BDSM communities -- we aren't a\nmonolith, folks -- and that even in 100% awesome communities, I'm sure there are at\nleast a few abusive relationships. And even one abusive relationship in the community\nis obviously too many.\nAs Thomas MacAulay Millar wrote when the most recent abusive BDSM case hit the\nmedia, \"Our declaration that the abusers are not us has to be substantive.\" This is\nsomething we should be taking action on. But how?\n* * *\nDynamics Within the Community\nI have personally had excellent experiences within the S&M community. However, I am\nalso pretty thick-skinned (unfortunately, this is partly due to lots of time spent working in\na sexist industry); and I have a well-developed sense of my own boundaries. I am saying\nthis not to sound self-congratulatory but because I believe that, due to being thickskinned,\nI may be less bothered by actual harassment and pressuring dynamics than\nothers are. Also, I am lucky enough that I've never experienced an assault. Therefore, it's\nincumbent upon me to listen to how other S&Mers -- especially female or genderqueer\nS&Mers -- feel about their experiences being pressured within the community.\nThere are issues that even I have noticed. For example, I think that there is a distasteful\ntendency to talk about \"real BDSM\" or \"serious BDSM,\" as if some S&M is more\nlegitimate than other S&M. That's wrong and dangerous because it can make some\npeople feel as though they have to push past their boundaries -- do things they aren't\ncomfortable with -- in order to be accepted, liked, or seen as \"real.\" On the rare occasions\nthat I encounter this, I try to point out the problems right there and then. There is no such\nthing as \"more real\" and \"less real\" S&M. The only truly important part about any\nS&M activity is that it happen among enthusiastic, consenting adults.\nThomas once wrote to me by email that \"I tend to think that the dynamics of abuse in the\ncommunity are a combination of the desire to avoid washing our laundry in public,\npatriarchy colonizing our own, and the usual thing in small communities where people's\nwillingness to do the right thing in theory bumps up against their personal friends and\nloyalties.\" I completely agree. I'd add that similar issues arise in almost all small\ncommunities, and it's not fair to blame S&M in itself for these problems. At the same\ntime, though, it's incumbent upon all BDSMers to contribute to an environment\nwhere people who don't want to participate can easily say \"no\", and can rely on\nbeing supported by others when they do.\n* * *\nExisting Anti-Abuse Initiatives in the BDSM Community\nFinding existing initiatives is a bit of a piecemeal project, but here's what I've run across.\n* A variety of pamphlets and written statements. One example was released by The\nNetwork/La Red, a rather unique anti-abuse organization for lesbians, bi women and\ntrans people. One panel of the pamphlet shows a picture of handcuffs, and the text says:\nThe most basic difference between S/M and abuse is Consent.\nIt is not consent if...\n* You did not expressly give consent.\n* You are afraid to say no.\n* You say yes to avoid conflict.\n* You say yes to avoid consequences (i.e. losing a job, losing your home, being outed).\nS/M is...\n* Always consensual.\n* Done with respect for limits.\n* Enjoyed by all partners.\n* Fun, erotic, and loving.\n* Done with an understanding of trust.\n* Never done with the intent to harm or damage.\nJust because you consent to play does not mean you consent to everything. You have the\nright to set limits.\n(You can look at images of the pamphlet on my Flickr account.)\nSome SM organizations have also released statements on SM and abuse, such as the\nnational Leather Leadership Conference and New York's Lesbian Sex Mafia. Note that at\nthe bottom of the LSM page, they mention that they've sensitized a local abuse hotline; if\nI ever get a grant or something to start a pro-sex anti-abuse center, I'll immediately grill\nthe LSM to see how they got in with that hotline and what they said.\n* Kink Aware counselors. I talk about this all the time, but I think it bears repeating as\noften as possible. The National Coalition for Sexual Freedom maintains an online list of\nKink Aware Professionals, which is a grassroots effort begun by writer/activist Race\nBannon and includes doctors, lawyers, and therapists. The list is pretty much open and\nopt-in -- professionals go to the KAP site and offer to list themselves there -- and this is\none reason it's not a good idea to assume that any given professional will be a great fit for\nyou. Personally, when I was coming into my BDSM identity, I found a Kink Aware\ntherapist to be incredibly helpful -- but while I was finding him, I visited another therapist\nwho was not at all helpful.\nWhen people ask me for kink-friendly survivors' resources, I always tell them to seek a\nKAP therapist first.\n* The annual Alternative Sexualities conference. This is a comparatively new effort\nfrom the Community-Academic Consortium for Research on Alternative Sexualities.\nThey describe it as \"a conference for clinicians and researchers, addressing issues around\nBDSM/Kink sexualities and consensual non-monogamies.\" 2012 will mark the fifth\nConference on Alternative Sexualities. I was on a panel at the 2009 conference in\nChicago, and I thought it was pretty awesome, but I am obviously biased.\n* Community workshops. Most BDSM communities in large cities have educational\nworkshops. These teach SM-related ideas or skills such as community etiquette, how to\nuse various types of equipment, etc. Every SM workshop I have ever attended has\nemphasized careful negotiation and has, at the very least, mentioned safewords. One\nworkshop -- \"The Emotional Aspects of BDSM Play,\" taught by San Francisco's\nEduKink -- gave a detailed list of ideas for how to tell BDSM from abuse, which I wrote\ndown:\n1) Consent. BDSM is consenting; abuse is not.\na) Assuming consent was given -- was it informed consent? Did everyone know what they\nwere consenting to?\nb) Was consent coerced or seduced from the partner? Did everyone feel like they could\nsay no if they wanted? Was anyone worried about suffering negative consequences if they\nsaid no?\n2) Intent. A BDSM partner intends to have a mutually enjoyable encounter; an abusive\npartner does not.\na) Did everyone leave the scene feeling somewhat satisfied?\n3) Damage. A BDSM partner tries to minimize the actual damage inflicted by their\nactions; an abusive partner does not.\na) Did the two partners learn what they were doing before they did it? Did they learn\nhow to perform their activities safely?\nb) Were the partners aware of the potential risks of their activities?\n4) Secrecy. Abuse often happens in secret. This is the hardest one on this checklist,\nbecause -- due to the fact that BDSM is a very marginalized, misunderstood sexuality --\nBDSM often happens in secret, too. But this is one of the benefits of having an entire\nsubculture that deals with BDSM: we try to look out for each other.\na) Were the two partners involved in the local BDSM scene? Did they get advice from\nknowledgeable, understanding BDSM people during rough patches in their relationship?\nI've heard of one or two workshops specifically focused on \"BDSM for Survivors.\" I've\nalso heard of support groups for BDSM-identified survivors of abuse, but I've never run\nacross one in person. I've said this before, but I'll say it again: I believe that the safest\nplace to have a BDSM relationship is within the BDSM community.\n* * *\nMy Fantasy Sex-Positive, Anti-Abuse Program\nYou can tell from the above list that relevant community efforts have focused on raising\ninternal awareness, consolidating useful information, and educating. If I were to get a\ngrant or something (ha!), I would certainly look for ways to use it on a dedicated pro-sex,\nanti-abuse initiative, hopefully more expansive than a hotline, and considerably more\nextensive than a pamphlet. I've never developed this thought too extensively -- I hate to\ntorture myself when I know there's no money for one of my ideas -- but I know I'd want\nmy Dream Anti-Abuse Team to have the following qualities:\n* BDSM is obviously my main interest, because that's how I identify the core of my\nsexuality. But I have a strong interest in destigmatizing all forms of sexual expression\npracticed by consenting adults. Everyone involved in my initiative would emphasize that\npeople of all genders and sexualities could come for help -- whether straight, gay,\nlesbian, bi, trans, asexual, BDSM, sex worker, polyamorous, swing, or whatever\namazing fetish could conceivably come up.\nIdeally, I would personally try to shock the hell out of anyone before I agreed to work\nwith them... because anyone whose face twists up or who gasps at the idea of any kind of\nconsensual weird sex is a person who shouldn't be anywhere near altsexual abuse\nsurvivors.\n* I'd want destigmatizing alternative sexuality among the mainstream, especially\nmainstream anti-abuse organizations, to be a major focus -- so that abuse survivors\ncould feel less anxious about being misunderstood while seeking help. So I'd need people\nwho were willing to go out and charismatically shock the abuse officers at police stations,\nfeminist organizations, college campuses, etc. I'd want us to be running everything from\nanti-stigma poster campaigns to sex communication workshops.\n* I'd want the program to be well-advertised to the general public, so that people who\naren't in the community -- yet who are practicing S&M or poly or whatever on their\nown -- could still find us.\n* Of course we'd also do the more traditional work of offering walk-in counseling to\nabuse survivors, including help making a concrete plan, altsexual-friendly legal advice,\nand so on.\nSo.\nAnyone willing to fund my Dream Team?\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/01/16/the-alt-sex-anti-abuse-dream-team/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nSection 1 Study Guide\nA regular reader who goes by SnowdropExplodes suggested that I add \"study guides\" to\nthe end of each section of this book in order to pull it together, and I thought it was a\ngood idea. (See why I love my readers?) I'm sure that others could find this insufferably\npatronizing, however; if you're one of them, feel free not to read the guides! I'm just\ntrying to offer questions for further thought, and give some insight on why I organized\nthis book the way I did. This section was intended to pull together the ideas I see as\n\"basic\" or \"building blocks\" for feminist sex, both in theory and in practice.\n* * *\n1. Have any of these pieces felt relevant to how you communicate with your partners?\nHave any pieces felt irrelevant or incomprehensible? Can you see any overarching\nthemes that guide which ones felt relevant, and which ones felt incomprehensible?\n1a. If you could give your partners one piece of advice about communicating with you,\nwhat would it be?\n1b. Are there areas of communication that you feel you need to work on? (For example,\nClarisse often thinks that she should work on her non-verbal communication, and has\noccasionally had trouble being direct with her partners about what she wants.)\n1c. What ideas about sex and communication do you think you've absorbed from friends,\nparents, and your larger cultural environment?\n* * *\n2. What stereotypes do you see acting on your sexuality?\n2a. Have you come up with any mental tactics for thinking around those stereotypes?\nWhat are they? (For example, Clarisse sees the \"S&M superpowers\" concept as a positive\nway of framing S&M, so it doesn't feel \"broken\" or \"dark.\")\n* * *\n3. Are there any areas of your sexuality where you feel trapped or stalled? Can you think\nof ways that you want to move forward on those, or do you think it might be a good idea\nto take some time off from those activities instead?\n* * *\n4. If you were feeling anxious about a relationship or uncertain about your boundaries,\nwho would you turn to in order to talk about that? Do you have friends (online or offline)\nor other resources where you could find advice?\n4a. Are there unique problems affecting abusive relationships within the communities\nyou frequent? How do sexual stereotypes affect how you and your friends perceive both\npositive relationships and abusive relationships?\n* * *\n5. What are the overarching patterns that you see within the pieces in this section? How\nare these disparate topics relevant to each other?\n5a. Is consent complicated?\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nSECTION 2:\nActivism and Allies\nIn which we explore activism and other topics tangentially related to S&M feminism --\nfrom sex work, to polyamory and monogamy, to the nature of masculinity.\n* * *\nWhen I think of this section, I think of:\nAbuse of power comes as no surprise.\n~ Jenny Holzer\nI think of Clarisse as the John Stuart Mills of sexuality.\n~ one of my ex-boyfriends\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nACTIVISM:\n[theory] Grassroots Organizing For Feminism, S&M, HIV, and\nEverything Else\nI wrote this in March 2011 for Bitch Magazine's Feminist Coming-Out Day Blog\nCarnival. The goal was to talk about feminist \"click\" moments, and my entry was\npredictably wide-ranging and idiosyncratic.\n* * *\nGrassroots Organizing For Feminism, S&M, HIV, and Everything Else\nEarlier this month, my sex-positive documentary film series screened Jane: An Abortion\nService. The film tells the extraordinary story of \"Jane,\" an underground network of\nwomen in Chicago who provided thousands of safe abortions in the years before abortion\nwas legal. It was totally inspiring.\nJane was started accidentally by a woman named Heather Booth. Booth was a student at\nthe University of Chicago in the late 1960s when another woman came and asked her --\nsecretly, of course -- whether she knew any abortion doctors. Heather Booth found one,\nand she also found that other women started coming to her for references.\nAs one woman in the film put it, in those days, women who sought abortions were all\n\"hysterical and desperate and scared\": if you needed an abortion, you knew you would\nhave to come up with some fabulous amount of money and take a life-threatening risk.\nSome women committed suicide when they got pregnant instead. Information about\nabortion was at a premium.\nSo Heather Booth began looking for abortion doctors, and better than that, she started\nvetting them. After finding the doctors, she sought testimonials about those doctors.\nCommon problems with abortion doctors ranged from being rude to actually assaulting\ntheir patients; some doctors, who already charged sky-high prices, would demand more\nmoney at the last minute. Booth kept a list of abortion doctors who didn't do those things.\nPretty soon, there were other women who had her list too, and they were vetting doctors\nand spreading the word as well. The group also provided counseling before and after the\nprocedure, letting the patients know what they could expect -- physically and\nemotionally. They called themselves \"Jane\": a woman who called them and asked for\n\"Jane\" was seeking an abortion.\nAfter some time, the women of Jane figured out that abortion isn't a complex procedure,\nand they convinced a doctor to teach them how to do it safely. And then they taught each\nother. So then they didn't have to refer patients to doctors: they did all the abortions\nthemselves, and they did them for whatever the patient could spare rather than charging\nprices that were out of reach for many women. Jane members continued to provide\nemotional support, as well: in the documentary, one member reminisces about how she\nwould have patients over to dinner with her kids and talk to them for a while before\nperforming the procedure. It got to the point where doctors and medical students sent\nwomen to Jane, rather than getting referrals from Jane.\nThat is positive activism. That is building the world we want to see.\nWhen abortion was legalized in 1973, the group quietly disbanded. Some members of\nJane went on to be involved in other parts of the feminist movement or to found respected\nwomen's health organizations.\nIt's not that Jane had no problems; the organization was not transparent, for example, and\nit sounds like there was a fair amount of gossip and internal difficulties. These are typical\nissues within small groups, and the stigma and anxiety of what they were doing can't\npossibly have helped, but still, it's important to work against those problematic patterns\nfrom the beginning. It's worth it, I think; I'm increasingly convinced that the most\npositive direct change can be traced to small, grassroots, community groups. Which\nmeans that making sure your small, grassroots community group is egalitarian but wellorganized\ncan have ripple effects all down the line.\nAnother example of such a group might be Chicago's Rape Victim Advocates. RVA was\nestablished in 1974 by doctors and nurses who were appalled by how badly rape\nsurvivors were treated in the emergency room. Back then, there was no public\nunderstanding of how traumatic rape could be, and little understanding of survivors'\nexperience, even from police and doctors. (An older female friend of mine who was\nraped in 1970 once told me that she tried to talk to a psychiatrist about what happened.\nHe sighed and said, \"Really, do you think that's important?\") Rape Victim Advocates has\nalways been a network of volunteers who are on-call to come and talk to rape survivors,\nbut since 1974, it has also developed from a fragile activist group into one with funding\nand political presence.\nAnd on a somewhat different note, S&M community organizing is really quite good. A\nlot of people don't realize that most S&M community dungeons (unlike the professional\ndungeons run by sex workers) are nonprofit organizations, kind of like community\ncenters. (No, seriously.) People don't just go to community dungeons to do S&M -- they\nalso go to community dungeons for discussion groups or educational workshops, to learn\nhow to perform certain activities safely.\nMuch like Jane, the S&M community has also created a network of necessary references:\nthe Kink Aware Professionals list. If you've read my work before, you've probably read\nabout this list, because it had a huge impact on my life and I like to spread the word.\nS&M activists in San Francisco realized, years ago, that there was a need for lawyers and\ndoctors who understood their lives and wouldn't stigmatize their choices, so they wrote\nthree names on a piece of paper and passed it around. Now, the Kink Aware\nProfessionals list is an international online directory hosted by the nonprofit National\nCoalition for Sexual Freedom.\nAgain, it's not like there are no problems in the S&M community; people gossip, people\nbackstab, people fuck up. There's little vetting process for educators or for people who\nlist themselves on Kink Aware Professionals, and a lot of people run kink classes at least\nas much from a desire for status as from a desire to educate. But still, I think the S&M\ncommunity is engaging in positive activism... more than a lot of us even realize.\nThis was a lesson that really hit home for me when I spent a year in Africa working on\nHIV mitigation. One of the reasons international aid is so complicated is that figuring out\nhow to help a community that's not yours is incredibly hard. A lot of well-meaning\nAmericans (including myself) go abroad with little understanding of how hard it is. The\nreality is that assisting with, for example, public health in a foreign place entails learning\nthe social fabric of that country in a way that outsiders can only do with tons of sustained\neffort... and we're still unlikely to be as good as someone who grew up there. One of the\nreasons -- maybe the biggest reason -- I left was that it was so obvious to me that I was a\nbetter activist in the USA... even when I wasn't trying to do activism. (When I was there,\nI received one letter from an American girl asking for advice on how to do African\nactivism. My advice to her can be summarized as, \"It's harder than you think, and you\nmight consider staying home where you're awesomer.\")\nWhen HIV began destroying the gay community, the most effective and important\nmeasures to curb it came from people like Richard Berkowitz, the actual gay activist who\nwrote a safer sex pamphlet on his home typewriter and then distributed it by hand. They\nsaw a need and they did something about it. Just like Jane. Just like S&M educators.\nYou are probably already part of more communities than you might realize. If you go to a\nuniversity, you're part of that community. Whether you live in a city neighborhood or a\nsmall town, you're part of that community. If you go to particular clubs, you're in those\ncommunities. There may be aspects of your identity that could align with a community as\nwell: for example, if you read science fiction there are conventions for that (although of\ncourse, identity communities don't always work for everyone with that identity). These\nare places where your knowledge already makes you powerful... so keep an eye out for\nneeds. (It's also worth considering getting involved in an intentional community. I'm kind\nof psycho about housing co-ops, for example, because they are awesome. I personally am\na member of North American Students of Cooperation, but there are other groups, and\nthere are also independent co-ops that aren't part of larger networks.)\nWe live in an unstable and fast-paced age. I don't know how people in most other\ncountries feel, but I know that here in the USA, there is a quite pervasive and quite\njustified anxiety among everyone I know in the middle class. Many of our safety nets are\nevaporating, and it's not at all clear that they will be replaced. But no matter how much\nthe people in power fuck us over, we'll never be totally screwed as long as we're not\nisolated and we talk to each other.\nOne of the former members of Jane, a white-haired feminist with such powerful energy\nthat she practically glows through the screen, says in the documentary: \"Don't stay with\npeople who tell you you're crazy and useless. Don't stay where you're weak.\" That's what\nI call an activist click moment: find the other people like you, and organize with them.\nThat applies to feminism, it applies to sexuality, it applies to public health. Go where\nyou're strong and make your people stronger.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/03/29/grassroots-organizing-for-feminism-sm-hivand-everything-else/\nThe film Jane: An Abortion Service is available from the distributor Women Make\nMovies:\nhttp://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c410.shtml\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nACTIVISM:\n[storytime] Interview with Richard Berkowitz, Star of Sex Positive and\nIcon of Safer Sex Activism\nRichard Berkowitz is an interesting guy. He was active in the gay community in the\n1970s and 80s as an S&M sex worker, so he's got plenty of experience with all kinds of\nsexual history. Not only that, but he also wrote the very first safer sex pamphlet ever,\nwhen HIV began storming through the gay community. The pamphlet was called \"How to\nHave Sex in an Epidemic\"; Berkowitz literally wrote it at home on his typewriter and\nthen distributed copies by hand. Then he was slammed by his own community for doing\nso... well, read on and learn more about what happened next.\nI was honored to interview Berkowitz in early 2009. I really love it when I get the chance\nto talk to boundary-breaking activists who were around before I was born, especially if\ntheir domain is sexuality. I feel a combination of both exhilaration and despair during\nthese discussions -- exhilaration because I learn how far we've come, and despair\nbecause I can see how we keep making the same mistakes again and again and again.\n* * *\nInterview with Richard Berkowitz, Star of Sex Positive and Icon of Safer Sex\nActivism\nOur second film at my awesome sex-positive film series was Sex Positive, a fascinating\ndocumentary about the history of safer sex. I'll be honest: I was psyched about Sex\nPositive from day one, long before I'd even seen it. It was the first film I chose for my\nfilm list. In fact, the whole idea for the film series came out of a conversation I had with\nLisa (our lovely Hull-House Museum education coordinator) in which I said that I\nwanted to see Sex Positive, and then added, \"There are so many sexuality movies I want\nto see. You and I should have a regular movie night!\" She looked at me and said\nthoughtfully, \"You know, I bet people besides us would come to that....\"\nSex Positive tells the story of Richard Berkowitz -- and how he was one of the first to\nspread the word about safer sex in America. Berkowitz, a talented writer, started out as a\nhot-blooded participant in the promiscuous gay bathhouse culture; later, he became an\nS&M hustler (i.e., a sex worker). When AIDS started decimating the gay community,\nBerkowitz was instrumental in teaching his community (and the world) about safer sex.\nAs it became clear to some medical professionals that sexual promiscuity spread AIDS,\nBerkowitz tried to tell the world about their findings. But there was a huge backlash\nagainst him -- because in those days, the promiscuous bathhouse culture was seen by\nmany gay men as a huge part of identifying as gay and sex-positive... and anyone who\nargued against it, or tried to modify it, was therefore cast by many people as sex-negative.\nAfter we screened Sex Positive, I reviewed it on my blog, and Richard Berkowitz himself\nread the review! He left a comment offering feedback, and I was so thrilled and honored\nto hear from him that I emailed him right away. We talked a little bit, and met in person\nlast time I was in New York City -- and I practically begged him to let me interview him\nby email. Here's the results: a discussion of Richard's history with S&M; what he thinks\nabout advocacy; his feelings about the gay community and its history; and where he finds\nhimself in his life right now.\nClarisse Thorn: In Sex Positive, you mention that you didn't initially think of\nyourself as a BDSM type, but that you had partners who convinced you to do it. Do\nyou think you would have gotten into BDSM if you hadn't had partners pressuring\nyou to do it? Do you think you would have gotten into it if you hadn't been able to\nmake money at it?\nRichard Berkowitz: I was filmed talking in three- to four-hour sessions over the course of\na year about difficult, often painful, personal history. At times I felt uncomfortable, I\nmade mistakes, so there are moments in Sex Positive that I wish I could clarify -- but it's\nnot my film. That's why I'm thrilled that you're giving me the first opportunity to address\nthe moments that make me cringe when I see the movie -- and what amazed me is that\nyou nailed most of them.\nMe -- pressured into S&M? Hell, no. I stumbled across BDSM porn in college, and was\nboth appalled and more turned on than I was to any other porn. I pursued a few\nexperiences as a novice when I was in college, and I was completely turned off to the\nscene for years. The few Tops I met were clumsy, distracted by fetishes that bored me,\nand I was convinced a bottom could easily get hurt -- so I walked away.\nWhen I began hustling in NYC, I was an angry activist and it attracted S&M bottoms that\nwere happy to teach me what I could do with my anger that was erotic and consensual.\nTo that I added what I had learned that Tops did wrong -- and presto! I got really good at\nit fast -- and I loved it. I was doing two or three scenes a day, but because I could often\nsteer a scene to what turned me on, it felt more like play than work.\nIf I hadn't had been trained as a Top by older, experienced bottoms who were hiring me, I\nstill would have had S&M experiences on my own. But I doubt that I would have gotten\nas heavily into the scene if it wasn't for hustling. That's where I earned my S&M PhD.\nIn 1979, S&M was considered the fallback scene for aging hustlers -- it was what you\nturned to when you were losing your youth. There was such a dearth of good Tops. But I\nhad the raw material to be a great Top at 23, and I built quite a reputation on word-ofmouth\nreferrals and repeats. Many of my clients became close friends.\nCT: Where do you place BDSM in your sexual identity and self-conception? Do you\nsee it as deeply part of you, or something you chose? Do you think of your BDSM\nurges as coming from a place as deep, as intrinsic, as your gay orientation?\nRB: I think it's too late for me to answer that question. Turning my libido into an\noccupation at 23 changed me in both good ways and bad. It would take a book to explain\n-- so let me just say that as a product of gay male sex in the 70s, there was an element of\npower intrinsic to the sexuality of the times. That shaped me. I don't see vanilla sex and\nS&M sex as mutually exclusive because I believe in Tops and bottoms -- and that's the\nbasis of BDSM. \"Tops and bottoms\" are not exclusive to BDSM; the terms are widely\nused for assigning roles of power in sex in general. Gore Vidal said, \"There is no such\nthing as gay and straight -- only top and bottom.\" I believe both are true.\nBut one shouldn't lose sight of the fact that a third of my living space for the past three\ndecades was a sound-proofed dungeon.\nI think that a culture like ours that's based on competition, as opposed to cooperation, can\nbe extremely sadomasochistic. I think bad S&M can be found in many aspects of our\ndaily life, and good S&M is just eroticizing aspects of being human that can enhance sex\nimmensely for some.\nCT: What kind of BDSM advocacy have you encountered? What kind of sex work\nadvocacy have you encountered? What did you think of what you saw? Do you have\nany ideas about how to make those movements effective? Do you have any fears\nabout those movements? Would you consider being part of those movements?\nRB: My only fear about those movements would be if they didn't exist! My neighbor\ndown the hall for the past 25 years built my dungeon and was a co-founder of Gay Male\nSM Activists, but I always had too much hot sex going on at home to be interested in\nmeetings. Plus, I never stopped feeling like a pariah in the gay community because of the\nattacks on me and my writing since AIDS began. You reach a point where you just\nassume people hate you because it's easier than trying to figure out who doesn't.\nI fiercely support BDSM advocacy, but mainly from a distance. There's a limited number\nof body blows any activist can take before we just retreat. I had my fill -- but the response\nto Sex Positive and the new Obama era is nudging me out of my shell. I had a breakup a\nfew years ago that devastated me, so I've been out of the scene for almost three years.\nNow I'm trying to reinvent myself, find one person I can retreat from the world with. I've\nnever lied about S&M being an intrinsic part of my sexuality, and because of my early\nbad experiences with BDSM, I'm thrilled and inspired by advocates for it. If there had\nbeen BDSM advocacy when I came into BDSM, then I don't think I would have had the\nbad experiences I mentioned earlier. As a BDSM sex worker, I met so many men who\nhad horrible tales of being hurt in scenes, and I did my best to be an antidote for that.\nCT: On my blog, you commented that \"Of course BDSM was a source of joy in my\nlife but I put it aside when it robs me from having a platform to champion safe sex\nto the largest possible audience, which BDSM often has.\" Could you talk more\nabout that?\nRB: Smear campaigns are hard to pin down, and there's no way to know how much of the\ncontempt against me or my writing was due to my BDSM, my sex work, my safe sex\nevangelism or simply me. I'm just a dangling pinata for people who have issues with sex!\nThere are gay people of my generation who are as uninformed and rabidly anti-BDSM\nsex as homophobes are about gay sex.\nI can't think of anyone who has gone on film with such brutally honest testimony about\ntheir radical sexual history as I did in Sex Positive. It felt like a huge risk and you can see\nmy anxiety in the film, but to me, this level of honesty is crucial to pro-sex activism.\nPeople are so dishonest about sex; many would never talk publicly about their private\nsexual behavior -- and they don't want others doing it either, so it's not easy.\nThere was a doctor I saw once when AIDS began who heard I was into S&M. As he went\nto take blood from me, he stabbed the needle into my arm. I bolted out of the chair\nscreaming, and he said coyly, \"Oh, sorry, I thought you liked pain.\" How can I not feel\nreticent talking about BDSM considering so many people I've met like that? And then I\nthink, how can I not?\nI've seen the most courageous pro-sex writers and activists attacked, pilloried and\nsilenced because of their honesty in writing about their kinky sexual histories. I shudder\nwhen I recall the vicious smears against pro-sex feminists by anti-porn feminists back in\nthe early 80s. I don't want to invite that bile into my life, especially now, when my circle\nof gay male friends are no longer alive and here to support me when I go out on a limb\nwith my personal radical sexual issues in public.\nSo why did I speak out? Why do I still speak out? Because I owed so much to the army of\nmen who loved and supported me over the years and no longer have a voice, and because\ngay men were dying. It was no time to be squeamish about sex. It still isn't.\nCT: Do you have any regrets? -- and, concurrently, what are you most proud of?\nDid the making of the film Sex Positive bring any regret or pride to the surface for\nyou?\nRB: I have a few regrets about Sex Positive, but they pale next to what I've gained. I've\nbeen to more cities with this movie in one year than I've been to in my entire life. Young\npeople have been extraordinarily supportive and kind, and it helps me to let go of the\npast. I've been stuck in the past for so long -- it's deadening, but I finally feel that this\nmovie is breaking me free, to finally let go and move on to write about other things. For\nthat, I'm forever indebted to Daryl Wein, the documentary's director.\nWhat I'm most proud of is how much work I did on safe sex that no one even knows\nabout. I'm putting it all on the Internet as a free archive, as soon as I can find or pay\nsomeone to help me with the technical stuff. I'm from the age of typewriters.\nCT: Is there anything you'd like to add? Please feel free to also respond directly to\npoints I made when I talked about Sex Positive on my blog.\nRB: I loved S&M hustling before AIDS so much -- sometimes, when I talk about it, I\nbecome the part of me that tied people up and dominated them; it's like a mental erection.\nI get lost in the reverie of being an erotic, arrogant Top. I begged director Daryl Wein to\ndelete me saying that clients would tell me that I could do whatever I wanted to them\nexcept fuck them, and then I would proceed to do just that. I said that when I was lost in a\npersona, and it makes me sound like a rapist!\nThe truth is, my most valued expertise as a hustler was teaching men who were afraid of\ngetting fucked how to relax, how to douche, how to open up, how to explore the intense\npleasures of receptive anal intercourse and anal orgasm without any pain. I would never\nrape or violate anyone's consent -- and certainly not customers I wanted to come back! I\nhad tremendous empathy for how difficult it can be to learn how to get anally fucked\nbecause I was never able -- or had the desire -- to do it without being high on drugs. (You\nhave to remember how pervasive recreational drug use was during the sexual revolution.\nThere were articles in the gay press saying how cocaine was good for you. We didn't\nunderstand addiction then as we do now. And we paid a heavy price for that innocence\nand ignorance.)\nWhen I began hustling in NYC, the lesbian and gay liberation movement was ten years\nold -- and about that mature. We grew up in such an intensely erotophobic and\nhomophobic culture -- there was no way to escape it, even after we accepted that we were\ngay. We didn't always treat each other well, and it permeated our sexual expression\nwhether it was vanilla or S&M.\nYou mention in your blog post that you are wary of how I talk about BDSM as arising\nfrom \"self-loathing\" and \"insecurity\" and negative cultural pressures on the gay\ncommunity. Yes -- in S&M and in vanilla sex -- I saw how we brought a lot of the\nculture's contempt to what we did. But, as I say in Sex Positive, many of us came to\nrealize this, and we understood that a lot of sexual fantasies are socially constructed by\nthe times that shaped us. Many of us came to realize that sexual fantasies don't diminish\nus as people -- they can actually help free and enrich us when we understand what we're\ndoing.\nI'm reluctant to put myself forward as a role model for BDSM and sex work, because of\nwhat happened to me after AIDS when I went back to hustling. I was furious that there\nwas no place in the community for me to do safe sex education. I felt so hurt that some\npeople only saw me as a sex worker/sadomasochist and that political differences got in\nthe way of saving sexually active gay men's lives. You can't imagine the rage I felt that it\ntook two entire years after we wrote and published \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\"\nfor NYC to do its first safe sex campaign. I went back to hustling in such despair that I\nwas an addiction waiting to happen, and that's what did.\nIn the end, though, BDSM and my love for it is part of what saved my life. If I weren't so\nbusy hustling with BDSM before AIDS and safe sex, I would have spent much more time\nat the baths having high risk sex, and died long ago. I think each of us has a limit to how\nmuch sex and how many different partners our spirits can bear. Sex can become an\naddiction, and when you reach that point, people use recreational drugs to keep that level\nof hypersexual activity going. If I had found a place in safe sex education, my life would\nhave been a much happier, healthier journey. But I never lose sight of how grateful I am\nto still be here, or how much joy and pleasure sexual freedom gave me until the world I\nloved started collapsing all around me and taking the men I loved along with it.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2009/03/23/interview-with-richard-berkowitz-star-of-sexpositive-and-icon-of-safer-sex-activism/\nCheck out Richard Berkowitz's web site to read more about him and investigate his book\n(which I admit I have not read), Stayin' Alive: The Invention of Safe Sex:\nhttp://richardberkowitz.com/\nAnd seriously, if you get the chance, watch Daryl Wein's awesome documentary Sex\nPositive:\nhttp://www.sexpositive-themovie.com/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nABUSE:\n[theory] Social Responsibility Within Activism\nI wrote this post in 2010 for Thanksgiving (the original post had a bunch of \"thank yous\"\nat the end, which I removed from this version). The questions here seem to be some of the\nbiggest recurring questions in my life. Later events have taught me a lot about work that\nhas already been done on accountability within communities. In particular, I want to\nhighlight the book The Revolution Starts At Home: Confronting Intimate Violence\nWithin Activist Communities (edited by Ching-In Chen, Jai Dulani, and Leah Lakshmi\nPiepzna-Samarasinha), which was published in 2011.\nBut there's a lot of other work out there on how to deal with a perpetrator of violence\nwithout resorting to our corrupt and violent established prison system. People of color\nshould be credited for much of this work, because communities of color are rarely wellserved\nby the criminal justice system, and thus have particular incentives to seek\nalternatives. Sometimes, this field is called \"transformative justice\" or \"restorative\njustice.\" Here is a post that links to a number of resources on transformative justice:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/01/30/some-transformative-justice-links/\n* * *\nSocial Responsibility Within Activism\nTonight I had Thanksgiving dinner with my mother and her boyfriend. Some friends of\nmy mother attended, one of whom is a lesbian who I'll call Kay. Kay attended dinner\nwith her mother, who is unaware of Kay's sexual orientation. One of the reasons Kay's\nmom doesn't know about Kay's sexual orientation is that Kay's mom has already behaved\nquite badly towards Kay's elder sister, who is an out-of-the-closet lesbian.\nI knew this whole situation going in, and one thing that struck me was how much of a\nnice person Kay's mom is. I mean... she's really nice. I mean, she clearly tries to be a\ngood person. She also tried really hard to help me do the dishes. (I didn't let her because I\nwanted them all to myself.)\nI've been thinking a lot lately about how to engage with people who have done bad\nthings, or who are currently doing things I think are bad (like shaming their lesbian\ndaughters). It wouldn't have been right to throw my sex-positive ideas on the table while\ntalking to Kay's mom -- mostly because Kay specifically asked me not to, ahead of time.\nBut. The most powerful tool for getting people to reconsider their stigma against\nalternative sexuality is personal engagement. Don't I have some responsibility here? Is\nthere something I can do?\nOther examples of this are rife. One very intense, very important issue I grappled with\nthis week was having a friend email me to inform me that another friend -- someone I\nlike and admire a lot -- has been credibly accused of sexual assault by a person who will\nnever press charges. This has come up before in my life... every time it's a little different,\nand yet so many things are the same: a person is assaulted, the news gets out among\nfriends, the survivor doesn't press charges, there is confusion among the friends about\nhow to act, eventually things die down, and I feel as though I should have done more.\nWhen I was in high school, one of my closest male friends raped a female acquaintance\nof mine. She didn't press charges and they later had a romance that was, to all\nappearances, consensual. I pieced events together slowly -- he did acknowledge what he'd\ndone, though never directly to me. I didn't know what to do, at the time, and I still feel as\nthough I should have done so much more. He and I were so close. I never had the nerve\nto directly talk to him about what happened, because -- even though we never talked\ndirectly about it -- I saw evidence that he felt terrible about it, and I was sure that I could\ndevastate him by talking about it more. But still... I should have talked to him.\nI also feel as though I should have supported her more, but I don't know what I could\nhave said. There were people who told her that she shouldn't be having a consensual\nrelationship with her rapist. It seemed wrong to tell her that -- I felt like it eroded her\nagency, attacked her right to choose -- so I didn't say it. If I had said it, though, would\nthat have been helpful to her? What could I have done to be a better resource for her?\nEspecially given that I was such close friends with him?\nI was young(er), but that's no excuse. Then again, what am I excusing? I did nothing. But\nI should have done more.\nNow, again, I have a friend, a good friend, who assaulted someone. It's a friend in the\nlocal S&M community. I don't know the survivor at all. I have to talk to my friend about\nit, but what do I say, and what happens next? Feminism instructs us that we should listen\nto the voices of survivors, that community mores and community condemnation are what\nstops rape from happening. I believe these things to be true; and there are people close to\nme who have survived rape, and I really want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to\nensure that rape stops happening. But I intensely wish that I had more guidance on what\nexactly to say, how exactly to act, to change the mores.\nI emailed my ex-boyfriend Mr. Chastity for advice, because he's got one of the finest\nethical minds I've ever been lucky enough to engage with. Here's part of what he wrote\nback:\nI've tried to distill your messages into a few questions, and I ended up with \"How does\none parse a situation in which a friend, and an otherwise noble person, seems to have\ndone serious wrong?\" and \"What are a person's moral obligations in this case?\"\nNobody is composed of unmixed goodness or evil, no matter how much of a\nparagon/fiend 1) they seem to be or 2) their principles require. People we respect and\nlove are not forces of nature or avatars of their cause of choice, no matter how\nthoroughly they embody it to us. I don't say this because I think you haven't considered it,\nbut because I know I've had a lot of trouble absorbing it over the years and think it might\ntherefore bear restating to others, too.\nAs an individual, a person has a relatively large degree of freedom in action and\nassociation. I think where this case becomes truly difficult to consider is when we bring\nin justice and the community. Because the means of enforcement of the rules of these\ncommunities is so interpersonal, one's interpersonal actions take on an unusual role of\ncommunity-level justice as well as merely justice between two people. I can't see how it\ncould ever be good to allow things like this to just slide. Honestly, I'm not sure what else\nyou can do but (as you suggest in one of your messages) politely ask your friend about\ntheir take on the story. If nothing else, it will demonstrate that people are paying\nattention to this thing and might give you some insight into their character and opinions\nof the issue.\nHe's right. I agree. But. What now? How do I ask, what do I say? How can I tell if my\nfriend has dealt with whatever healing has to take place in order for such assaults not to\nhappen again?\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/11/26/social-responsibility-activism-and-givingthanks/\nIt is really worth reading about work that's already been done on transformative justice:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/01/30/some-transformative-justice-links/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nBOUNDARIES:\n[storytime] Taking Care Of Each Other\nThis was originally published in 2012 at the girl-power site OffOurChests.com.\n* * *\nTaking Care Of Each Other\nAs a sex educator, I think a lot about how to teach boundaries. I try to come up with\nexercises, stories, maxims that could help people respect their own bodies, minds, and\ndesires; and of course I also think about how to encourage people to respect others'\nboundaries. But the biggest influences on a person's boundaries have nothing to do with\nwhat I teach. Good boundaries are (hopefully) demonstrated by parents, influenced by\nfriends, and encouraged by partners.\nWithin a community, though, I also think it's really important not to tell people what to\ndo. I believe that it's crucial to be a good resource for the people close to us, without\ntrying to force them to do what we think is best. That way, we can both build trust and\nfoster independence. On the other hand, sometimes it's hard to know how to do that when\nI know more about a certain subject than someone else. It is so powerfully tempting to\ntell them what I think they should do!\nI was thinking about this recently when, out of the blue, I remembered something that\nhappened when I was 16 or 17. I'd just had a nasty breakup, I was really unhappy about\nmy ex, and I was trying marijuana. I had never smoked before.\nThere were a bunch of other people my age present -- including a guy who'd been flirting\nwith me for a while. When he passed me the marijuana, he kissed me. I kissed back. I\nwasn't attracted to him, but I felt so empty and hurt, and I guess it was reassuring that\nsomeone wanted me, despite the fact that my ex-boyfriend didn't.\nAlso around was a girl who I'll call Lena. I had always seen Lena as tough and no-\nnonsense, but I didn't know much else about her. I think she probably considered me a bit\nnaive. Anyway, Lena watched the situation and my body language; she knew that it was\nmy first time smoking. A few minutes later, she took me aside. I don't remember the\nexact conversation, but I seem to recall that it went something like this:\n\"Clarisse,\" Lena said, \"how are you feeling?\"\n\"I'm not sure,\" I said. Truth be told, I felt a bit numb.\nLena looked directly into my face. \"How far do you want to go tonight?\" she asked.\nI looked away. I felt embarrassed because she seemed so composed. I felt like an airhead\ncompared to her. We were standing next to a wooden wall, and I pretended to study the\nwood-grain. \"I don't know,\" I said vaguely.\n\"If you can tell me how far you want to go tonight,\" Lena said firmly, \"then I'll make sure\nnothing goes past that. Do you want to keep making out? Do you want to do more than\nmake out?\"\nI traced a knot in the wood with my finger. \"Making out,\" I decided.\n\"Okay,\" Lena said, and nodded. I don't remember if she said anything else, but as she\ntook me back to the group I still felt a little embarrassed -- and also incredibly relieved.\nI wonder if I ever thanked Lena? I should have; maybe I'll try to find her on Facebook or\nsomething. Because I really did feel a lot safer that night, knowing that Lena was looking\nout for me. I made out with that gentleman a little bit more, but after a while I put a stop\nto it, and nothing else happened.\nMaybe if Lena hadn't been there, I still would have had the wherewithal to stop making\nout with him; or maybe I would have felt so confused, anxious, numb that I let it go\nfurther. (And I can tell you for sure that I'm glad it didn't go further.) Or, God forbid,\nmaybe if she hadn't been there then I would have been actively pressured into something\nthat I actively objected to.\nBefore that, it had never occurred to me to set a clear boundary before I hooked up with a\nguy. That's an important lesson in itself! Even more importantly, though, Lena didn't tell\nme what to do. She didn't say anything about how I should be sexual, or who I should do\nit with. She didn't shame me for what was up. She just asked me what I wanted, and then\nshe offered me her support.\nCertainly, Lena is just one small piece in the puzzle of my life. But I still remember her,\nand I admire and thank her. My parents have offered me a lot of support throughout my\nlife, both in my relationships and otherwise. I've had partners who helped show me what\nit means to create a low-pressure sexual environment, or who helped me learn clear\nsexual communication. Still, Lena stands out in my mind -- someone I barely knew, yet\nsomeone who helped show me what it means to be among women who stand up for each\nother and help preserve each other's boundaries.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://offourchests.com/taking-care-of-each-other/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nMANLINESS:\n[theory] Questions I Want To Ask Entitled Cis Het Men\nI wrote this piece in 2009. It was the culmination of years I'd spent thinking about\nmasculinity, manliness, and men's gender role. I was relatively new to blogging, and I\nhadn't yet established myself. I thought that the most controversial things I would ever\nwrite would be about S&M. I was wrong.\nI published this in three parts, and it got a huge response. The major feminist blog Alas!\nA Blog asked to repost it, for example, but there was a much bigger reaction among nonfeminist\nand anti-feminist men. Some wrote responses with titles like \"Answers for an\nEntitled Feminist.\" Others actually came over to my blog and engaged me, with varying\nresults. It kicked off a long, dense discussion in my blog Comments section, which lasted\nfor over a year and thousands of comments. I wrote a number of followups, including\nsome that got me labeled \"brainwashed by the patriarchy\" by other feminist women.\nSome of the guys I was talking to got me interested in the \"pickup artist subculture\" or\n\"seduction community\" -- a group of men who trade tips, tricks, and tactics on how to\nseduce women. Eventually, I did an in-depth investigation of that subculture and wrote\nthe book Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser: Long Interviews with Hideous Men,\nwhich contains some of my best work on masculinity, communication, and sexuality. You\ncan buy that on Smashwords at this link:\nhttps://www.smashwords.com/books/view/144451\nOne thing I've discovered over the last few years, as I learned more about the history of\nfeminism, is that there are excellent reasons why most feminists are unwilling to talk\nabout men's problems. There's a ton of politics involved, and a lot of very justified fears\nabout the political ground we could lose. We still have a long way to go when it comes to\ngender equality. But I do believe that those fears are often overblown.\nAnd I've also discovered that there's a subgroup of feminists that's much more likely to be\nopen to talking about men's experience: it's the sex-positive feminists, especially the\nS&M feminists. To be sure, there are exceptions. Plenty of S&M feminists see no reason\nto discuss men's experience, and of course, plenty of S&M feminists don't like my writing\nin particular. But most feminist essays I've found about masculinity were written by\nwomen who openly admitted that they were into S&M -- Gayle Rubin, author of the\npioneering sexuality essay \"Thinking Sex,\" is one good example. Maybe the S&M\nfeminists are the ones most likely to intuitively understand that power is never a onedimensional\npicture or a one-way street.\n* * *\nQuestions I Want To Ask Entitled Cis Het Men, Part 1: Who Cares?\nWhy do I care about masculinity?\nI'm rather perverted, but not enormously queer. I present as femme, and -- although I've\nbeen known to tease my sensitive (frequently long-haired) lovers for being\n\"unmasculine\" -- I fall in love with men. I'm hardly one to go for the \"manly man\" type,\nbut at heart, I love knowing that I'm fucking a man.\nHowever, because I'm cisgendered and straight, I feel profoundly at a loss when trying to\narticulate problems of (for lack of a better phrase) \"Men's Empowerment.\" The issues\ndon't feel \"native\" to me; I've intersected with these questions mainly through the lens of\nlovers and friends. Watching their struggle is demoralizing, but trying to imagine how I\ncan give them feedback is more demoralizing.\nA male friend once wrote to me, \"I think you personally find expressions of\nmasculinity hot, but you also have no patience with sexism. You've caught on that it's\ntricky for men to figure out how to deliver both of these things you need, that you don't\nhave a lot of good direction to give to fellas about it, and that neither does anyone else.\"\nSo:\nHow can men be supportive and non-oppressive while remaining overtly masculine?\nOn top of my limited perspective, there's been an echoing lack of discourse -- that is, very\nlittle mainstream acknowledgement of the problems of masculinity. The primary factor in\nthat silence is that normative cis men themselves tend to be flatly unwilling to discuss\ngender/sex issues. Often, their first objection is that the discussion is neither important\nnor relevant. This is true even within subcultures centered around sexual analysis, like the\nBDSM world -- I once met a cis male BDSMer who said, \"Why bother talking about\nmale sexuality? It's the norm. Fish don't have a word for water.\"\nBut if masculine sexuality is water and we're fish, why doesn't that motivate us to\nexamine it more -- not less?\nDon't get me wrong: I agree that America's sexual conceptions are centered around\nstereotypical male sexuality, and I agree that this is damaging and problematic. Believe\nme, I'm furious that it took me many years to reconceive \"actual\" sex around acts other\nthan good ole penis-in-vagina penetration! But if American stereotypes and ideas of\nsexuality are male-centered, then surely that makes it more useful for us to be thinking\nabout male sexuality -- not less.\nAnd those male-centered ideas of sexuality aren't centered around all men -- just\nstereotypical men. LGBTQ men are obvious examples whose sexuality falls outside the\nnorm; fortunately for them, they've created some spaces to discuss that. But there are lots\nof other non-normative guys who aren't gay or queer, yet feel very similar sexual\nalienation -- and because there's so little discourse about masculinity outside LGBTQ\ncircles, they usually just don't talk about it.\nWhat does it mean to be a cis het man whose sexuality isn't normative? Which straight\ncis guys don't fit -- and hence, feel alienated from -- our current overarching sexual\nstereotypes?\nGuys who identify as straight BDSM submissives are one fabulous example of nonnormative\nmen who are frequently alienated from mainstream masculine sexuality, but\nwho often don't have a forum. Men with small penises are a second. There are lots of\nothers. In the words of sex blogger and essayist Thomas Millar: \"The common\nunderstanding of male sexuality is a stereotype, an ultra-narrow group of desires and\nactivities oriented around PIV [penis-in-vagina], anal intercourse and blowjobs; oriented\naround cissexual women partners having certain very narrow groups of physical\ncharacteristics.\"\nStill, that doesn't mean that straight, dominant, big-dicked dudes who love boning thin\nchicks feel totally okay about the current state of affairs. It just means they tend to have\nless immediate motivation to question it. They also have less of an eye for spotting\ngender oppression, because -- though they've got their own boxes hemming them in --\nthey're still more privileged than the rest of us, and the nature of privilege is to blind the\nprivileged class to its existence.\nA male submissive once told me, \"Lots of heteronormative men know something is\nwrong with the way we think about sex and gender. I can see them struggling with it\nwhen we talk. They can't put their finger on it; they have a hard time engaging it. But I\nengage it all the time; I have to, because my sexuality opposes it.\"\nWhen is it to a man's advantage to examine and question masculinity and stereotypes of\nmale sexuality? Which men are motivated to do so?\nIt's tempting to assert that men whose desires fit neatly (or at least mostly) within the\nstereotype have it made -- after all, their sexuality works within the norm so many of us\nstruggle to escape. But I've had this assumption corrected several times, usually by smart\n\"stereotypical\" men themselves. At one point, while developing a sexuality workshop, I\nsent the outline to a bunch of friends. The original draft contained this paragraph: \"Our\nsexual scripts favor a certain stereotype of men and male sexual pleasure, which makes it\nhard for women to figure out what we really want and what we really enjoy, and also\nmakes it harder for non-stereotypical men to figure that out.\" One friend sent that\nparagraph back, having quietly appended: \"... as well as for stereotypical men to discover\nor explore new desires beyond the stereotypical script.\"\nWhen we discuss the limitations around sexuality from a non-normative perspective, how\ndo we exclude normative people who might develop themselves in new directions if they\nhad the chance? What do normative men stand to gain by thinking outside the box about\nmasculinity and sexuality?\n* * *\nQuestions I Want To Ask Entitled Cis Het Men, Part 2: Men's Rights\nIn the 2006 documentary \"Boy I Am\", a trans man talks about how one of his mental\nbarriers to transitioning was the fact that after transition, he would be a \"white male.\"\nAnd, he laughs, the \"last thing in the world\" he wanted to be was a white male!\nA year or two ago, I attended a lecture by Jackson Katz, a rather overtly masculine, cis\nmale anti-abuse educator who lectures in colleges around the country. Bullet-headed and\naggressive in stance, he said a lot of valuable things -- particularly about how men ought\nto take ownership of problems we traditionally consider \"women's issues.\" It's certainly\ntrue that if we want to end male abuse of women, men must participate in the movement.\nBut although Katz discussed some issues of masculinity, I heard little about how we can\nmake things better for men. His proposition of a men's movement was centered around\ncorrecting the things some men are doing wrong.\nAlthough they're often watered down, many feminist concepts have gone mainstream.\nFor instance, Americans have some consciousness of traditional feminist critiques about\nhow women's bodies are represented in the media. Indeed, that consciousness has become\nso endemic that, in a grandly ironic twist, marketers now capitalize on it to sell beauty\nproducts: the nationwide Dove Campaign for Real Beauty attempts to use\ndeconstruction of the media's representation of women to sell Dove soap. Americans\nare also quite aware of men as the privileged class -- sometimes regarded outright as the\noppressors.\nBut this shift in awareness about gender issues faced by women has not been\naccompanied by a widespread understanding of gender issues faced by men. And that\ncreates situations like an activist working towards a masculinity movement that talks\nmainly about how men are hurting women, or a trans man who has trouble with the idea\nof transitioning partly because he doesn't want to be a white man -- one of the oppressors.\nHow can awareness of oppressive dynamics make it difficult for men to own their\nmasculinity? Does male privilege ever make life harder for men? When does male\nprivilege blind us to oppression of masculinity? There's some mainstream awareness of\ngender issues faced by women; is there any similar awareness of the problems of\nmasculinity?\nA good friend of mine first caught my attention by talking about gender. We encountered\neach other at a BDSM meetup, and when I mentioned that I'd been thinking about the\nboxes around masculine sexuality, he launched into a rant about oppressive sexual\ndynamics. He gave me references to complex sexuality blogs and intelligently used\nwords like \"heteronormative\" and \"patriarchy.\" But a month or so after we started talking,\nI mentioned his interest in gender issues... and he gave me a puzzled look. \"I'm not really\ninto gender studies,\" he said.\nHe talks about sex, gender and culture all the time -- but he also specifically identifies as\nhighly masculine, and felt that to be at odds with identifying as someone who questions\nmasculinity. As Thomas Millar writes in his aforementioned article: \"There's a huge\nunstated assumption that to even address the question [of male sexuality], for men, is to\nmark one's self as 'other.' ... cis het men are brought up to fear that their masculinity could\never be called into question. By even opening up a dialog, I think some folks fear that\nthey are conceding that their sexuality is not uncontroversial.\"\nMen currently experience this problem in a way that women do not. In other words,\nwomen don't risk being seen as unfeminine as easily as men risk being seen as\nunmasculine; nor do we have quite the same fears about it. In 2008, a group of\nresearchers published a paper called \"Precarious Manhood.\" Their concluding statement:\n\"Our findings suggest that [so-called] real men experience their gender as a tenuous\nstatus that they may at any time lose and about which they readily experience anxiety and\nthreat.\" Earlier in the paper, they wrote that -- although \"our focus on manhood does not\ndeny the importance of women's gender-related struggles\" -- \"Women who do not live up\nto cultural standards of femininity may be punished, rejected, or viewed as 'unladylike,'\nbut rarely will their very status as women be questioned in the same way as men's status\noften is.\"\nWhen is it to a man's disadvantage to publicly examine and question masculinity? Surely\nthe mere act of questioning and examining gender does not make a man less masculine;\nhow can we work against the perception that it does?\nAt the same time, though, this isn't a \"with us or against us\" situation: men who don't\nchoose to identify as non-normative also don't tend to join the \"opposition.\" By\n\"opposition\" I mean folks like \"Men's Rights Activists\" (on the Internet we call them\nMRAs). MRAs -- at least according to my stereotype of them -- are conscious of social\nand legal disadvantages suffered by men, such as the fact that men are at a severe\ndisadvantage in child custody cases; at the same time, they're blind to male privilege. It's\na deadly combination. My personal favorite MRA quotation ever is, \"White men are the\nmost discriminated-against group in the country.\" Mercifully, MRAs are a fringe group,\nbut they make a big impression.\nMy \"not into gender studies\" friend once told me that although he frequently deconstructs\nproblems of masculinity in the privacy of his own mind, he doesn't like to publicly have\nthose conversations because he doesn't want to sound like an MRA. He said, \"A lot of the\ntime, men who want to think seriously about masculinity won't talk about it aloud\nbecause we really don't want to be that.\" He later added, \"It's very tricky to discuss\nmasculinity yet avoid simply devolving into male entitlement. That's the crux of the\nproblem with the 'Men's Movement' assholes -- none of them are addressing the\nunderlying problems of masculinity. They're just whining about not receiving the\nprivileges their cultural conditioning tells them to expect.\"\nHow do the current \"men's rights movements\" discourage men who might, in a different\nclimate, be very interested in discussing masculinity? Assuming men can reclaim the\n\"pro-masculinity movement\" from MRAs, do any men feel motivated to do so? Can men\noccupy the middle ground between MRAs and LGBTQ, feminist, or other leftist\ndiscussions of gender -- that is, can men find space to discuss masculinity without being\naligned with \"one side or the other\"?\nAll too frequently in radical sex/gender circles, the theme has been blame. Men in\nparticular are excoriated for failing to adequately support feminism -- or criticized for\nfailing to join the fight against oppressive sex and gender norms -- but few ideas are\noffered for how men can be supportive and non-oppressive while remaining overtly\nmasculine, especially if their sexuality is normative (e.g., straight/dominant/big-dicked).\nThere are fragments: some insight might be drawn from the ways in which many BDSM\ncommunities create non-oppressive frameworks within which we have our deliciously\noppressive sex. With practice, one can get shockingly good at preserving a heavy\ndominant/submissive dynamic that still allows both partners to talk about their other\nneeds. Surely that understanding of sexual roles vs. other needs could be adapted to the\nservice of gender identity. Yet so many BDSMers still fall prey to the same old gendered\npreconceptions, and talk nonsense about how \"all women are naturally submissive\" or\nwhatever.\nDon't get me wrong: of course anyone would deserve plenty of blame if they refused to\nlet go of their entitlement, or chose not to examine the ways their behavior might\nsupport an oppressive system. But I think men exist who are willing to do those things,\nyet feel blocked from relevant discussions because participating creates anxiety about\ntheir sexual or gender identity. It strikes me as unreasonable to attack them for that.\nChoosing to present one's sexuality and/or gender identity in a normative way is not in\nitself a sin. It's not fair to expect people to fit themselves into a box that doesn't suit them\n-- not even for The All-Important Cause of better understanding sex and gender.\nWhere can we find ideas for how men can be both supportive and non-oppressive, and\novertly masculine? How can we make it to normative men's advantage to analyze\nmasculine norms? What does it look like to be masculine, but liberated from the\nstrictures of stereotypical masculinity? How can we contribute to a Men's Movement that\nencompasses all three bases -- being perceived as masculine, acknowledging male\nprivilege, and deconstructing the problems of masculinity?\n* * *\nQuestions I Want To Ask Entitled Cis Het Men, Part 3: Space for Men\nI'm about to assert something that makes me nervous, because I worry that people are\ngoing to stick me in the \"asshole MRA\" box. Don't get me wrong: I certainly don't think\nthat women have it better, overall, than men do. But I do wonder whether it might be\ngood for feminists to acknowledge that -- although we don't experience nearly as\nmuch privilege as men -- there are a lot of advantages women experience that men don't.\nBecause women aren't seen as threatening, we have an easier time doing confrontational\nthings like approaching strangers on the street. Because women aren't seen as fighters, we\nstand a lower chance of being mugged than men do. Because women are seen as\nemotional, we're given a huge amount of social space to consider and discuss our\nfeelings. I can work with and be affectionate with children far more easily than a man\ncould. I can be explicit and overt about my sexuality without being viewed as a creep.\nAnd there are at least a few recurring complaints about how trying to be masculine can\nsuck. First and foremost: that men don't feel they've been taught to process their\nemotions, or don't feel allowed to display them. Another: that they're perceived as less\nmanly if they don't achieve success through a career, especially if they aren't the main\nbreadwinner for their family. A third: that men are expected to be sexually insatiable, or\nalways to be sexually available.\nOf course, it's worth noting that the advantages women experience are almost always the\nflip side of unfortunate stereotypes. For instance, one might say that women get more\nsocial space for emotion because we're stereotyped as irrational and hysterical. But that\ndoesn't change the fact that most of us easily grasp that space, while most men don't. And\nif we can reject the Oppression Olympics for just one minute and stop thinking about\nwho's got it worse, it becomes clear that the advantages and drawbacks associated with\nbeing both male and female are intertwined. The two systems reinforce, and cannot\nfunction without, each other. The gender binary may not hurt everyone equally, but it\nhurts everyone. As those beautiful \"Every Girl / Every Boy\" posters say, the most\nobvious example is: \"For every girl who is tired of acting weak when she is strong, there\nis a boy tired of appearing strong when he feels vulnerable.\"\nI do suspect that it may not be psychologically realistic to ask people from our underdogloving\nculture to embrace an image of themselves as privileged; my thoughts turn again\nto the trans man who hated the thought of being a white male. But if we feminists can't\nwork productively from a stance that acknowledges our social advantages, how can we\nexpect straight/dominant/big-dicked men to do it?\nCould feminist acknowledgment of the women's gender-based advantages help pave the\nway for more men to acknowledge male privilege? Could feminist acknowledgment of the\nadvantages on both sides of the gender binary help us better grasp what sucks about\nbeing a guy?\nAm I citing Thomas MacAulay Millar too much here? Well, at least once, he frustrated\nme. Amongst the comments on one blog post, I thought he was stating his views about\nstereotypical guys rather harshly. I suggested that it might be better to seek common\nground, or at least to explain things gently; he said he wasn't interested -- \"I think we all\nwork with some people where they are and can't soft-sell our views enough to deal with\nothers.\" He added, \"If I'm going to alienate someone for saying what I think too bluntly,\nI'll pick entitled cis het dudes.\"\nI won't pretend I didn't laugh when I read that -- but I worried about it, too. I've had an\nenormous number of experiences trying to discuss feminism/sex/gender with men in\nwhich the men tensed, bristled, and closed me out. I don't think it was always because\nthose guys couldn't stand the thought of losing their privilege, either. I think a lot of\ndudes have been led to feel that they have no place in gender discussions -- that those\ndiscussions will always be about what men are doing wrong, and that no one's prepared\nto work with them where they are.\nAll groups have outsiders. Movements inevitably form themselves around oppositional\nforces. As someone who's spent her share of time feeling feminist rage, I'd say that being\nfilled with feminist rage is totally understandable. And seriously, don't get me wrong: I'm\nnot giving unfeminist guys a free pass. I'm not happy about the fact that so many men are\napparently alienated from feminism because us radicals are too confrontational -- or too\nuncomfortably correct -- for their fragile masculine egos to handle. (I'm being sarcastic!\nMostly.) I'm really not happy about the fact that I've got to think about marketing antioppression\n-- in a just universe, wouldn't anti-oppression market itself?\nBut at the same time, I'm a realist. I know this isn't a just universe, and I want to use\ntactics that'll achieve my goals. Which are: I'd really like to find more men at my side in\nthe sex and gender wars. I'd really like to talk to more guys who don't see ideas stamped\nwith feminism as an attack -- rather, as an opportunity for alliance. Plus, if we're going to\nthink in terms of cold hard tactics, it's worth noting that normative men hold most of the\npower in America. (That's part of what we're complaining about, right?) So swelling our\nranks with The Oppressive Class means we can ruthlessly use their power for good.\nCan we do better at making feminist discourses around gender and sexuality open to\nnormative men, without driving ourselves crazy? How can we make our movement open\nto, and accepting of, normative men? Put another way, how do we convince normative\nmen to support us?\nMaybe we don't need a lot of normative men in the camp of sex and gender radicals;\nmaybe we'll be happier without silly Gender Studies 101 questions clotting our\ndiscussions. Still, even if we don't try to \"recruit\" them, I'd love to see more widespread\nanalysis of masculinity and masculine sexuality amongst normative dudes... if only\nbecause getting a sense for their societal boxes might simply make them happier. If only\nbecause I think they've got their own liberation to strive for.\nSo at the very least, I'd like to contribute to an America where serious examination of\nmasculinity and male sexuality can flourish.\nThat's my final question. How do I do it?\n* * *\nThe above entries originally appeared at:\nand\nand\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2009/10/18/questions-i-want-to-ask-entitled-cis-het-menpart-1/\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2009/10/20/questions-i-want-to-ask-entitled-cis-het-menpart-2-mens-rights/\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2009/10/24/questions-i-want-to-ask-entitled-cis-het-menpart-3-space-for-men/\nThe first followup (plus many many comments) is available at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2009/12/09/manliness-and-feminism-the-followup/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nEDUCATION:\n[theory] Sexual ABCs in Africa, Part 1: Abstinence\nIn 2009-2010, I spent a year in sub-Saharan Africa working on HIV mitigation. It was\nfascinating, frustrating, heartbreaking work. I learned an enormous amount about the\npossibilities and pitfalls of foreign aid, public health, and global injustice -- far more\nthan I could ever summarize in an introductory paragraph. Maybe someday I'll write\nmore about it all, but in the meantime, if my articles leave you with an appetite for more,\nthen I recommend two wrenching books: Letting Them Die: Why HIV/AIDS Prevention\nProgrammes Fail by Catherine Campbell, and The Wisdom of Whores: Bureaucrats,\nBrothels and the Business of AIDS by Elizabeth Pisani. (Pisani's book in particular gave\nme so many moments of recognition that I was almost offended. I was like, dammit,\nElizabeth Pisani, this is the book I wanted to write!)\nIn early 2010, while I was still in Africa, I began writing a series of articles about my\nexperiences. These articles were published at CarnalNation.com and edited by Chris\nHall, who is a smart sex-positive writer in his own right. I'm especially grateful to Chris\nbecause, unlike a lot of editors, he made the effort to grasp where I was coming from; he\nalways made requests rather than demands, and never changed my work without\nconsulting me. Good editors are hard to come by, and I hope that when I edit other\nwriters' work today, I do credit to the model Chris provided.\nI'm sad to report that CarnalNation ceased publishing new articles in late 2010,\nalthough you can still read the archives online (and I encourage you to do so). There are\na lot of \"sex-positive\" websites out there that have little real understanding of sex\ncommunities, activism, etc. -- not to mention, there are websites that hire talented and\nethical writers, but then hide truly unethical business practices. But from what I could\ntell, CarnalNation was the real deal. The list of contributors read like a Sex-Positive All-\nStars, and I was proud to be part of it.\nSo, anyway. This is the first of a bunch of articles that I originally wrote about sex and\nculture in southern Africa. Like all my writing, it's framed within my own experience.\n(I'm not republishing all the Africa articles in this book, but they're all available in my\nCarnalNation archive.) And before we get into it, I would like to note one final thing.\nOne problem with how many Westerners write about Africa is that they treat Africa as\n\"one country\": there's little acknowledgment that Africa is a huge, diverse continent full\nof many different cultures. I try to avoid that, but I also write under a pseudonym, and\nthus I can't write too precisely about where I was or what I did in Africa. I'm sorry about\nthat, and I hope I don't come off as too much of a colonialist asshole.\n* * *\nSexual ABCs in Africa, Part 1: Abstinence\nIn the beginning of 2009, I made a name for myself as a sex-positive, pro-BDSM\neducator in Chicago -- and no one was more surprised than me by how suddenly\nsuccessful I was! I curated the explosive pro-sex, pro-queer, pro-kink documentary film\nseries Sex+++ at Jane Addams Hull-House Museum. I lectured on both BDSM and\nsexual communication in Chicago, San Francisco and New York. I even fielded a call\nfrom Oprah's office! Then, just as my life was going all crazy, I was offered a job doing\nHIV/AIDS mitigation in southern Africa. I've wanted to do it for years, so I accepted --\nthough not without some soul-searching.\nRather a change of pace, right? I thought I might even give up basic romance by coming\nhere... but not so fast. Only a month after moving, I met a guy I really liked. He's another\nAmerican, also here to work on HIV/AIDS; we live a bit far apart, but flirted constantly\nby text message. We discussed etymology, traded literary recommendations, compared\nreligion -- I'm Unitarian, he's a Baha'i convert. He lived one summer in Chicago, and we\ndiscovered that we'd shopped at the same bookstores.\nOne night, we found ourselves in the same nightclub. Using a cigarette as an excuse to go\noutside, we abandoned the music and talked for hours. Our friends came to check on us\nmultiple times, with varying degrees of smirking insinuation; we kept promising to go\nback in after one cigarette, then neglecting to actually smoke it. The conversation went\nthrough homesickness, ethics, roleplaying games, more literature. I lent him a book. He\npromised to visit me.\nHis next text message, a few days later, was plainly nervous. Can you imagine someone\nblurting a text message? That's what he did when he told me that he takes the \"no sex\nbefore marriage\" part of his Baha'i faith seriously. I was stunned -- but I had to laugh,\ntoo. Of course Miss Clarisse Thorn, pro-sex advocate, just had to fixate on a man who\nwouldn't sleep with her!\n* * *\nI did not undergo abstinence-only sex education. My middle school's health teachers were\nadmirably forthright and even hosted condom demonstrations in the auditorium, more\npower to 'em. I also had the good fortune to be raised Unitarian -- so I received incredibly\ncompassionate, complete sex education in Sunday School.\nStill, for a long time I was strongly attracted to chastity. In my teens, I decided that I\nwouldn't lose my virginity until I was much older -- I think I picked age 25 -- because I\nwanted to be sure I'd be mature enough to handle it. This resolution didn't last, but after I\nbecame sexually active, I occasionally came back to the idea. A few female friends took\n\"time off\" -- in some cases, full years of abstinence. I considered doing so myself,\nstrongly and for a long time.\nBack then, I was terrible at communicating about sex. Reading explicit sex scenes made\nme feel anxious, perhaps because I felt they set standards I couldn't \"perform.\" Talking\nexplicitly to my partners felt impossible, not least because I had practically no idea what I\nwanted. Worst of all, I could feel the societal boxes around my sexuality, but I couldn't\narticulate them. Plus, there were dark undercurrents to my sexuality that simply scared\nme. Abstinence was the only obvious way around my sex-negative cultural baggage!\nOnce I adjusted into my BDSM orientation, once I got a grip on how to circumvent some\nproblems with how Americans tend to think about sex, once I experienced mutual sexual\ncommunication that was totally trusting and adventurous... my attraction to chastity was\ngreatly reduced. These days, the idea only seems awesome when (a) I've just been\nromantically burned, or (b) I want more time to myself.\nIt's tempting to think that Mr. Chastity might be the same way: that he's uncomfortable\nfor similar reasons; that he'll \"get over it.\" Tempting -- and offensively presumptuous.\nMaybe he'll re-examine his motives someday, and maybe he won't. The important thing is\nto respect his feelings. So when he sent me that text, I did what any responsible sexpositive\ngirl ought to do: I honored his boundaries and thought seriously about whether I\ncould work within them.\nI wrote back:\nI think it's adorable that you told me the vow thing by text- & on a serious note, I rather\nadmire you for challenging yourself & social expectations of masculinity. I can't afford\nexegesis of my sexual history by text; we can talk about it when you visit- which I hope\nyou do, even if you insist on sleeping on the floor. I promise not to push you- though I\nconfess I'm curious about the vow's limits. But I also understand if you don't feel\ncomfortable coming down.\nHis relief, in our next few exchanges, was palpable. I think a man who wants to abstain\nhas a far trickier journey ahead of him than a woman: America's sexual assumptions may\nbe formed around stereotypical male sexuality -- which really sucks for women -- but it's\na very narrow stereotype that limits men too. Men are expected to be insatiable, and\npreferring not to have sex casts a man's entire masculinity into question. His abstinence\ncan cause anxiety for the female partner, too: after all, given an assumption that men are\nnigh-indiscriminate sex machines, a woman might feel that there's something terribly\nwrong with her if a man won't bang her.\nMr. Chastity has dealt with those problems a lot, so my careful reaction and evident lack\nof anxiety won me lots of points. Since then, I've met up with him publicly twice, and\nwe've even managed to make out! He's still going to visit. Maybe I can convince him to\nsleep in bed, as long as I promise not to put the moves on him.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, his vow allows him to practice BDSM... a girl can dream, right?\nBut seriously, if we can do BDSM together, then I just might be his dream partner. I'd be\nhappy to focus our sexual time on BDSM and foreplay, and to ignore \"actual\" sex\nindefinitely. Plus, some people argue that declining to sate ourselves sexually is the best\ntactic for prolonging romantic magic. So this could be the way for Mr. Chastity to\nbecome the love of my life.\n* * *\nIn Africa, the mantra for HIV educators is ABC: the three things that protect against HIV/\nAIDS are Abstinence, Being faithful, and Condom usage. But my job is much more\ncomplicated than passing out condoms and wagging my finger. The problem isn't so\nmuch that people don't know how to avoid HIV, although myths and misconceptions do\nexist. The problem is that people don't seem willing to change their behavior in order to\nprotect themselves... or that they don't feel they have the power to change their behavior.\nPeople can't just know about condoms -- they must prioritize condom usage despite\ndrawbacks like loss of pleasure or pressure from their partners. People can't just know\nthat HIV is sexually transmitted -- they must be psychologically open to abstaining from\nsex despite drawbacks that are, well, obvious. HIV prevention in Africa is less about\nsharing knowledge, now, and more about marketing: giving people a new perspective on\nsex, their health, and their futures.\nOf course, I'm totally psyched about marketing some of these social aspects, like gender\nequality. (Gender equality is an HIV/AIDS issue for lots of reasons -- the most obvious\nbeing that the less power women have, the less they control their own sexual acts.) But\nothers give me pause. Abstinence? Seriously? It sticks in my craw. Obviously, I don't\nhave a problem with people choosing not to have sex... but I'm not sure how I feel about\nactively convincing people not to have sex.\nIn America, I advocate for open, explicit, pleasure-affirming sex education. But that's a\nradical stance even in America -- I'm not sure whether it's possible here! At least I'm\nspotting a few allies, some in unexpected places: for instance, there's a great high-profile,\noutspoken sex-positive educator named Agrippa Khathide in South Africa... who happens\nto be a pastor. I'm starting to think there's room to do fascinating work here, creating\nculturally appropriate sex-positive education.\nYet abstinence remains the only 100% effective tactic for avoiding HIV. As another\neducator told me, \"I hate abstinence-only education more than anything. Seriously. But...\nhere, I think it's a necessary ingredient.\" Is it responsible for me to avoid promoting\nabstinence? Even if marketing abstinence means that to some extent, I'll have to tell\npeople sexual exploration isn't worth doing?\nI'm still feeling out my approach, but... what if the most effective way to fight HIV is to\nalign myself with values antithetical to free sexuality? Does properly doing my job\nrequire me to promote a sex-negative agenda? Surely not. Surely there are ways to\npromote sex-positive abstinence -- perhaps a \"Vibrators for African Women\" program...?\n(This is a joke. Mostly.)\nAnd that's just one facet of the broader question keeping me awake at night! Which is:\ngiven a fatal, incurable sexually transmitted infection; given a population where, in some\ngroups, up to 40% test positive; given a society in which culturally appropriate messages\nemphatically do not include my pro-sex, pro-queer, pro-kink approach to sex education...\nwhat does being a sex-positive educator mean?\nMaybe I can harvest clues from my own feelings, past and present, about abstinence:\nclues for how to promote it compassionately, effectively and responsibly; clues for\nlocating my boundaries when I talk about it. And maybe I can harvest down-to-earth\nadvice from my relationship with Mr. Chastity, too. I can work from toxic masculine\nnorms he's had such trouble with, and examine how men in southern Africa might\nlikewise worry about abstinence -- if you think American men have tough definitions of\nsexual manliness to contend with, then try living in a place where the big men have\nmultiple wives and over a dozen children. I also think it'll be hot to be bound against\ngoing \"too far.\" Maybe I can learn how abstinence is fun, fun, fun!\nHey, at the very least, it'll give me a taste of what I'm telling everyone else to do.\n* * *\nThe original version of this article can be found on the Internet, but please note that I've\ndone some editing for clarity. Here's the original:\nhttp://carnalnation.com/content/45211/1133/sexual-abcs-africa-part-1-abstinence\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nEDUCATION:\n[theory] Sexual ABCs in Africa, Part 2: Be Faithful\nThis is the second in the three-part \"Sexual ABCs\" series, but I originally intended it to\nbe the last one, because it's the most complicated by far.\n* * *\nSexual ABCs in Africa, Part 2: Be Faithful\nSouth African President Jacob Zuma has three wives; in a headline-making ceremony, a\nSouth African businessman recently married four women at once. King Mswati of\nSwaziland has thirteen wives, and his father King Sobhuza had 70. (Yes. Seventy.) Here\nin southern Africa, even those rich men who don't take multiple wives almost always\nsupport mistresses. Naturally, local women don't get multiple spouses, and the social\npenalties for infidelity are much worse for women. In America, feminists often point out\nthat \"slut\" is an insult while \"stud\" is a compliment; there's a similar linguistic trend in\nsiZulu, but the English words are mild compared to their siZulu equivalents.\n* * *\nI rarely practice consensual non-monogamy myself, but I don't hesitate to advocate\ndestigmatizing polyamory and swing in America. True, my primary interest is BDSM,\nbut there's so much to learn from every form of consensual sexuality. Plus, we're\nbasically on the same side -- it'd be great if different sex subcultures had more\nconsciousness of a sex-positive \"agenda\" or \"movement\"! Although our communities\nhave different emphases and, sometimes, profoundly different values, I see swingers and\npolyfolk as my brothers- and sisters-in-arms.\nBut enough of the soapbox! The point is that I've often defended poly -- and I've gotten\ninto interesting arguments doing so. One friend noted just how hard it is for poly people\nto negotiate their relationships. \"It's so complicated,\" he complained. \"So much\ncommunication is required. Doesn't that seem like an argument against it? If polyamory\nwere really a good relationship model, then people wouldn't have to put so much effort\ninto accomplishing it.\"\n\"It's only complicated because polyamory isn't our societal default,\" I replied. \"People\nhave to put extra effort into negotiating relationships that fall outside the norm. The same\nthing happens with BDSM. Kinksters must spend a lot more time discussing our sexual\nrelationships, because it's more dangerous for us to make assumptions about where our\npartners want to go. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with kink.\n\"And,\" I added, \"that extra effort can be a feature, not a bug! The fact that kinksters spend\nso much time isolating different aspects of our sexuality has given us a uniquely finegrained\nsexual vocabulary. I think most kinksters tend to make fewer assumptions about\nour partners' boundaries than vanilla people do. And circumstances have forced us to\ndevelop some brilliant strategies for bedroom communication. I'm not saying we're all\nbrilliant communicators, but I think we've got a unique window on it. When I run sexual\ncommunication workshops, half the tactics I share are filched from the BDSM\nsubculture; I just rename them for a general audience. Many polyfolk have similar\ninsights about relationship communication.\"\nBeing in southern Africa, seeing all these men partnered with multiple women, has\nbrought that conversation to mind. Because the majority of men can't afford multiple\nwives and some churches frown on the practice, polygyny isn't exactly the default -- but\nit's certainly a well-respected, highly desirable relationship formation. (Polygyny is the\nmost precise term for the type of polygamy that's practiced here, where men can have\nmultiple wives but women can't have multiple husbands. However, a lot of Africans\nsimply call it \"polygamy.\")\nAnd men who can't go the open route frequently do the same thing discreetly. In the July\n2009 issue of New African Magazine, Akua Djanie -- who moved to England at age 10\nand grew up there -- observes: \"I know very few African men, especially those living on\nthe continent, who keep only one partner. The majority of men I come across are in\nmultiple relationships, sometimes open, but most times on the quiet.\" She also notes that\n\"in some instances, a man's manhood is judged by the number of women he can keep.\"\nSo monogamy is not the default; and negotiating monogamy is difficult, here. But a new\nfactor makes it a matter of life and death: HIV.\n* * *\nThe basic centerpiece of HIV prevention is ABC -- Abstinence, Being faithful, and using\nCondoms. But the three strategies haven't always received equal airtime. \"The Fidelity\nFix,\" a 2004 New York Times Magazine article by Helen Epstein, quoted one analyst who\nbelieved \"partner reduction has been the neglected middle child of the ABC approach.\"\nEpstein wrote, \"Perhaps the topic seems weighted with moral judgment; perhaps Western\nadvisors in particular feel it would be insensitive to raise it; perhaps they also feel it\nwould be futile to try to change deeply rooted patterns of behavior.\" She outlined those\npatterns and concluded, \"A fidelity campaign does seem worth a try, even if it might\nseem overly simplistic and preachy.\" Another expert, quoted in a 2007 Washington Post\npiece on multiple partners in Botswana, agreed: \"There has never been equal emphasis on\n'Don't have many partners'.... If you just say, 'Use the condom'... we will never see the\ndaylight of the virus leaving us.\"\nLiving in southern Africa now, it seems clear that this recommendation has been taken to\nheart. I regularly spot posters, stickers and billboards for fidelity campaigns that\napparently didn't exist a few years ago. Although cultural pride is a big deal here, locals\nroutinely disparage risky marriage-related cultural practices: for instance, many speak\nharshly against wife inheritance, whereby a woman whose husband has died is\ntraditionally expected to marry his brother. Many such practices are becoming more and\nmore unusual. However, the larger phenomenon of polygyny seems harder to budge.\nI recently sat in on a partner reduction dialogue for one town's church leaders; it was\nattended by representatives both from churches that allow polygamous marriages, and\nthose that don't. The discussion was quite civil, though one anti-polygamy preacher did\nmake snide comments towards the polygamists. They talked about issues like an absence\nof marriage counseling, preachers' failure to act as positive role models, and churches'\nfailure to be transparent about HIV. (The all-male group also noted \"women's selfish\nimpatience with erectile dysfunction,\" \"women preferring men who last longer,\" \"women\npreferring men with a lot of money,\" and \"women not loving their husbands enough\" as\ncontributing factors to fidelity failure.) The group seemed pleased to work together, and\neager to address the problem. The question of members being pro- or anti-polygamy was,\napparently, only a side note.\nAs it happens, there are plenty of polygamy problems that have nothing to do with\nHIV/AIDS. These divisions would exist without the disease. For instance, some\npreachers who don't support polygamy will sanction divorce and remarriage. One man\ntold me that \"true\" polygamous marriage -- in which a man has many wives, all supported\nsimultaneously -- is slowly being replaced: rich men now often take younger wives, but\ndivorce and cast aside the previous wives first. The \"new\" approach looks suspiciously\nlike the Western model of \"serial monogamy\"... except that the women, left with few\nresources, rarely marry again. (The gender inequality is highlighted when only one\npartner has HIV: an HIV-positive man will likely be nursed by his wife, while HIVpositive\nwomen can fear anything from abuse to abandonment.) Partly because\nabandonment is getting so common and partly due to doctrinal interpretations, there is yet\na third group of church leaders who not only reject polygamy but refuse to remarry\ndivorced people.\nMost interestingly, I've noticed that from some perspectives, the current system appears\nto stack the moral deck in favor of polygyny. A lot of the time, people will claim that\nthere are only three alternatives: (1) abandonment and/or deadbeat fatherhood, (2)\ncheating, or (3) overt polygyny. If those are the alternatives, then even empowered\nwomen will argue in favor of polygyny -- though not happily, since they're quite\nconscious that a system supporting polygamy without polyandry is completely unfair.\nFor example, in the aforementioned July 2009 New African piece, titled \"The Sins of Our\nFathers,\" Akua Djanie reflects bitterly upon a father who ignored her mother in favor of\nhis second wife. She writes that she \"will encourage [her sons] to have a relationship with\nonly one woman at a time. And if they make the mistake of having children from\ndifferent women, I will make sure they are responsible for each and every one of them.\"\nThen, however, she asserts that \"although I myself would never wish to be in such a\n[polygamous] relationship, I think it can work, does work, and has worked in the past\";\nthat \"the issue is not so much with the pros and cons of polygamy, but more with the\nirresponsible behavior of some men\"; and that \"African men are still as polygamous as\nthey were in my father's heyday. In fact I believe that polygamy will never go away.\"\nDjanie doesn't mention HIV once.\n(It's worth noting that Djanie is very aware of Western cultural imperialism; she loathes\nand deconstructs those who downgrade African culture in favor of Western. For instance,\nher November 2009 New African piece was about how frustrating it is that Africans\nusually model Christmas on Western standards, showing images of white children\nfrolicking in Alpine snow. Thus, her argument against polygamy is especially striking.)\nRecently, I spoke to some grassroots HIV educators who go door-to-door in their rural\nvillages. They keep a list of different prevention tactics that they discuss with their\nneighbors. Glancing through, I saw both Zero Grazing and Be Faithful side-by-side. \"I\ndon't understand the difference between these two,\" I said, prompting the educators to\nconfer amongst themselves in siZulu. Finally, one offered, \"Be Faithful is about\nmonogamy with one partner. Zero Grazing is about having multiple wives and not going\noutside the marriage.\" The others seemed to agree. Given their limited English and my\nlimited siZulu, I decided not to ask: \"Does promoting both strike you as a mixed\nmessage?\" (I did ask whether they think people listen to their advice. In response, they\njust looked depressed.)\nClearly, the fidelity fix has arrived. What's harder to determine is how much, and in what\nmanner, the message is being emphasized -- not to mention, whether it's actually taking\nroot.\n* * *\nGiven my experience with polyamory, and my nigh-rabid promotion of straightforward\ncommunication as the Cure For All Ills, I can't help wondering: would it help to port\ncommunication tactics from our polyamorous allies over to southern Africa? But\npolyamory is fundamentally different from polygyny. Polyamory assumes that both\npartners have equal footing -- equal negotiating status -- whereas polygyny assumes that\nmen are entitled to privileges women aren't. Would it be possible to take the lessons of\neven-handed polyamory, and apply them to polygyny?\nWhat if I choose not to address polygyny -- to avoid the whole culturally fraught debate,\nand just create relationship communication workshops inspired by polyamorous (and\nBDSM) analysis? (That way, with no one alienated by an overt stance, I may reach the\naudience better anyway.) Will it work if I teach from a perspective of assumed gender\nequality? My instinct is \"yes\"; I've even found a heartening example! The well-known\nSouth African Pastor Agrippa Khathide preaches equality for women and sexual pleasure\nfor everyone (as long as they're married first, of course). He gives explicit sermons\nincluding technical sexual advice, and has been quoted in interviews asserting things like:\n\"married people should be totally free to express themselves any way they wish in the\nbedroom,\" that \"they must be willing to experiment, explore and explicitly acknowledge\nthe giving and receiving of pleasure,\" and that women are entitled to \"enjoyment of sex\nlike men.\"\nIf he can do that, surely I can do something similar! Surely, then, my inherent egalitarian\nassumptions would make a positive impact, even if I say nothing direct about irritating\nmale entitlement. Yet I worry that if I focus on relationship communication and don't\ndirectly take on the monogamy juggernaut, I will sidestep the heart of these debates.\nIndeed, not only might I be sidestepping -- I might be turning my gaze from the very\nplace I ought to focus.\n* * *\nPerhaps the hardest part about wrapping my head around a fidelity campaign isn't\nwhether certain tactics are appropriate or inappropriate, effective or ineffective. It's that\nthey can be both, or neither -- and while culture matters, it varies by individual. More to\nthe point, while culture affects attitudes towards Abstinence and Condoms, there aren't\nmany ways to interpret the implementation of those two dicta.\nThe people who live here themselves are divided about what fidelity means. Be Faithful,\nor Zero Grazing? Multiple wives, or divorce and remarriage? They themselves are\nworking towards gender equality, but have just as many arguments about its\nimplementation as Westerners do. They themselves are proud of their culture, and yet\nthere's one anti-HIV slogan that always leaps out at me when I spot it among the myriad\nof posters and stickers:\nThere is nothing cultural about dying of AIDS.\n* * *\nThe original version of this article can be found on the Internet, but please note that I've\ndone some editing for clarity.

I think a lot of people would like to believe that Africans are \"different\nfrom us\" and that's why HIV has had such an impact in Africa. And it's accurate to say\nthat certain cultural patterns influence the spread of HIV, as I described in the previous\npiece, \"Be Faithful.\"\nBut the truth is, also, that people are similar everywhere: we respond to certain\nincentives, and sexuality is one of our most powerful incentives. The terrifying truth is\nthat Africans are not especially different from us... and given the right circumstances, the\nWest can and will be equally vulnerable to this awful epidemic. And as I learned more\nand then came home, I began to see just how vulnerable we are. There are poor,\nmarginalized areas of the USA where HIV is reaching the same proportions that it has\nreached in Africa. And even among privileged young Americans, HIV rates have been\nrising for the first time in years.\n* * *\nSexual ABCs in Africa, Part 3: Condoms\nIn America, the common argument against explicit sex education -- and promoting\ncondom use in schools -- is that it will encourage kids to be promiscuous. The idea is that\nif we portray it as normal for kids to be having sex and tell them how to do it safely,\nthey'll be more likely to go and have sex. As for the kids who'll have sex anyway... well,\nthey're sinning and don't deserve to know what they're doing.\nSome things don't change, even across oceans. I occasionally hear the same arguments\nagainst promoting condom use in southern Africa. But here, HIV is ripping the populace\nto pieces, and it's much harder to speak against condoms when funeral processions wind\nthrough your neighborhood every weekend. Occasional religious educators claim that\npromoting condom usage waters down their message and therefore makes anti-HIV\neducation less effective; but most churches I've encountered take a pragmatic, condompromoting\napproach. Indeed, one of the best HIV curricula I've seen so far is the\n\"Channels of Hope\" workshop, created by the Christian organization World Vision and\ndesigned to train church groups. It not only promotes explicit condom education, but\nurges compassion towards sex workers and homosexuals. And it discusses why marital\nrape isn't okay! I'd venture to say that the majority of liberal, secular sex education\ncurricula in the USA aren't as awesome.\nJust the other day, I was surveying a bunch of kids aged 11-13 and they asked how to put\non a condom. Cursing myself silently, I had to admit that I didn't have any to show\nthem... at which point one child dashed from the room and returned minutes later bearing\nboth a condom, plus a rather splintery stick from a firewood pile. Condom distribution is\nin full swing; I can think of three places to pick up free condoms within a ten-minute\nwalk from where I'm seated. Condoms are described in kids' textbooks, and condom\ndemonstrations are welcome in every school. Condoms are lauded by politicians, pop\nicons, and religious leaders. Take any person off the street and they'll know the HIVprevention\nmantra: ABC -- Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms. Yet condom usage rates\nare still killingly low.\n* * *\nThough I'm fishbelly-pale, I'm not great at wearing sunscreen, and I live in Africa. I try...\nI mean, I kinda try... I mean it's so annoying to apply, and it feels gross! And this\nnotwithstanding the fact that I literally have ten bottles of top-quality, non-sticky, oil-free\nsunscreen sitting across the room from me as I type this. On the other hand, I religiously\ntake my malaria prophylactic pill; I've noticed no side effects, and getting malaria would\nreally suck.\nI recall one recurring conversation between myself and a former boyfriend, whom I dated\nfor years. We'd both had excellent sex education, and yet we used withdrawal as our\nprimary birth-control method. We did it even though we both had boxes of condoms\navailable. We did it even though neither of us wanted me to get pregnant, and -- though\nI'm definitely pro-choice -- I wasn't sure I could bring myself to have an abortion. We'd\nboth been tested, and we trusted each other not to cheat, but that's some dangerous trust\nto extend -- and we knew it.\nOne particular moment comes to mind: we were lying lazily in bed together, talking\nabout how stupid we were.\n\"We should be more careful,\" he said seriously.\n\"We really should,\" I agreed.\n\"Let's be more careful,\" he suggested.\nI nodded.\nWe weren't.\nWere we stupid? Obviously. Were we normal? Unfortunately, yes. A few months ago, I\nchatted with another American HIV educator about the situation here in Africa. \"They\nknow to use condoms,\" she complained, \"and they have the condoms! I just don't get it!\"\n\"I agree that it's incomprehensible,\" I said, \"but hey, I haven't always been 100% careful,\nand I'm a sex educator.\"\nShe glanced at me, then away. \"Yeah, I haven't either,\" she admitted. There was a gloomy\npause, and then we couldn't help it -- we cracked up. \"I hate love,\" she said when the\ngiggles subsided. She shook her head. \"That shit fucks with you.\"\nWhy didn't I use condoms with that ex? I still don't know! When you instruct people to\nuse condoms as often as I do, you get accustomed to the arguments. I hear the same\nreasons we didn't use condoms -- because they don't feel as good, because they interrupt\nthe moment, etc. etc. etc. -- I hear them, I smile and I tell the audience, \"You gotta use\n'em anyway, folks.\" I'm a hypocrite, but what else can I say?\nAnd there are deeper-rooted objections to condoms -- objections that are both rarely\nstated in public, and harder to confront. One is trust, which I've been struggling with for a\nlong time, since before I got to Africa. I don't think it's good for condom discussions to\ncenter on trust, and I wish I had more ideas about how to refocus them. \"Use condoms\nbecause you can't trust anyone, not even your lover,\" is an ugly message to impart.\nMoreover, it only encourages the audience to view not using condoms as a gift, or a\nsignifier of trust.\nIn America, I tend to cast it like this: \"Safer sex is normal. It's the baseline. Lots of people\npractice it. It's an assumption. Act like it.\" Which, I hope, helps people simply default to\nsafer sex without forcing direct questions about any given partner's integrity. Hopefully,\nit also distracts attention from seeing discarding condoms as a gift. But the truth is that\ncondom usage isn't always an assumption even in America (witness myself and my ex).\nAnd it's less of an assumption here in Africa. How can I avoid validating the viewpoint\nthat not using condoms is the best way to express trust?\nThe second deep-rooted objection -- again, both in Africa and America -- is inability to\nmaintain an erection while using a condom. When I was younger, I used to think that\nguys were just whining when they claimed they couldn't keep it up with a condom, but in\nmy old age I've determined that People Are Different (no way!): while most men deal\nwith condoms just fine, some men genuinely can't. Since people tend to be bad at\ncommunicating about sex and especially bad at making space for conversations about\nnon-normative male sexuality, this isn't often acknowledged. Fortunately, the solution is\neasy: men who have trouble with condomised penis-in-vagina sex gain a glorious\nopportunity to explore all the other kinds of sex!\nPeople tend to panic when confronted with the idea of a man who can't have penetrative\nsex. But that's sex-negative nonsense based entirely on the stereotype of \"real sex\" as\npenis-in-vagina intercourse. The solution to loss of erection isn't to sit around awkwardly\nwishing you could be having penetrative sex. The solution is for both partners to start\nexploring with mouths, hands... and words. But teaching about this means speaking very\nexplicitly, and it can be hard to have those conversations in a conservative society\nwithout being run out of town.\n* * *\nIn the Strange Case of Clarisse and Her Condomless Ex, I was at least Being Faithful\nwith a pre-tested partner, and I didn't live in an HIV-rich population. The risks were\nlower, and it's true that I've never run those kinds of risks outside a long-term\nmonogamous relationship. But the bottom line remains: my ex and I did it even though\nwe knew better.\nHe and I are both privileged people. Neither of us was dependent on the other for money,\nfor instance. If two highly privileged people who agree that condoms are necessary can\nfail to use condoms, what about people who don't have that privilege?\nIn many places across the world, including much of southern Africa, sex workers can\ncharge double for sex without a condom. No businesswoman is likely to insist on a\nmeasure that will halve her profits -- especially if she already lives on a razor-fine\nmargin, and especially if she's already contracted HIV herself. Likewise, if a girl can't\nafford expensive school fees and therefore sleeps with her teachers, then she's hardly in a\nposition to demand protection. Many married women quite justifiably fear divorce,\nviolence or murder if they refuse their husbands sex without a condom -- in one recent\ncase, a wife tested negative for HIV while her husband tested positive, but when she tried\nto refuse condomless sex, he killed her.\nSome pro-condom campaigns tell the populace that \"it's your responsibility: you must\nrespect your body and take the initiative\"; but while that works for some people, it's a\nterribly cruel message for people who lack the standing to negotiate with their partners.\nAdd to this the fact that, if you know enough people living with HIV -- and if your life\nalready seems difficult and directionless -- the disease will start to seem like much less of\na big deal. A friend reports that one day, sitting in a salon, she saw a man exit with a sex\nworker. \"Don't forget a condom!\" she called bluntly. His reply: \"I'm not the first to get it,\nand I won't be the last.\" (Indeed, there are documented cases of marginal populations\ndeliberately contracting HIV when they perceived benefits. For instance, when HIVpositive\nillegal immigrants in France were offered citizenship as part of a humanitarian\ninitiative, some sought out the disease.)\nPeople who ignore prophylactics will always be with us. Some of them will be like me\nand my ex, or the sex worker's client: despite knowing the risk, transient pleasure trumps\nabsolute safety. There isn't much to be done about that demographic, save ensuring that\nthey (we) truly grasp the consequences we risk with our silliness.\nSome people, however, will be vulnerable more because they're female, or young, or\npoor. In those cases, addressing the root causes -- sexism, poverty, abuse -- becomes the\nonly solution. Thus, some of the best HIV programs in southern Africa appear to address\ncompletely different issues. These include:\n* Identifying and supporting income-generating projects for women, so that they have the\nresources to walk away from abusive partners;\n* Sponsoring schools, so that they can educate for free and remove one reason a\nschoolchild might sleep with a teacher;\n* Facilitating support groups, so members can share tactics for negotiating safer sex (or,\nif already HIV-positive, help each other cope with obligations and treatment regimens);\n* Creating strong communities, so people are quite simply more motivated to live.\n* * *\nIt's always tempting to see unfamiliar cultures as monolithic, but we must remind\nourselves that they never are. Every society in the world contains its own divides, just\nlike America's culture and subcultures. Because HIV/AIDS functions along the very\ntaboo, very culturally-influenced axis of sexuality, it throws taboo cultural sexual divides\ninto high relief.\nIn America, one thing the disease's advent served to highlight was stigma towards\nLGBTQ and other radical sexual subcultures. American HIV mitigation has often sought\nto redress that stigma. Here, one thing it serves to highlight -- one thing mitigation seeks\nto redress -- is mainstream gender and relationship issues. But these splits existed before\nHIV came along. Although the prevalence of HIV sheds light on and invokes compassion\nfor these divisions, they're more enduring than we like to think.\nStill, I can't help noticing the phoenixes arising from these ashes. Firstly, it turns out that\nthe best way to shut down sex-negative arguments against explicit sex education is to\ninvoke the specter of HIV. One 2008 report from a well-respected local organization\nargued that AIDS prevention efforts should include straightforward lessons on\npleasurable acts, such as oral sex or sex toy usage! (Obviously, I hope to work with this\norganization.)\nA 2004 New York Times Magazine article on HIV in southern Africa made the case that\nwhile \"many experts contend that sexual-behavior change in Africa is complicated\nbecause women's fear of abusive partners inhibits private discussions of sex, condom use\nand HIV,\" the crisis also contributes to a better environment for those discussions. One\nresearcher is quoted pointing out that, \"young South Africans are much more likely to\ntalk about sex and are developing 'a vocabulary for discussing feelings and desires.'\"\nFurthermore, southern African movements for women's empowerment invariably cite\nHIV as a reason change is necessary now. Because gender oppression is acknowledged as\na driver of the epidemic, gender equality is an explicit goal of both governments and\nmajor HIV organizations. Even admirably reasonable laws about sex work are being\ndiscussed -- considerably more reasonable than most Western sex work legislation. The\nlaws probably won't pass, unfortunately, but at least they're on the radar.\nI've got a twisted confession to make. On days when I feel particularly flippant, I find\nmyself thinking: Thank God for HIV/AIDS! Without HIV... would women's\nempowerment be such a given? Aside from bleeding heart feminists like myself, who\nwould care about sex workers' conditions? Aside from sex-positive nuts like myself, who\nwould advocate for explicit sex education?\nHere's hoping we can create better social conditions to arrest the pandemic... and keep\nthose conditions going afterwards.\n* * *\nThe original version of this article can be found on the Internet, but please note that I've\ndone some editing for clarity.

Anti-oppression theory\nsure can get out of touch with reality.\n* * *\nColonized Libidos\nThe situation for gay / lesbian rights here in Africa has gotten lots of media attention\nlately, and I myself have written about meeting a Swazi lesbian activist who was later\nmurdered. So I won't waste your time by talking about how bad it can get to be gay here\n(although it's worth noting that I've seen at least one interesting argument about how the\nplaces in Africa where homosexuality is most heavily punished are also the ones with the\nstrongest national dialogue, and thus arguably some of the best ones to actually be gay).\nBesides, I've become somewhat numb to the situation's sheer awfulness since arriving last\nyear. What catches my attention these days is unfamiliar cultural angles and arguments.\nWhile reading the local paper, I recently came upon yet another gay-shaming article --\nbut instead of railing about God's will, the article talked about cultural imperialism.\nSpecifically, it argued that gays and lesbians are gay and lesbian only because of the\nWest. Gays and lesbians, the theory goes, have been so influenced by the Sodom and\nGomorrah that is the West that they've internalized our permissive, scandalous sexual\nmores. (Those of us who actually come from the West are, of course, a little confused by\nhow our fractured native cultures -- still fiercely arguing about homosexuality within\nthemselves -- might create such an influence.) An African proud of his or her\nAfricanness, who rejects the colonial West, will therefore not only wear African\ntraditional garb and participate in African traditional ceremonies but will also be straight.\n(Ironically, some historians have pointed out that much of Africa was much less\nhomophobic before Western missionaries came in.)\nI got a front-line view of this attitude when I took a newspaper to the Post Office for\nphotocopying. \"Another article about lesbians!\" snorted the postmaster -- they're getting\nto know me around there. He took the papers from me and shuffled through my requested\npages. \"Is it true,\" he asked, \"that President Obama supports lesbians?\"\n\"Yes,\" I said.\nHe looked shocked; I wondered if he'd expected me to say no. \"What?!\" he cried, and\ntook a moment to regain his composure. \"Well, that's American culture,\" he said finally.\n\"It's not African culture.\"\nI took a deep breath and pressed my lips together. I'd be in big trouble with my employer\nif I kicked up a storm at the Post Office, but oh, man -- in that moment, I really, really\nwanted to. \"How much do I owe you?\" I asked instead, and went home to lose myself in\na nice sex-positive book.\nPersonally, what I find most intriguing about these assertions of cultural imperialism is\nhow they compare to similar assertions in the West. I'm a kinkster and pro-BDSM\nactivist, but I'm also a feminist, which can make for some serious anxiety. A lot of my\ncoming-out process involved both a difficult internal struggle and my observations of\narguments between kinksters and anti-BDSM feminists, who often make very similar\nallegations to these African speakers on \"cultural imperialism.\"\nThe very articulate BDSM blogger Trinity (who, of late, has sadly decreased her\ninvolvement in the blogosphere) has spent lots of time analyzing and participating in\nthose arguments. One of my favorite Trinity posts, titled \"Why BDSM?\", hosts a radical\nfeminist commenter who writes:\nIf we lived in a healthy society, the idea of BDSM would not even come up in the first\nplace. BDSM is here, as a manifestation of that unhealthiness, but to try to 'stop' the\npeople who aren't being coerced into it would do more harm than the thing itself....\nI am not saying tolerance of BDSM directly causes our sick society, but that it is a very\nstrong symptom of a society were hierarchy, inequality and degradation are seen as the\nnorm of human relations. Accepting BDSM is accepting this status quo. ... by challenging\nall inequality, including that in BDSM, we are putting forward the idea that other\npossibilities are available.\nIn other words: the Patriarchy made me kinky, and if I don't challenge kink then I'm\nsupporting the Patriarchy. I would imagine that Africans pushing the cultural imperialism\nargument would say something similar: Western colonial influence made you gay, and if\nyou don't challenge homosexuality then you're supporting Western colonial influence.\nWell, \"with us or against us\" arguments are inherently flawed. And then there's the fact\nthat, similarly to homosexuals, many of us kinksters consider our desires to be innate and\nlargely unchangeable. So if our desires can't be changed, then what exactly is\naccomplished by shaming us through anti-oppressive theory-speak? (And make no\nmistake -- for those of us who take the theory seriously, it really does feel shameful to\nfind others telling us we're in opposition, even within the private sphere of sexuality.) I'm\nnot remotely convinced that our sexuality arose solely because of an oppressive society --\nbut even if it's true, then what am I, or African gay people, supposed to actually do in\norder to challenge the sick status quo? Give up on our desires and never have satisfying\nsex again?\nI tend to think that the idea of sexual orientations or innateness is a red herring -- not\nbecause I believe that innateness doesn't exist, but because it's not actually relevant to\nsexual morality. What should be important is only the question of whether all involved\nsexual partners are consenting adults, not whether their desires are innate. Alas, it's clear\nthat across the world, people who are instinctively grossed out by alternative sexuality\nwill always find ways to reframe the question into how our acts are just plain wrong and\nour consent is irrelevant -- and that's as true of some feminists and cultural loyalists as it\nis of Bible-thumpers.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://carnalnation.com/content/51544/1133/colonized-libidos\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nVEGAN:\n[theory] Confections of a Pickup Artist Chaser\nI've been vegetarian since 2009 and vegan since 2011; I wrote this in 2012.\n* * *\nConfections of a Pickup Artist Chaser\nThere are delicious recipes at the end! Read this article for the recipes!\nI feel hyper-aware that this piece may alienate some readers, because it's a post about\nbeing vegan, i.e. not eating animal products. Lot of folks are touchy about that. So, I want\nto do some pre-emptive damage control: I want to clarify up front that I have no interest\nin calling anyone an asshole. If you're not vegan, then I want to try and change your\nmind... but I don't think you're an Incontrovertibly Bad Person, and I hope we can still be\nfriends.\nAnd, look, I'm not gonna pretend I'm perfect. I screw up all the time, on all kinds of\nsocial justice issues, and I'll be learning for the rest of my life.\nFor me, the hardest thing about being vegan has nothing to do with the food, although I\nthink many foods made from animal products are delicious, and occasionally I have\ntrouble resisting them. For me, the hard part is all about social situations. If I'm at a social\nevent where non-vegan food is served and there are no other vegans, sometimes I just eat\nit -- especially if it will Become A Big Social Problem if I don't eat it. I also sometimes\neat non-vegan food that's been rescued from the trash (some of us call this \"freegan\").\nAnd occasionally, when I'm spending a lot of time with someone who's non-vegan, then\nI'll sometimes break veganism in front of them in order to reassure them that I'm not\njudging them. I have vegan friends who consider this an unacceptable level of\naccommodation; sorry folks.\nI am aware that stigmatizing, judging, and attacking non-vegans is one tactic for\nconvincing them to go vegan. Personally, I find it stressful and frequently\ncounterproductive. I'd rather set an example and be welcoming. (Yet I acknowledge that\nit's possible I wouldn't be able to do this effectively if aggressive vegans did not exist.\nAggressive vegans help create the space where I get to look \"reasonable\" and\n\"welcoming.\" The blogger Kinsey Hope once wrote a really brilliant activist typology\nthat describes these dynamics. And of course, it's worth noting that I'm often\ncharacterized as an appeaser by feminists, too.)\nSo. That said? If you think you're going to Get Upset Or Offended by this post, please\njust don't read it. Seriously. But if you're willing to not freak out for a moment, then here\nare my two primary arguments for why you should go vegan:\n1. It's easy. Yes, there will be some shitty social situations: awkward moments at\nrestaurants, pushback from your non-vegan friends, and so on. Yes, you will have to\navoid some very delicious foods. And food labels will become a whole new world of\nconfusion. But even with all these factors, veganism really isn't as hard as people\nmake it out to be.\nThere's a lot of delicious vegan food out there. A number of my favorite foods were\nvegan before I went vegan, and some of yours probably are as well. (Recipes coming up!)\nHere is a free online vegan starter guide that includes recipes. Here is a very\ncomprehensive list of vegan cookbooks; they range from \"easy\" to \"incredibly\ncomplicated Martha-Stewart-land.\" I am a fiend for baked goods, and I like Vegan\nCupcakes Take Over The World by Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero.\nAnd there's an increasing number of high-quality all-vegan restaurants. My favorite ones\nin Chicago are Native Foods (delicious cardamom rose cupcakes!) and Urban Vegan\n(delicious fake orange chicken!).\nI won't get involved in appeals-to-healthitude, because I know both healthy vegans and\nunhealthy vegans, and the science is inconclusive... but I will point that out again: the\nscience is inconclusive. Unless you have an unusual disorder, modern nutrition has\nidentified no conclusive scientific reasons for not being vegan. Plus: If you aren't\nvegan, but you don't pay any attention to eating healthy food, then you're being a\nhypocrite if you make a \"health argument\" for being non-vegan even if the science\nwas conclusive, which it's not. And! If you're really into health, there's a highlyrecommended\nbook called Thrive written by a vegan professional athlete named Brendan\nBrazier.\nSome of my friends specifically do things like convince people to try veganism for short\nperiods, or run Vegan Weeks at universities or whatever, just to show how (a) delicious\nand (b) easy vegan food can be. It works surprisingly well. A key ingredient in my own\nadoption of veganism was knowing vegans, and seeing how simple it was to be vegan. I\nused to push back really strongly... I think I resisted mostly because it was very hard to\nacknowledge that by eating animal products, I was participating in an incredibly fucked\nup system. First I had to recognize that I was doing something really bad, that I had been\ndoing so for my entire life, and that most people I love do it too. This is a familiar\nproblem for activists, of course; most people resist acknowledging that they participate in\na racist, sexist culture, too. (As one of my vegan friends puts it: \"I've found that people\nusually go through the strongest asshole anti-vegan phase right before they convert to\nveganism.\")\nOf all the social-justice acts out there, I actually think veganism is one of the lowesthanging\nfruit. It's just so easy that the only reason non-vegan culture can possibly persist\nis through a really high degree of not giving a shit. In a way, that's understandable; I don't\nhave much of a connection to animals myself. A lot of my vegan friends love animals and\nwant to be around them all the time; I don't. If a smelly dog never jumps on me again, it\nwill be too soon. But the fact is, animals have senses and feelings. Interacting with any\nanimal for longer than thirty seconds can conclusively show you that animals like and\ndislike things, and that they feel something that looks exactly like pain. Which brings me\nto....\n2. If you care about consent, then veganism is transparently the right thing to do. There\nare environmental arguments and stuff, but I mean, seriously, let's call a spade a spade:\nwhen you eat meat, you're eating the murdered body of an animal who died for no reason\nother than your transient pleasure. As for animal products: many things that happen to\nanimals on factory farms are abominable and obscene, as two minutes of Googling or this\nwebsite or this video can show you.\nEven if you decide to eat animal products that come only from well-treated animals,\nthere's no way to be sure that those animals were actually well-treated unless you're\nraising them yourself. As this vegan FAQ points out, there's an amazing amount of\nanimal suffering that still occurs on \"humane\" farms. (Salon has written about it, too.)\nSome of those farms are doubtless fairly pleasant for the animals, but others.... Well, let's\njust say that calling some \"humane\" farms more merciful than factory farms is like saying\nthat being burned alive is preferable to dying in a medieval torture device.\nPersonally, when I went vegan, a lot of the reason it felt easy was because I no longer had\nto spend tons of mental energy suppressing my empathy. I was amazed at how relieved I\nfelt. Again, I'm not pretending to be perfect about it -- I eat non-vegan food sometimes in\nsocial situations, sometimes when it's about to be thrown away, and sometimes just when\nI'm drunk. If you need to make accommodations in order to feel comfortable being\nvegan, then I'm the last person who will criticize you. I'll just be glad you're taking steps\ntowards being vegan.\nIt took me a long time to decide to go vegan, and I understand that it might take you a\nlong time, too. I've listed a lot of resources in this post and I hope you'll consider looking\nat them. Questions are welcome in the comments, although I may not be able to answer\nthem. I wish you luck. And if you're already vegan, then congratulations and high-5!\nNow for recipes!\nI promise that these recipes are beloved by non-vegans as well as vegans. In fact, even\nwhen I wasn't vegan, they were some of my favorites. When I feed these dishes to nonvegans,\nthey are frequently startled that the food isn't vegan. (Sometimes I save the Big\nReveal for last. Heh, heh.)\n(One of my other favorite gentle pro-vegan tactics is to walk into restaurants and ask if\nthey have anything vegan on the menu. When the answer is no, I smile and thank them\nand leave.)\nOrganic and fair-trade ingredients are obviously encouraged. I'm not as good about\norganic and fair-trade as I could be, mostly because of expense, but I try to do it when I\ncan.\nKickass Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies\nThis is a modified version of a recipe that I originally found here, and some of the text\ncomes from that recipe.\n+ 1 and 1/2 cups of FLOUR\n+ 1 teaspoon BAKING SODA\n+ 1 teaspoon SALT\n+ 3/4 cup of OIL\n+ 2 tablespoons COCONUT MILK (or ALMOND MILK or SOY MILK)\n+ 1 & 1/3 cups of UNREFINED SUGAR\n+ HALF A BANANA\n+ 1 1/2 tablespoons VANILLA EXTRACT (I've occasionally used RUM as a\nreplacement; when I do that, I like to add some CINNAMON)\n+ 2 1/2 cups OATMEAL\n+ 12 oz. of DARK CHOCOLATE CHIPS\nHeat your oven to 350 degrees.\nMix FLOUR, BAKING SODA and SALT together. Set aside.\nMix together the OIL and SUGAR. Mix until creamy. Thoroughly mash the BANANA\ninto the mixture.\nAdd the COCONUT MILK.\nAdd the VANILLA.\nStir this mixture until it is a uniform color (this will not take long).\nSlowly stir in the FLOUR mixture. Mix this well.\nStir in OATMEAL and CHOCOLATE-CHIPS.\nPreheat oven to baking temperature (usually 350 F).\nPlace large tablespoons full of the batter onto an ungreased cookie sheet (an air filled\ncookie sheet works best, as the air between the two layers of the sheet keeps the bottom\nof baked items from burning).\nBake the cookies for about 9 to 13 minutes (ovens vary in temperature). Check them by\ngently pressing on the top of one of the cookies. If the inside looks moist, but not too wet,\nthey are probably done. It might take you a couple of tries to get the time down, so bake\nonly a few at a time when starting out. Do not, I repeat, do not expect to see them turn\nslightly brown when done cooking. Without real eggs, they will not get that dark. They\nwill, however, turn a golden tan.\nWhen they are done, remove them from the oven and allow them to sit on the sheet for\nabout a minute or two before placing them on a wire rack. Be careful with them as they\ntend to be quite delicate until they have cooled.\nKickass Chocolate Cake\nI think I modified this recipe from an Internet source too, but I can't find it now.\n+ 1 1/2 cups FLOUR\n+ 1 cup SUGAR\n+ 1/2 cup UNSWEETENED COCOA\n+ 1 tablespoon GROUND CLOVES\n+ 1 teaspoon BAKING SODA\n+ 1 teaspoon CAYENNE PEPPER\n+ 1/4 teaspoon SALT\n+ 1 cup ALMOND MILK (or COLD WATER)\n+ 1/4 cup OIL\n+ 1 tablespoon BALSAMIC VINEGAR\n+ 1 tablespoon VANILLA (once I replaced this with ORANGE EXTRACT and added\nsome CINNAMON, and the result was amazing)\nPreheat oven to baking temperature.\nIn a bowl beat together the OIL, SUGAR, SALT, SPICES and COCOA until wellcombined.\nAdd the remaining ingredients, and stir until well-combined. Pour into a\ngreased enamel plate or cake dish and bake 20-30 minutes. Don't worry if the batter tastes\nquite spicy -- it mellows out a lot, when you bake it so that the end result is more\nchocolate with a spicy after-taste. Cool.\nThen mix the following ingredients together, and pour the resultant icing on top:\n+ 1 cup POWDERED SUGAR\n+ 1/2 cup UNSWEETENED COCOA\n+ 6 tablespoons COCONUT MILK (or ALMOND MILK or SOY MILK)\nTofu Tikka Masala\nThis is a modified recipe that originated with a friend.\n+ 5 tablespoons OIL\n+ 2 medium ONIONS, thinly sliced\n+ 5 large GARLIC CLOVES, finely chopped\n+ 2 BAY LEAVES\n+ 1 inch fresh GINGER, finely chopped\n+ 1/2 inch CINNAMON STICK\n+ 4 CLOVES\n+ 4 PEPPERCORNS\n+ 1 CARDAMOM POD\n+ 2 pounds TOFU\n+ 1 tablespoon GROUND CORIANDER\n+ 1 teaspoon GARAM MASALA\n+ 1 teaspoon GROUND CUMIN\n+ 1/2 teaspoon CAYENNE PEPPER\n+ 1/2 teaspoon GROUND TURMERIC\n+ 14 ounces CANNED TOMATOES\n+ SALT to taste\n+ 2/3 cup SOY YOGURT\nHeat OIL in large, heavy-bottomed sauce pan.\nAdd ONIONS, GARLIC, GINGER, BAY LEAVES, and WHOLE SPICES; fry gently on\nmedium heat until sauteed.\nAdd the TOFU, and fry until the pieces are lightly golden brown on all sides. (Here are\nsome tips on frying tofu so it has a light crust.)\nStir in CORIANDER, GARAM MASALA, CUMIN, CAYENNE, TURMERIC,\nTOMATOES, and SALT. Cook for a while (10 minutes works).\nAdd SOY YOGURT and cook for another while.\nAs a general rule, the longer you cook a spicy dish like this, the spicier it'll be.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/05/14/food-justice-confections-of-a-pickup-artistchaser/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nPOLYAMORY:\n[theory] In Praise of Monogamy\nThis post was published in mid-2011, and it got more attention than most things I've\nwritten. The reaction was quite mixed. Some monogamists felt that I was damning\nmonogamy with faint praise. Some polyamorists felt that it was problematic for me to\nwrite a post praising the culturally dominant Western mode of sexuality, because it's\nalready dominant. On the other hand, the piece was cross-posted at a number of highprofile\nwebsites, and I got a lot of positive commentary too.\nMy favorite comments came from Pepper Mint, a polyamory advocate who commented\non this post when it was cross-posted at Feministe. I really felt like Pepper got what I\nwas trying to do. Here's an excerpt from one of his comments:\n\"Monogamy is [perceived as] a hegemonic requirement, not an option that should be\nadvocated. So when people espouse monogamy (which is rare, since it is hegemonic),\nthey do it by claiming that anything else is impossible or they do it by making moral\nstatements. I challenge you to find a mainstream article that actually lists out the\npragmatic benefits of monogamy, like Clarisse has done here. I don't think I've ever seen\none. Indeed, when monogamy is explicitly discussed in the mainstream currently, it often\nseems to be in 'is monogamy realistic?' articles.\n\"Note that this is all to the detriment of monogamous people as well as nonmonogamous\npeople. When I talk to people about polyamory, I get a lot of defensive responses, for the\nsimple reason that monogamous people are often monogamous because they did not\nknow there was a choice, rather than monogamous by inclination or what have you.\nDiscourse that presents monogamy as an actual choice and lists out the pros and cons of\nthat choice is nonmonogamy-affirming in my book, unless it is hugely one-sided.\n\"We have a problem in the poly communities I engage in, where people new to\npolyamory spend a couple years unfairly trashing monogamy. This is partly out of anger\nfrom their history and partly because they've finally found what they are looking for and\neverything else looks shabby in comparison. But it creates ill-will where none need exist,\nit screws up people's approach to relationships, and it bites people later if they want to\ngo back to monogamy.\n\"So as a polyamory activist I'm very glad this essay was written, and I've posted similar\nthings myself in various forums. It addresses a hole in the discourse that is very\nimportant to fill.\"\nThanks, Pepper.\n* * *\nIn Praise of Monogamy\nThere are lots of different ways of approaching non-monogamous relationships, such as:\n+ Polyamory: Usually emphasizes developing full-on romantic relationships with more\nthan one partner. (I've been researching polyamory since my teens, but only in recent\nyears did I decide to actively pursue it.)\n+ Swinging: Usually emphasizes couples with their own close bond, who have relatively\ncasual sex with other partners. (Another difference between swinging and polyamory is\nthat swingers tend to be more at home in mainstream culture, whereas polyamorists tend\nto be geeky or otherwise \"alternative.\" The blog Polyamory In The News has a great, long\npiece on poly culture vs. swing culture.)\n+ Cheating: One partner does something with an outside partner that wasn't accepted or\nunderstood in advance. In monogamous relationships, cheating usually involves having\nsex with an outside partner. Cheating exists in polyamorous or swing relationships as\nwell: for example, a person might cheat on a non-monogamous partner by breaking an\nagreement -- an agreement such as \"we don't have unprotected sex with other partners.\"\nJust in case it needs to be said: I never advocate cheating, ever. As for the first two, I\nknow both poly people and swingers that I consider totally decent and wonderful folks! I\nhave more personal experience with and interest in polyamory, though.\nYet one thing that often gets lost in conversations about all these options is the\nadvantages of monogamy. Of which there are many. Although I don't currently identify\nas monogamous, I had a very strong monogamous preference for years. I knew that\npolyamory existed, and I thought about it a lot, because it's interesting -- but I just didn't\nfeel like it was for me. (In fact, my most adamantly polyamorous friend used to call me\nhis \"reasonable monogamous friend.\" He said I had examined polyamory enough to\nreasonably reject it, whereas he felt most people never consider polyamory deeply\nenough to have a thoughtful opinion.)\nAnd lately lots of my monogamous friends have been getting married. So I've been\nthinking about the positive aspects of their relationship choices as I dance at their\nweddings, devour mini-quiches, flirt with their brothers and try to avoid offending their\nparents. (Okay, I've actually only flirted with one brother. So far.)\nA Few Advantages of Monogamy (this is not a complete list)\n+ Jealousy management. Some people experience jealousy more than, or less than, or\ndifferently from other people. Plenty of people in non-monogamous relationships\nexperience jealousy -- and plenty of non-monogamous people handle it just fine, through\nopen-hearted communication. (Often, jealousy is managed through very detailed\nrelationship agreements such as a \"relationship contract.\")\nBut there are also plenty of people who appear to lack the \"jealousy chip.\"\nAnd then there are plenty of people who experience so much jealousy, who feel that\njealousy is such a big part of their emotional makeup, that the best way to manage it is\nsimply through monogamy.\nPersonally, I used to get a lot more jealous than I do now. I think I'm less likely to get\njealous these days partly because I've gotten better at finding low-drama men. Jealousy\nhas a reputation for being an irrational emotion, and sometimes it genuinely is an\nunreasonable, cruel power-grab. But I think jealousy is often quite rational, and often\narises in response to a genuine emotional threat... or deliberate manipulation.\nThere's another reason, though... I've also noticed that some switch in my brain has\nflipped, and I've started to eroticize jealousy. I occasionally find myself fantasizing about\nmen I care about sleeping with other women, and sometimes the fantasy is hot because I\nfeel mildly jealous. I cannot explain how this happened. It surprised me the first time it\nhappened, believe me. What's really fascinating is that I think the same part of me that\neroticizes jealousy, is the part that used to make me feel sick at the thought of my partner\nsleeping with someone else. Masochism: the gift that never stops giving!\nI think it's important to note here that I didn't become less jealous because I felt like I\n\"should\", or because I was told not to be jealous. In fact, I had an early boyfriend who\nacted like I was a hysterical bitch every time I got jealous... and he made things much\nworse. With him, I just felt awful when I got jealous; I couldn't get past it. I felt like he\nwas judging me for something I couldn't help; I felt like my mind was fragmenting as I\ntried to force myself to \"think better\" without any outside support; and worst of all, I felt\nlike I couldn't rely on him to respect my feelings.\nIt was the men who treated my emotions like they were reasonable and understandable\nwho decreased my jealousy. It's much harder to be jealous when your partner is saying, \"I\ntotally understand,\" than it is when your partner is saying, \"What the hell is the matter\nwith you?\" Maybe that's what makes monogamy such an effective jealousy-management\ntactic: monogamy can be like a great big sign or sticker or button you can give to your\npartner that says, \"I respect your jealousy.\" Which is not to say that monogamy is always\neffective for this -- we all know that monogamous people get jealous all the time! (Which\nonly adds to my point that monogamy might be viewed as just one of many tactics, rather\nthan an answer, when jealousy is a problem.)\n+ Focus. There's an oft-repeated joke among polyamorists that \"while love may be\ninfinite, time is not.\" And sometimes, I've found it a little difficult to \"switch gears\" to a\ndifferent partner. New Relationship Energy can be a little harder to manage in the\npolyamorous context than it is in serial monogamy.\nI've heard of polyamorous couples who specifically take periods of monogamy when one\npartner really wants one. This seems like it could be problematic -- for example, if my\nhypothetical primary partner wanted a period of monogamy, and I had a secondary\npartner (or partners) with a serious emotional connection, then I probably would not be\ncool with straight-up ignoring my secondary for weeks or months. There'd have to be\nmore of a conversation about it. But regardless, this whole line of thinking makes an\ninteresting showcase of how sometimes, people feel like they just have to focus on one\nrelationship.\nPersonally, I'm quite interested in S&M games of orgasm denial, though I've never had a\nchance to mess around with it as much as I'd like. I'm also interested in long-term lust\nmanagement strategies like karezza, where the partners involved choose not to have\norgasms -- instead, they maintain a low level of mutual arousal at all times. I have no\nmoral problem with my partners looking at porn or having orgasms on their own, but\nsometimes when I hear about the effects of choosing not to do those things, it sounds like\nthere's really powerful bonding potential there. Something to keep in mind for the next\ntime I'm really serious about someone, I guess. Monogamy isn't necessary for these\nthings, but it would definitely make doing them less complicated.\n+ Societal acceptance. Straight up, monogamy is the Western societal default. In some\nways this makes monogamy hard to understand and communicate about -- because there\nare so many assumptions and built-in expectations, and folks don't always agree on those\nexpectations! A recent study found that 40% of young couples don't agree about whether\nor not they're monogamous. That amazes me, because I have never assumed that I was\nmonogamous with a partner until we had a conversation establishing that we were\nmonogamous... but I guess I can see how it happens, if people feel anxious about\ncommunicating and fall back on assumptions instead.\nUsually, however, being the societal default makes monogamy easier. Heterosexual\nmonogamous people can get married with no problem, for example, and while marriage\nis obviously contested territory for non-hets, it's instructive that \"gay marriage\" is such a\nbig political issue (while \"polyamorous marriage\" is currently nothing more than a\nspecter right-wingers use to scare people about gay marriage). Outsiders usually assume\nthat you're monogamous when you introduce your partner. Romantic comedies exalt\nmonogamy; the media, and many people around us, associate monogamy with love.\nWhen you're monogamous, you never have to articulate your weird relationship structure\nto your parents. You rarely have to think outside the box about relationship problems, and\nyou can go to any Western advice columnist or therapist and be sure that they'll recognize\nyour relationship as legitimate. (Those of you who like privilege checklists might enjoy\nthis monogamous privilege checklist, which is patterned after Peggy McIntosh's classic\nessay and white privilege checklist.)\n+ Some people just like it better. Occasionally, people will toy with the idea of an\n\"orientational\" element to polyamory or monogamy: some folks just plain feel aligned\nwith monogamy or non-monogamy. (I have similar thoughts about this as I do about\nBDSM as a sexual orientation.)\nPersonally, I always think it's really key, during any sex-positive critique, to emphasize\nfrom the start that whatever you like is cool as long as the actions you take are\nconsensual. I know people who act all apologetic for being monogamous, usually because\nthey've been overexposed to \"polyvangelists\" who argue that non-monogamy is \"better\"\nor \"more evolved.\" This is silly! Liking monogamy doesn't have to be justified, as long as\nyou don't turn around and claim that non-monogamy is bad and wrong. And liking\nmonogamy is a perfectly awesome reason for preferring monogamy!\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/06/09/in-praise-of-monogamy/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nPOLYAMORY:\n[theory] My Top Questions About Dealing With Multiple Lovers\nI wrote this in early 2011. The comments on the online version are especially good -- lots\nof viewpoints and resources shared. Sometimes my commenters just blow me away.\n* * *\nMy Top Questions About Dealing With Multiple Lovers\nI have a lot more theoretical exposure to polyamory than personal experience, but I've\nbeen gaining more personal experience over the last year. It's often interesting, sometimes\npainful.\nSome recent experiences are making me think I am not nearly as smart or as on top of my\nemotions as I like to believe I am. I remind myself that I have to be willing to\nacknowledge when I don't know what I'm thinking, but that's harder than it looks... I don't\nalways take enough time to understand my feelings before speaking or acting.\nStill. Through the stupid mistakes and the understandable ones, though my own failures\nto be sensitive and the little heartbreaks I've sustained, I've been learning.\nOne thing I think I've figured out is what I want: I want a number of different\nrelationships that are ongoing, and one or two relationships that are primary, or especially\ncommitted. Ideally, in fact, I'd love to eventually have a permanent relationship with a\nprimary polyamorous partner in which we have kids with each other, live together most\nof the time, etc, but are still polyamorous. That would be a while in the future, though --\nfor now, it's important to me to not feel as though my partners expect me to settle down\nor stay in one place or anything like that. It seems like any relationship I develop, even\nduring this relatively early time in my life, could become a child-rearing relationship\neventually -- like, years from now -- but if it does, I doubt I'd want to make it\nmonogamous.\nI recognize that we don't always get our ideal world. In fact, we usually don't. Although\npolyamory is a high priority for me, it may be something I eventually compromise on,\ngiven that the majority of people in this world identify as monogamous.\nKeeping all that in mind, my preference for polyamory presents some challenges, and\nquestions that I worry about. Such as:\n1. What are my responsibilities towards my partners' other partners? A lot of poly\npeople will tell you that if you get into a relationship with, say, a married polyamorous\nman, then you must also expect to interact with his spouse. In other words, don't assume\nthat your relationship means you only interact with one half of a couple. I'm totally fine\nwith this, but on occasion I've felt like I was getting sucked into the couple's problems, or\nlike I was expected to have no individual relationship with my partner -- that I always had\nto go through his primary partner.\nYes, it is certainly my responsibility to communicate with my partners' other partners and\nto be friendly with them. But I need to set boundaries on that too -- just dating a poly guy\ndoes not make me their relationship therapist, and it doesn't make me best friends with\nhis other girlfriends (or boyfriends, for that matter). I am responsible for what I do, but\nI'm not responsible for what he does. I am responsible for how I treat his spouse, but I\ncan't be responsible for how he treats his spouse.\nBut what if I'm already friends with someone, and one of my partners gets involved with\nthat person? Do I have special responsibilities in that case? I'm still figuring that one out.\n2. When is it actually the best time to start talking about polyamory and setting out\nrelationship definitions? My approach so far has been to put poly on the table during\ninitial conversations, and then talk about it more when the topic of the relationship comes\nup. But I've been thinking lately that I probably should go into more detail sooner,\nbecause people have such different stereotypes of open relationships that I can't be sure\nthey're on board with what I'm talking about unless we've discussed polyamory in-depth.\nI feel like I talk to a lot of people who think they want a supposedly \"polyamorous\"\nrelationship because they see it as a no-strings-attached free-for-all, and that's definitely\nnot what I want. Or I talk to people who back away from polyamory for the same reason.\nI see polyamory as being about more commitment to relationship negotiation, not less. I\nsee it as being about setting individual boundaries, if necessary -- it's not about having no\nboundaries. I see it as being about creating a secure situation for all parties involved --\nnot making anyone insecure, or ignoring anyone's needs. And being polyamorous doesn't\nmake my relationships unimportant to me. Being in love doesn't seem at odds with\npolyamory for me.\nThis is a hard thing to communicate in a small dose, though, especially if I'm dealing\nwith someone who has minimal exposure to the concept. On the other hand, having a\nSerious Conversation about polyamory on the first date is a bit much.\n3. Is it a good idea for me to get involved with guys who ultimately want\nmonogamy? As I noted earlier, I might compromise to monogamy eventually, but poly is\na priority for me. (Who knows, maybe I'll decide it's my ideal relationship formation\nagain someday. This seems unlikely to me right now, but anything's possible.)\nBut what if I get really into a guy who ultimately plans to be monogamous? Is this a bad\ncall on my part? On the one hand, if I go on a few dates with a 28-year-old guy who\ndoesn't want to get married until his mid-30s but definitely wants a monogamous\nmarriage when he does... I mean, why not have a relationship? On the other hand, I may\nbe setting myself up for heartbreak in such situations, if he basically sees our relationship\nas \"not real\" from the start. This brings me to my next point....\n4. Some people see polyamory as a sign of commitment-phobia. I've made this\nmistake myself -- in fact, the \"polyamory as commitment-phobia\" stereotype is so strong\nthat I've occasionally reversed it and wondered if my desire for it was a sign of\ncommitment-phobia. But the fact is, my appreciation for polyamory only increased as I\nbecame more certain about what I'm seeking in a partner, and as I gained more\nunderstanding of how to negotiate that. It's come along with relationship confidence and\nunderstanding.\nI feel pretty okay with believing in commitment in the context of polyamory. But my\npotential partners might not be. I already tend towards emotional caginess and am\nsometimes accused of being way too emotionally controlled -- I'm worried that I'll be\nread as a \"player\" (or a \"slut\") by people who write me off as a result. I'm also worried\nthat some may be attracted to me because they see me as an emotionless player, whether\nthey admit it or not -- indeed, even if they don't admit it to themselves -- and will be\nannoyed if I turn out not to be that way. Stereotypes and assumptions are tricky to root\nout whether we're aware of them or not.\nSome days, I get nervous that the guys who are going to be willing to talk about and\nprocess relationships in the depth that I'm looking for, with a degree of acknowledged\nemotional commitment, are all monogamous. Then I remind myself of how many\nawesome polyamorous men I know, and also that I'm falling for stereotypes yet again,\njust by having these fears.\n5. Other questions:\nHow open am I to casual relationships that don't seem to be going in an emotional\ndirection, given that I don't have to give up on more serious relationships to have them?\nHow does being poly change breakup dynamics?\nIn the absence of monogamy, are there different signifiers that a relationship is serious --\nor is getting serious? How can I get better at both giving and reading those signifiers?\nWhat are the other poly stereotypes I've internalized, and how do I act against them?\nWhat are the other poly stereotypes I should look out for from others?\n6. Sigh.\nRereading all my questions and rethinking all my thoughts makes me feel somewhat\nexhausted. Relationships are hard, and hacking the expected models makes them\nhopefully more fulfilling... but also so much more complicated. My life seems so weird\nsometimes; a week doesn't go by that I don't wonder why I'm not getting a nice typical\njob and settling down with a white picket fence and the monogamous husband and having\n2.5 kids. That is not actually what I want, but sometimes the image seems seductively\neasy.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/04/11/my-top-questions-about-dealing-with-multiplelovers/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nSEX WORK:\n[storytime] One Blurred Edge of Sex Work: Portrait of a Sugar Baby\nI published this interview in January 2012 at the gender-lens website RoleReboot.org,\nwhere I had just taken on the role of Sex + Relationships Section Editor. Olivia left the\nbusiness in mid-2012, as you can read in the piece that follows this one.\n* * *\nOne Blurred Edge of Sex Work: Portrait of a Sugar Baby\nSex work is a controversial and polarized topic, and there are many perspectives on it.\nMy position is complex -- but for me, when it comes to how we actually interact with sex\nworkers, one important factor is whether or not they consent to and enjoy their jobs. I am\nabsolutely in favor of giving better options to sex workers who do not enjoy their jobs,\nand I am horrified by the idea of a person being trafficked or coerced into sex that they\ndon't want to have. But I also know people who have sex for money 100% voluntarily,\nand I do not want to deny their experience.\nMy friend Olivia, a 25-year-old graduate student, recently started advertising her services\non a \"Sugar Baby\" site called SeekingArrangement.com. I think it's important for more\npeople to understand these kinds of experiences, so I asked to interview her. Many people\nhave pointed out that once a person starts thinking about the definition of \"prostitute,\" it's\na bit difficult to define what exactly a prostitute is. Some of my sex worker friends have\nasked the question: what exactly is the difference between a person whose partner buys\nher a fancy dinner after which they have sex -- and a person whose partner buys sex with\nmoney? Olivia has thought at length about this, and I'm grateful to her for sharing her\nperspective on that question, and others.\nPlease note that Olivia is exceptionally privileged. What you are about to read is a\nportrait of what the sex industry looks like for a person who is very privileged: she comes\nfrom a white upper-middle-class background, she is not desperate, she is being paid a lot\nof money, she does not have a drug addiction. Many other peoples' experiences in the sex\nindustry are very different.\nClarisse Thorn: Hey Olivia, thanks so much for being willing to talk about this\nincredibly complicated topic. Could you start by defining a sugar baby site? What is\nit?\nOlivia: I use the site SeekingArrangement.com. I don't actually know how many sugar\nbaby sites there are, but I get the sense there's more than one. It's very hard to pin down\nexactly what it does. I guess it connects people, usually with a big age gap, who are\ninterested in exchanging some kind of material goods or financial resources for some\nform of companionship that is often sexual -- but not always.\nAs far as I can tell, the site's founder is very against the claim that this is prostitution. He\nputs out a lot of publicity claiming that this site has nothing to do with prostitution. At\nfirst I thought that he was trying to evade legal consequences, but I think he actually\nprobably believes that. The site has a blog that he controls, and you can look at it to get a\nsense of what he's thinking. One post I think is really interesting is called \"Sugar Baby &\nSugar Daddy: The Modern Day Princess & Prince?\", which compares being a sugar baby\nto a kind of \"happily ever after\" princess fantasy.\nSo far, no one I've talked to seems remotely interested in hiring what they see as a\n\"prostitute.\" They seem to want to be having sex with someone they find very attractive\nwho is also someone they feel like they can respect, whose intelligence they respect. For\nexample, someone I see occasionally -- the last time I saw him, he gave me money at the\nend and he said that he felt good about giving me the money because he knew I wouldn't\nspend it on, quote, \"a designer handbag.\" He seems to think that I am reasonably\nambitious and have my shit together, and he seems to feel more comfortable giving me\nmoney because he knows it goes towards my grad school costs and credit card debt. My\nability to write with proper grammar, without overusing emoticons, appears to be my\nbiggest sales point. Men have told me this outright.\nThat guy also mentioned feeling more comfortable because he thinks I'm from the same\nsocial class as he is. There are a lot of class issues coming up in these encounters, I think.\nBeing white and from an upper-middle-class background may help me get clients. My\nbackground has also given me a ton of confidence that puts me at an advantage when\nnegotiating. I do not think I radiate \"take advantage of me,\" and I (nicely) tell guys who\nstart doing that to go away.\nThe guy I was just talking about -- he also mentioned that he feels like he doesn't want to\nhave sex with someone that he doesn't feel at least a little bit connected to. There's a\ndistinction between meaningless sex and casual sex. I think these guys want casual sex --\nmaybe they aren't at the point where they want to deal with having a partner, or they're\nreally busy at work, or they already have another partner -- they want casual sex but not\nmeaningless sex.\nIn my encounters with these men, the money does two things. Firstly, it enables them to\nhave a relationship with me that they wouldn't otherwise be able to have. Secondly, it\nputs them in this position where they can give me something valuable and have that be\nappreciated. The guys I see really want to feel appreciated.\nClarisse Thorn: Do you feel like this has given you any new insight into gender\nroles?\nOlivia: Hmm.... It's made me feel more powerful. I definitely feel like I am the one with\nthe power in this situation. When I show up, I don't feel like -- here is this rich, powerful\nperson who is about to bestow wealth upon me. I feel like -- here is this person who is a\nbit sad and lonely, and maybe I can make their day better.\nA lot of the men who are on this site want to feel appreciated, so it's important to them\nthat the woman they're with give off the appearance of appreciating them. So for\nexample, on the website there's a lot of talk about sugar daddies being \"mentors\" or\n\"benefactors\" rather than clients. They seem to want some combination of me asking\nthem about their day, and they also want to feel like they're bestowing knowledge upon\nme about the world. One of the men I see will always talk about his opinions about\nmoney. He has complicated feelings about himself having money because he doesn't\ncome from money, so he's trying to work those out. But he also keeps telling me in a very\nserious voice that money will not make me happy, that nothing I can buy will make me\nhappy. I tell him that I can buy security and he says yes, that is one thing I can buy.\nOther men seem to be having issues with their age. One mentioned that he's just turned\n40, and that's really bugging him. Then he flaked out on me a couple times -- I don't think\nhe was completely okay with his own decision to be seeing me. But anyway, often,\nanother thing these men seem to get out of it is access to someone who has a bunch of\nyouthful energy and optimism and just plain new ideas. A lot of them have mentioned\nfeeling stuck, or bored, or cynical, or intellectually constrained. So in this sense sex is\nonly one thing I'm offering them -- I'm also offering them optimism, hope, energy, and so\non. Firstly, the sex is good in and of itself, as most of them aren't getting laid otherwise.\nBut the sex is also a symbol of them getting access to my youthful energy or whatever.\nI think the archetypal image of a mistress involves a woman being \"kept\" so that she\ndoesn't have to work, so that she can be available for sex basically whenever. But I don't\nthink this is what the men I see want. I am more valuable to them because I have other\nwork that I am seriously invested in, and am having sex with them anyway. Again, these\nmen are interested in a woman who they see as more \"equal\" to them -- in this case,\ndefined by earnings potential -- and they seem gratified by the idea that they could help\nme enter their income bracket someday. This is, of course, still kind of patronizing; like I\nsaid, they keep using words like \"mentor.\" It's also presumptuous. But I think a lot of\nthem being patronizing and presumptuous can probably be attributed to age and wealth,\nand only some of it to gender.\nI think I've learned more about class and money than I have about gender. It turns out\nthere are people to whom $1,000 versus $3,000 doesn't matter that much, and I finally\nunderstand that on a visceral level. $1,000 doesn't mean the same thing to me as it does to\nmost of them. I knew this, but now I really know it.\nAnother thing I've been struck by is exactly how much romantic relationships are worth.\nI've had several clients tell me they don't feel wealthy, and they feel like they worry about\nmoney a lot. I think they were sincere. Of course, my first thought was: don't you think\nthat your $2,000-per-month prostitute is part of the budget that could be trimmed? But I\nthink that maybe it's not, actually. I think they think that investing a lot of money in me is\na good investment for them if it gives them a release valve so they can deal with the rest\nof their lives. They're probably right.\nClarisse Thorn: You mentioned that you feel powerful in your relationships with\nthese men. But there are issues of your safety, right?\nOlivia: I think there are issues of safety anytime a person meets someone they don't really\nknow, especially if they plan to spend time in private. And especially if you're dealing\nwith topics as sensitive as sex or money. There may be more issues of safety with this\nbecause some people really do believe that money can buy them anything. But for the\nmost part, when I meet people they seem very respectful.\nThings I do to increase my safety are that I tell my husband and my friends where I'm\ngoing to be, I tell them exactly where I am. I'll do things like take down a client's license\nplate number and text it to my husband. I've been thinking maybe I should look at each\nclient's driver's license too, and text the client's name and driver's license number to my\nhusband. I think some clients might feel threatened by that, though.\nThe most important thing for my safety is that I'm willing and able to walk away from\nsituations. I'm not desperate -- I won't starve or die if I don't do this work. I meet all my\nclients in public first for a meal, and if someone sketches me out, I leave. I'm not so\ndesperate that I'll get into a situation that scares me.\nI guess I am at risk if I meet a really crazy person who wants to chop me up and put me in\na dumpster. But I could meet a person like that during a normal night at a bar, too.\nThe major risks that I see include that I might catch an STD -- but I use protection. I\nmight end up alone with someone who believes that the money he's paying actually gives\nhim the entitlement to do whatever he wants to my body, but I've never encountered\nanyone like that. The thing is, as I said before, I haven't met anyone who I think would\nactually describe themselves as paying for sex. The terms on which I continue to see\nthese men are probably less explicitly negotiated than an escort's terms would be. I don't\nhave flat rates, for example.\nI've heard escorts complaining that people who use sugar baby sites are unprofessional,\nand I think that from an escort's perspective they probably are.\nClarisse Thorn: If people are unwilling to actually talk about sex for money, it must\nbe hard to negotiate your encounters. Do you have a set of steps for negotiation?\nOlivia: I haven't been doing this for very long. It's varied so far. Usually, I meet them for\nsome kind of meal, and we chat. We have a perfunctory conversation, like -- \"How was\nyour day?\" Then one of us will say something like, \"Tell me a bit more about what you're\nlooking for. Why are you on the site?\"\nThen we'll explain our deal to each other. Like, he might say: \"I'm divorced, I'm looking\nfor companionship.\" At some point, money comes up. I am always extremely vague\nwhen I talk about money. I've found a good deal of variation in how squeamish people\nare about money.\nFor example, one client was saying that he wanted to get married again, but not yet. I\nsaid, \"Huh, well, if you're interested in a more emotional relationship, how do you feel\nabout involving money?\" The way he explained it to me was that people are attracted to\neach other for all kinds of reasons, probably including money, so why not be up front\nabout the fact that money is attractive. He seemed almost confused about why I asked.\nWith that guy, I ended up sleeping with him before we even talked about money -- which\nwas a huge risk, but I thought it might work, and it did. We had the money conversation\nimmediately after we had sex -- at some point when we were taking a break, I asked what\nhe was looking for more specifically from this relationship, and he said that he wanted to\nsee me again, maybe once a week. I think I asked him his preference for a monthly\nallowance as opposed to every time we meet, and he said he'd rather do something\nmonthly. Then when we were getting dressed, he pulled out $1,000 cash and handed it to\nme, and said, \"I'll give you the balance next time we see each other.\"\nWith other people I can be more straightforward. Maybe they aren't sure how to set up\nthe relationship, so maybe I talk about another client, like: \"I have another client I see 3\ntimes per month for $3,000,\" and they might say, \"That sounds good.\" But some guys\nwill just negotiate it per encounter. One guy brought it up very quickly after we'd\nexchanged some emails. He said that he prefers to do a \"per meet\" of $300 -- he called it\na \"per meet\" -- I told him that was too low and quoted him $1,000, and he said he'd meet\nme in the middle. Another guy told me that he would just slip $400 into my purse when\nhe saw me, and that's exactly what he did.\nI have one client I've never explicitly discussed money with at all. I had lunch with him,\nand we didn't negotiate anything, though we talked a little bit about our reasons for being\non the site. The next time I saw him -- we were deciding where to meet, and he asked if\nhe should get us a room. I said that I would like that, so I met him and we had sex. He\nknew it was my birthday soon, so as we were getting dressed, he said, \"I know we haven't\ntalked about money, so I got you some birthday spending money,\" and he handed me an\nenvelope with $400. The next time I saw him, he asked about my plans for the evening. I\nsaid I was having dinner with a friend, and he handed me $400 in an envelope and said,\n\"Maybe this will help pay for it.\" I'm lucky that I'm willing to accept $400 -- it's my\nlower bound, but I'm willing to accept it. Imagine if I hadn't been willing to take $400 --\nthat would be super awkward. Probably I should have negotiated that situation more\nclearly, but it worked out okay.\nI've heard about situations where unclear negotiations did not work out okay. There was a\nNew York Times Magazine article about the site published in 2009. In that article, there\nwere some examples of unclear negotiations that didn't work out well. But it sounded like\nthat woman didn't really know what she wanted, and didn't really enjoy the work. But I\ndo. And I know other women who do, too.\nI have a new client who paid me $3,000 up front to see me 3 times a month. But I haven't\nheard from him since our first meeting. If I were his girlfriend, I'd call him, but he asked\nme not to call him. So I don't really know what the deal with that one is. Maybe he's\ngonna flake out on me, but he already gave me $3,000, so that would be weird.\nClarisse Thorn: So, your husband. You mentioned him briefly. How does your\nhusband feel about this?\nOlivia: He does not seem particularly threatened. We already have an open relationship. I\nthink he sometimes feels very visceral jealousy, but that's just like any other time one of\nus has sex with somebody else. We just have to talk about it.\nPart of the deal here is that I'm doing this because I'm broke. My husband really wants to\nbe able to support me financially, but he can't right now, so I'm supporting both us doing\nthis. I think that's a real blow to his ego. To the extent that he gets bothered, I think it's\nbecause I'm allowing other men to support me and give me money; he doesn't care about\nthe sex. Even though I see this as work, he sees this as \"here's this rich successful guy\nwho just gave my wife a bunch of money, and she slept with him -- so probably she's\nattracted to him.\"\nI am kind of attracted to my clients, and I kind of get off on making them happy, and I\nhappen to think that the age difference is kind of hot. I like having sex with them; it's not\nunpleasant. I like hearing about these guys' life stories. I think it's interesting. But these\nguys would never be a threat to my husband. I would never be sleeping with any of them\nexcept for the money. And I love my husband. I'm always very up front about the fact\nthat I'm married and I love my husband. My clients accept that.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nand\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/01/05/one-blurred-edge-of-sex-work-interview-witha-sugar-baby-part-1/\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/01/09/one-blurred-edge-of-sex-work-interview-witha-sugar-baby-part-2/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nSEX WORK:\n[theory] A Sugar Baby Leaves The Business\nI published this in 2012; it continues Olivia's story. Thanks again to Olivia for being so\nincredibly generous with her time and her thoughts.\n* * *\nA Sugar Baby Leaves The Business\nPreviously on Role/Reboot, we ran an interview with my friend Olivia, a 25-year-old\ngraduate student who had just started having sex for money through a \"sugar baby\"\nwebsite called SeekingArrangement.com. In the interview, Olivia covered a lot of topics.\nShe mentioned that she usually feels powerful in her relationships with her clients. As she\nput it, \"When I show up, I don't feel like -- here is this rich, powerful person who is about\nto bestow wealth upon me. I feel like -- here is this person who is a bit sad and lonely,\nand maybe I can make their day better.\" Olivia also noted that her negotiations can be\ndelicate, because some men are quite squeamish while talking about money. And she\nexplained that she's married -- but it was already an open relationship, and she doesn't see\nhaving sex for money as different from the other kinds of sex that she and her husband\nwere already having with other people. To deal with it, they're sure to communicate\nclearly. As Olivia said, \"We just have to talk about it.\"\nIn the months since that interview, Olivia and I have hung out occasionally to talk about\nher experience with sex work. She's traveled across the city to meet me, and often bought\nme coffee; non-judgmental social support for sex workers can be rare, and I've seen more\nof her since she started the job. Although she really enjoyed the work at first, there were\ntough times too, especially after the novelty wore off. Recently, Olivia decided to stop\nseeing clients. We talked it through and she gave me permission to write about it. (She\nalso reviewed this article pre-publication.)\nObviously, there were logistical complexities from the beginning. Taxes were a\nnightmare. Olivia wanted to pay them, but it's not the easiest proposition. Then there was\nthe question of paying off her debts. Some were simple enough, but then there were loans\nco-signed by her parents, and there was no way she could make any headway on those\nloans without talking to her parents... so Olivia had to maintain the fiction that she\ncouldn't pay.\nThat was nothing compared to the complexities of feelings and communication, though.\nI've already shown you how hard it was, sometimes, for Olivia to talk about money with\nher clients. There are other, subtler problems that are hard to handle with empathy: for\nexample, creating the Girlfriend Experience persona.\nI've talked to sex workers who enjoy creating a \"sexy dreamgirl shell\" on behalf of their\nclients. One of them said to me: \"I create that persona for my boyfriends anyway. It's nice\nto be paid for it.\" But as a feminist sex writer who's spent years working to understand\nmy own sexual authenticity, this freaks me out a bit. I think it would feel terribly toxic\nand inauthentic for me.\nIt often felt inauthentic to Olivia, for sure, and that got harder and harder. \"These men are\nvery invested in believing that I'm super into this,\" she told me once. \"I have to keep up\nthe front, and make them feel like I'm interested all the time. It's literally my job to do\nthat. When they tell me how happy I am, or when they inform me that I'm enjoying\nmyself, I can't really contradict them, even if it's not true. Some of them use words like\n'magical' to describe me, but the person they're describing is not really me. Sometimes I\nthink these guys pay me because in a non-professional relationship, a woman might push\nback when he says those things. She might contradict his idea of her too much.\"\nIn fairness, Olivia naturally fits one glam stereotype of the middle-class sex worker: the\nsexually adventurous young student. It's such a widely-promoted stereotype that\nexperienced sex worker activists speak derisively about it, and some escorts lie and say\nthat they fit the profile when they don't. Presumably, clients enjoy believing that a girl is\na sexually adventurous college student because it capitalizes on images of \"sexy coeds\" --\nand convinces the client that she's not being emotionally harmed by the work. (I've often\nthought that it's way past time for \"fair trade prostitution,\" where sex trade ethics are\nmade into a competitive advantage. I've also thought that the most feminist thing I could\never do would be to open a brothel where all the sex workers are treated well. Too bad it's\nillegal.)\nOf course, SeekingArrangement.com actively encourages the idea that a \"real\nrelationship\" can emerge from these arrangements. (In our previous interview, Olivia\npointed out the SeekingArrangement blog post \"Sugar Baby & Sugar Daddy: The\nModern Day Princess & Prince?\" Another interesting one is called \"Sugar Babies Do Fall\nIn Love.\") While some guys on the site really do just want to pay for straight-up sex,\nsome become emotionally invested in the women whose company they buy. And we can\ntell from Olivia's experiences negotiating payment that a lot of guys don't like thinking\nabout how they're paying for it.\nBottom line: more than one of Olivia's clients were into her for real, and she felt more\nand more uncomfortable about it as time passed. One man took a surreptitious photo of\nher and hung it on the center of his otherwise-bare refrigerator. Another client made faux-\noffhand wistful comments such as, \"If you weren't already married, haha....\"\nOlivia asked my advice on one of these guys, who was clearly falling in love with her\nfrom the start. She mentioned that she'd already talked to another sex worker about it.\nThe other worker's reaction was, essentially, \"What problem?\" As Olivia put it: \"She told\nme that the guy is basically a locked-in regular now, so what am I so bothered about?\"\nBut after a while, Olivia couldn't take how guilty and anxious she felt around this guy,\nwhat with the feelings she couldn't return. She stopped responding to his messages, but\ndidn't tell him clearly that it was over because trying to phrase the email felt so awful.\n\"I was so unprofessional about it,\" she said. \"In the end, he sent me this incredibly sweet\nnote asking what he'd done to hurt me so badly. So my husband helped me write a 'it's not\nyou, it's me' breakup email. I still feel bad.\"\nAnother facet of emotional difficulty arose when Olivia's husband started taking a\nmedication that decreased his libido. This put the couple in the odd position of Olivia\nhaving sex with other men, but not her husband -- with her husband's full knowledge and\nconsent. Although her husband tried to reassure her, she began feeling less secure and\nstable at home. And sex work is stressful enough that home security can really, really\nmatter. Indeed, at one point Olivia mentioned: \"One of my friends is tempted to get into\nsex work. But she says she doesn't think she can deal with it, emotionally, unless she has\na partner at home who loves her and will back her up. So I'm not supposed to let her have\nsex for money until she's in a good solid relationship.\"\nFinally, as Olivia fielded other life stresses, she flatly realized that she couldn't have\nanything extra going on. What with all the above conversations, we saw signs that the\nchange was coming, but when it arrived it was both sudden and intense. \"One day I just\nknew I had to stop,\" she told me. \"It's bad, because we're behind on rent now, but I had to\nstop. My husband pointed out, gently, that we need the money. But of course he accepted\nit when I said I was done. Anyway, I managed to line up a good temp job, so we're okay\nfor now.\"\nI tried to show in the original interview that Olivia is very privileged compared to most\nsex workers. She's got race privilege for her whiteness, class privilege from her\nbackground; she's pretty and young and \"valuable,\" and has tons of education to boot.\nShe doesn't have a drug habit or some other truly debilitating issue. Although she's under\nsome financial stress, she's not desperate.\nAnd that leads me to this question:\nIf even a woman like Olivia -- who was well-treated and made a lot of money and didn't\nfeel trapped; whose life sounded like the glam fantasy of today's high-end call girl -- if\neven a woman like Olivia eventually needed a break from sex for money, then what\ncould this imply about the experience of less privileged women? I've got a bunch of sex\nworker friends, and I would never say that a woman can't be a 100% consenting adult sex\nworker who enjoys her job. But what I'm trying to get at, here, is that even on the \"high\nend,\" sex work can be incredibly demanding. Even when sex work is as pleasant as it\npossibly can be, it's often very hard.\nI'd like to see more conversations that acknowledge the reality of sex work as\nemotionally intense and challenging, a job that can be bad for many people at many times\nin their lives -- without letting go of the fact that some people can and do freely consent\nto the job. (The sex worker Mistress Matisse has written a fair bit on sex work and\nemotional labor. And male sex workers don't always have an easy time; the porn star\nTyler Knight has written about some of his more difficult moments, too.)\nThe point is not \"sex work is bad and should be banned\" -- but nor is it \"sex work is\nglamorous and fun!\" The point is, sex work is often hard work, even for people who are\nnot mistreated or abused. As such, it deserves both respect (from outsiders) and openeyed\ncaution (from those who consider taking it up).\nOlivia's not sure she's done with sex work for good. \"The door is still open for future\ninvolvement,\" she told me, last time we met for coffee. \"If I do go back, I think I may try\nfor straight-up escorting, but I'm not really sure....\" Presumably, working as an escort\nrather than being a \"sugar baby\" might evade some of these confusing, strangelynegotiated\nsituations. Would it evade all of them? It's hard to say.\nRegardless, I wish her luck.\n* * *\nAfter June 1, 2012, this can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/06/01/a-sugar-baby-leaves-the-business/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nSection 2 Study Guide\nThis section was intended mostly to highlight various \"other\" perspectives that I feel are\nsignificant to sex and/or activism.\n* * *\n1.

Some were monogamous, some polyamorous. Some have been\non-and-off, some short-term, some long-term (5 or 6 years was the longest). Lately I've\nbeen processing some tough questions about polyamory, but I'd like to stick with it.\nAnd I've been thinking a lot about what I want in a primary polyamorous partner. The\nkind of guy I could marry. I wonder if I'll ever get to that point. I wonder if I'd know him\nif I saw him.\n* * *\nI met Mr. Ambition at one of the aforementioned weddings. Several people\nrecommended that I talk to him, and we liked each other right away. Mutual friends used\nwords like \"zealot\" to describe him; let's just say he's got an intense history of dedicated\nactivism. Charisma, integrity, and pure energy pour off him. His words are almost always\narticulate and challenging. He can socially dominate a room without thinking. He works a\nchallenging job ten hours per day; exercises two hours; socializes several hours; sleeps\nand eats when he can. He gives hugs easily, laughs easily, hands out compliments like\ncandy.\nMr. Ambition is most definitely not a neutral personality. Of course, neither am I.\nAt the time, I was just coming out of the worst stage of my research on pickup artists -- a\nsubculture of men who trade tips on how to seduce women. Also, I'd just had one of those\nbreakups where I was too busy feeling stupid to properly understand how hurt I was.\n(Don't you hate those?) You can read all about those Dramatic Events in my upcoming\nbook Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser. In the meantime, suffice to say that I felt...\nflattened.\nArguably, I should have had a sign taped to my forehead that read: \"Emotionally\nUnavailable.\"\nI went to dinner with Mr. Ambition later that week. At the end of the meal, he sat back\nand looked at me. \"You're so authentic,\" he said.\n\"I haven't felt very authentic lately,\" I said frankly, but his words felt good. Like a balm.\nLike I was healing.\n* * *\nWe got along excellently, had a lot in common, etc. Typical this-relationship-starts-well\nstuff. One evening, after we'd been out to eat in a big philosophical group, Mr. Ambition\nnoted the hotness of my intense theoretical bent. \"When you were discussing social\njustice and ethics tonight,\" he said, \"I wanted to reach across the table and grab you.\"\nHe mentioned marriage within weeks. \"This has never happened before,\" he told me.\n\"I've never dated someone I thought I could actually marry.\" Whoa, tiger, I thought, but I\nhad to admit that he hit a lot of my Ideal Characteristics as well. Intelligence, drive,\ncharisma, and morality: it's hard to argue with that.\nOur sexual chemistry was okay, but not climb-the-walls stellar. We'll develop that, I told\nmyself. He's less sexually experienced than I am, and we'll learn each other just fine.\nFortunately he's got some experience with polyamory, but in terms of S&M, he's another\nof those vanilla-but-questioning guys (I never learn). When we did S&M, I had to\nmonitor the situation extra carefully because it was so new to him.\nAnd for all his intelligence, it was really hard to talk to him about emotions. It wasn't that\nhe was cold or distant; on the contrary, he's one of the most fiery people I've ever met.\nBut he had a lot of difficulty explaining what was going on in his head. Indeed, he told\nme that he had a lot of difficulty knowing what was going on in his head. He did things\nlike laugh when a friend hurt his feelings, then deny that he was hurt, even though I could\nplainly see the stricken look behind his eyes.\nI wasn't surprised that he was more physical than verbal about S&M. Very\nstraightforward: throwing me around, pulling my head back, digging his hands into my\nskin. He's incredibly strong, and sometimes I called my safeword simply because his\nstrength scared me.\nThere was one particular S&M encounter... early in the evening, I called my safeword\nbecause I wasn't sure he was into it.\n\"Red,\" I said, and he stopped. \"Is this okay with you?\" I asked, and he nodded.\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"This is good. Let's keep going.\" His voice was low and slightly rough; a\nmarvel of certainty. He put his hands back on me instantly. My doubts disappeared.\nWe kept going. I watched my body, felt the lump building in my throat, monitored my\nbreath as it became harsh and fast.\n\"Red,\" I said, and he stopped. \"You're going to break me,\" I said, \"I'm going to cry. If\nyou don't want to deal with that, then stop.\"\nThis, by the way, is a difficult skill that I have learned: this ability to track my S&M\nreactions so clearly. I would never have been able to do it seven years ago, and I still can't\ndo it during complicated S&M encounters. But now I can do it during simple ones. (Yes,\n\"simple\" and \"complicated\" are in the eye of the beholder.)\nI really hate stopping an S&M encounter right when I'm on the verge of tears. It's worse\nthan an interrupted orgasm. But I'd rather do that than break down crying and then deal\nwith a horrified partner.\n\"That's fine,\" said Mr. Ambition. So we kept going. I cried. He started talking, and I was\nsurprised by how harsh his words could be. That's more like it, I thought.\nSome S&M encounters have a rhythm to them, a poetry: a beginning and an end that\nbecome clear to the participants as they go along. This one didn't -- at least not to me. So\nI didn't rely on him to bring it to a close. After a while, I safeworded out, and took a\nbreath to still my tears.\nMr. Ambition was quiet again. I was having trouble reading him. There was some energy\ncaught inside him, coiled like a dragon, but I couldn't tell if it was violence or something\nelse. I put a halt to my own emotional cycle and tried to focus on him. \"How are you\nfeeling?\" I asked, but he couldn't tell me. I asked a few more questions, and he just\ncouldn't answer. He just didn't know.\nI never got another word from him on how he felt about that encounter. I wondered if I\nwas being too careful in how I asked about it; I wondered if he wanted me to push harder;\nI wondered if I'd already pushed him too far.\nI suspected there were some dramatic feelings trapped in Mr. Ambition. But I wasn't sure\nI currently had the warmth to coax them out.\n* * *\nIn the past, I've fallen in love so hard that I felt like the world was black-and-white when\nI was away from my lover; I felt like I only saw color when I was with him. I have dated\nmen where the chemistry was so intense, so obvious, that it hung in the air between us\nlike smoke. I've had sex that felt like telepathy. It's pretty awesome when it works. And\nit's easier to get that with some people than with others: some guys, I meet them and it's\nlike we speak the same language already.\nWith some guys, it's not instant, but it also doesn't take long to build our mutual\nvocabulary.\nAnd then I've dated guys where the learning curve -- both sexually and temperamentally\n-- was much longer. It was less instinctive. But it was not impossible. So I know for a fact\nthat people can build chemistry. Sometimes it's just there, but sometimes you can create\nit.\nMy relationship with Mr. Ambition was definitely polyamorous, but a few weeks in, I\ndecided I was really into him... and I started managing my incentives. There was another\nguy I saw occasionally, with whom I had stronger instinctive chemistry. This other guy\nagreed with me that we didn't want a Big Important Relationship. This other guy will\nscrew up my incentives if I hang out with him too much, I thought, and I limited my time\nwith him. I set rules with myself: I didn't call him, I didn't text him. I knew: If I let myself\nget too intensely into this other guy, that could inhibit my ability to bond with Mr.\nAmbition.\nI told the other guy that once my relationship with Mr. Ambition was more stable, we\nmight be able to pursue something more intense. By the time we had the conversation, he\nsaid he'd already been thinking similar thoughts. That he didn't want to distract me from\nsomething that could be beautiful.\nSimilarly, there are one or two men in my life that I'm attracted to but don't want a sexual\nconnection with at all. So I try not to see them unless I feel inoculated: I don't hang out\nwith them unless I'm sure I can distract myself with my feelings about another man.\nA lot of polyamorists say that \"love is infinite,\" that we can love lots of people, etc. I\nagree with this in theory -- but there's also a polyamorous saying that \"While love may be\ninfinite, time is not.\" And hormones aren't infinite, either. I've learned my hormonal\nreactions, I've seen myself get imprinted by people... I've seen myself develop feelings\nand fantasies for one guy that made me 100% immune to another hot guy's charms.\nDo I have perfect self-control? Absolutely not. That's why I'm trying to influence my own\nchoices so carefully. I know that choice plays a huge role when we build relationships.\nChoosing to commit is arguably as big a relationship factor as instinctive chemistry.\n... Arguably.\n* * *\nWhen I first got to college many moons ago, my roommate came from a family of\nimmigrants with a tradition of arranged marriages. She and I stayed up late one night,\nperched on our dorm room mattresses, and I listened in fascination while she told me that\nher father wanted her to marry a man of her father's choice, rather than her own.\n\"I'm not sure whether I'll do it,\" she said. I watched her wave a hand airily. I was\nmesmerized by her casual acceptance of a custom that struck me as barbaric. \"I mean,\"\nshe said, \"I'm cool with this guy that my dad's found for me. But I don't know if we're\nthat cool. On the other hand, I can't deny the advantages of arranged marriages.\"\n\"Advantages!\" I cried. I was so young... (Okay, I'm still young.) \"What do you mean,\nadvantages?!\"\n\"Arranged marriages are more stable,\" she said. \"Much more stable. I'm not sure I'd ever\nwant to marry for love. That shit goes up in smoke.\"\nFrom what I understand, there have even been studies about this: that people in arranged\nmarriages report being quite happy, quite stable.\nI've gotten the it's-not-passion-that-makes-a-successful-marriage message before, of\ncourse -- often from super-white, super-American Americans. For example, there's that\ninfamous 2008 article \"Marry Him: The Case For Settling For Mr. Good Enough.\" The\narticle is sure to send any woman roughly my age into a panic. It's made enough of an\nimpression that I still have conversations about it with other women my age -- almost\nfour years after its debut.\nI don't like the Settling writer's attitude. She's written with horror and anger about S&M\nin other venues, for example; and the whole Settling article has a generally conservative\nbent. But she's articulating some real feelings and important thoughts, and while I don't\nagree with all of them, I do agree with some. At one point, analyzing television, she notes\nthat:\nWhile Rachel and her supposed soul mate, Ross, finally get together (for the umpteenth\ntime) in the finale of Friends, do we feel confident that she'll be happier with Ross than\nshe would have been had she settled down with Barry, the orthodontist, 10 years earlier?\nShe and Ross have passion but have never had long-term stability, and the fireworks she\nexperiences with him but not with Barry might actually turn out to be a liability, given\nhow many times their relationship has already gone up in flames. It's equally\nquestionable whether Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw, who cheated on her\nkindhearted and generous boyfriend, Aidan, only to end up with the more exciting but\nself-absorbed Mr. Big, will be better off in the framework of marriage and family. (Some\ntime after the breakup, when Carrie ran into Aidan on the street, he was carrying his\ninfant in a Baby Bjorn. Can anyone imagine Mr. Big walking around with a Bjorn?)\nI've never watched Friends or Sex and the City, but I know the feeling.\nPersonally, I'm more of a novel girl. The other day, I found myself thinking of my longago\nroommate and her thoughts on arranged marriage while I read Monica Ali's beautiful\nbook Brick Lane. Monica Ali is an immigrant to the United Kingdom, and the characters\nin her novel all come to the UK from Bangladesh. Some of the characters accept\ntraditional arranged marriages, while others make \"love marriages\" instead -- often\ndefying their parents, their whole set of cultural norms, to do so. Towards the end of the\nnovel, one man reflects on the early days of his marriage:\nWe thought that the love would never run out. It was like a magic rice sack that you\ncould keep scooping into and never get to the bottom. It was a \"love\" marriage, you see.\nWhat I did not know -- I was a young man -- is that there are two kinds of love. The kind\nthat starts off big and slowly wears away, that seems you can never use it up and then\none day is finished. And the kind that you don't notice at first, but which adds a little bit\nto itself every day, like an oyster makes a pearl, grain by grain, a jewel from the sand.\nAs you can tell, this character is currently unhappy in his \"love marriage.\" Of course, the\ngrass is always greener on the other side. What's the difference between the big love and\nthe pearl love? Can they even be compared? Is it like apples to oranges?\nBut couldn't all this be a false dichotomy? Who says it's about arrangement versus\nrandomness -- chemistry versus choice? Can we have both? Can we find the big love, and\nnurture that so it develops into the pearl love, too?\nMy ultimate conclusion about the Art and Science of Flirting, from my \"studies\" of\npickup artists and also my entire life, is that flirting is all about strategic ambiguity.\nDeliberate uncertainty. Manipulating ambiguity and uncertainty can contribute to many\nintense feelings.\nSome people learn this, and decide that the only way to have a relationship with\nchemistry is to include a constant generous dollop of uncertainty about love, loyalty, or\nsomething equally important. These people decide chemistry can only derive from little\npieces of confusion: tiny mismatches that lodge underneath the similarities that bring\npeople together, constantly unsettling, like a prickly burr. But I don't think that's what I\nwant.\nAnd after all, S&M creates extraordinary feelings too, but plenty of people do S&M in\nvery controlled circumstances: pre-discussed, with safewords and so on. Arguably, S&M\nis another form of mismatch, of contrast, of uncertainty -- but it's a form that can be\nmanaged. So I know all about creating intense uncertain feelings in controlled\ncircumstances, and using those to contribute to stable and reliable loving relationships.\nDon't I?\nEventually, my college roommate caused a gigantic blowup in her family by rejecting\narranged marriage. Her father didn't speak to her for a long, long time.\n* * *\nOn my birthday, Mr. Ambition took me out to dinner. Then we went to watch fireflies by\nthe lake. As was inevitable for summer in Chicago, we ran into lots of people we knew.\nOne of those groups contained an on-again-off-again partner of mine: Richard, with\nwhom I have... shall we say, a complicated history. I respect Richard a lot, and I like him,\nand I'm highly attracted to him... but I'm pathologically wary of him for reasons that will\nbecome obvious.\nWe greeted our friends. \"How are you doing?\" Richard asked.\n\"Happy birthday to me, asshole,\" I teased. \"How could you forget?\"\nRichard sighed. \"Jeez,\" he said, \"sorry I neglected to wish you a happy birthday within,\nlike, the first 15 seconds I saw you.\"\nI paused, and took a moment to recalibrate: he wasn't reacting in his usual adversarial,\nteasing-back manner. On the other hand, history has taught me not to fall for it when\nRichard seems unexpectedly vulnerable.\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. I kept my tone light-hearted, friendly. \"You know I love you, right?\"\n\"Do I?\" Richard asked.\nI tilted my head at him. Without thinking, I kissed my own fingers, then put my hand\ngently against his face, as if I were about to stroke his cheek. Or slap him. I guess it was a\nway of distancing myself and kissing him at the same time. I think he understood that I\nintended it as an uncertain-but-intimate gesture. But I'm never sure, with Richard.\n\"Call me,\" I said.\n\"No,\" Richard said. \"You call me.\"\nHours later, Mr. Ambition brought him up. We were having one of those sweet, intimate,\ndisjointed bedtime conversations. Mr. Ambition was lying back, half-covered by a sheet,\nand I was admiring the play of light on his chest. \"Richard really cares about you,\" he\nsaid.\nI stiffened, and sat up. \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But I can't trust Richard.\"\n\"His tone seemed wistful, when he saw you.\"\n\"I can't trust Richard,\" I repeated. \"It's always a game with him. Sometimes I think that\nwe have a real emotional connection, but if I try to talk about it or give him emotional\nfeedback, he just ignores me.\"\n\"Maybe he isn't really ignoring you,\" argued Mr. Ambition. \"Maybe every time you say\nsomething, or give a little, it makes a tiny bit of difference. Maybe you just have to stay\nopen. Keep trying. These things build up.\"\n\"You don't understand,\" I snapped. \"You don't know him! Maybe he really cares, but\neven if he does, it doesn't matter! Things always end up the same. If I mention emotions,\nor if I act warm to him, he'll ignore me for a while... and then he'll be cold to me again.\nI'm telling you, I've been here before, with Richard. It's a trap.\"\nMr. Ambition didn't waver. \"If you're strong enough,\" he said simply, \"then you can walk\ninto a trap.\"\nHis words made my heart crack, my breath catch. Made me feel like I've forgotten\neverything I knew about love.\nWhen I was younger, I thought of my emotional strength like water: an embrace that\ncould make someone I loved feel lighter. Water is a slow, eroding force that pulls beauty\nfrom the unexpected. Water makes wood into twisted driftwood sculptures; sharp glass\ninto opaque dim jewels; rocks into soft sand. Water will eventually reveal the heart of\neverything it touches. If you let it.\nI hadn't thought of myself that way in a long time. I felt like Mr. Ambition was calling\nme out, reminding me of who I wanted to be. Maybe I protect myself better, these days.\nBut vulnerability is not always a bad thing.\nI definitely could fall in love with this man, I realized.\n\"You're really amazing,\" I said, and threw myself on his chest.\nHe put his arms around me. \"So are you,\" he said.\n* * *\nAs a storyteller, I often look back on my relationships and pick out foreshadowing: the\nomens. And by now, I recognize the omens even as they're happening... and sometimes I\nchange my behavior, but usually I don't. Perhaps this state is what they call maturity.\nOne night while we were out, Mr. Ambition sighed in an offhand way. He seemed tired,\nout of sorts. \"I just want someone to take me on an emotional journey,\" he remarked to\nme. Then he added, \"... No offense.\"\nI mentioned this to a friend, later: \"Mr. Ambition says he wants me to take him on an\nemotional journey,\" I said.\n\"An 'emotional journey'? That shit gets old, though,\" said my friend. I laughed, and\nagreed with him.\nAnother night, Mr. Ambition mentioned something about enjoying drama. I was with my\nbest girlfriend at the time; she and I looked at each other. \"Careful what you wish for,\" I\nsaid.\nMy friend said, \"Yeah, I'm pretty sure Clarisse knows how to create arbitrary amounts of\ndrama at any time.\"\n\"But I'm pretty sure I don't want to,\" I said.\nLater, when Mr. Ambition mentioned that he doesn't usually know how he's feeling, he\nadded: \"My friends can often tell more about my own emotions than I can.\"\n\"So you basically outsource your emotional processing to your friends?\" I asked.\nHe agreed.\nPerhaps the worst omen was when Mr. Ambition told me, \"I've never been hurt by love.\"\n\"Never?\" I asked.\n\"Never,\" he said.\nHis certainty was so great that, in itself, it made me uneasy. Because I have definitely\nbeen hurt by love. And my greatest wounds were dealt by men who seemed sure they\nloved me. A man who seems sure might actually be sure, but he may simply fail to\nunderstand himself.... So these days, it's always men who seem certain that make me\nmost uncertain.\nThere's another great quotation from that Monica Ali novel, Brick Lane. Here it is: \"The\nthing about getting older is you don't need everything to be possible anymore, you just\nneed some things to be certain.\"\n* * *\nI often felt like I was watching the relationship from a distance. I tried to resist thinking\nof our relationship using cold, manipulative pickup artist terminology and tactics, but\nsometimes I couldn't stop myself. I'd rather not talk about that.\nI found more and more ways to manage my incentives. I noticed that one of my methods\nwas telling friends and parents that I liked Mr. Ambition a whole lot. I think it was even\ntrue.\nMost of all, I told myself that the lack of natural chemistry was a good thing, and not a\nbad thing; the lack of natural chemistry was why this relationship could last.\nI was quite calculating about it, really, and maybe that was why he broke up with me. On\nthe bright side, I kept my head during the breakup, which was nice, because I didn't keep\nmy head during my last breakup. With Mr. Ambition, I didn't feel like my self-control\nslipped at all.\n\"We need to talk,\" Mr. Ambition said without preamble, when I met him in the foyer of\nhis apartment building. \"I'm having some concerns about our relationship.\" Once we were\nin his apartment, he said, \"To be honest, I don't know how attracted I am to you.\"\nI tried to measure his mien. I got the feeling, again, that energy was coiled tightly inside\nhim. Like a dragon. \"Are you breaking up with me?\" I asked.\n\"We're just having a conversation,\" he said quickly.\nWe talked about sex for a while. Chemistry. \"I don't think I like S&M, to be honest,\" he\nsaid. \"I don't feel affected by it.\"\nI thought: Are you sure? and You definitely looked affected by it, but it's both unethical\nand unwise to question someone else's experience. So I just said, \"You know I don't want\nyou to do anything you don't want to do. Have you felt pressured by me?\"\n\"No, of course not,\" he said.\nWe talked some more. He ultimately said, \"Look, are you totally satisfied with the sex\nwe're having?\"\n\"I mean...\" I said. \"It's not the most intense sex I've ever had, but it'll keep getting better.\"\n\"I think we should just be friends,\" he said.\n\"... Okay,\" I said. \"Um. Is there anything else you want to talk about?\"\nMr. Ambition seemed agitated. He seemed barely able to hold still. \"I've never dated\nanyone that I respected like I respect you,\" he said. \"Your charisma, your intelligence,\nyour morality. But... I don't know. I don't feel like we're very authentic with each other. I\ndon't feel like there's much warmth between us.\"\nMaybe you're right, I thought. But either way, it's too late now. \"Okay,\" I said. I thought\nfor a moment. \"I'm sorry,\" I added. \"I really wanted this to work out.\" For a moment,\ntears startled my eyes, but I blinked them back.\n\"Are you all right?\" he asked. He leaned forward. \"Is there anything I can do for you?\"\nI looked at him and tried to think. I knew I was going to be very upset in maybe fifteen\nminutes. He seemed hurt, and I wanted to say something that would comfort him. I\nwondered if he wanted me to cry, and beg, and create drama; I wouldn't do that... but\nmaybe it would help if I asked for something simple.\nBut I couldn't come up with anything, and I wanted to leave. So after a pause, I said,\n\"You can let me go home and cry.\"\nI said it as gently as I could. But Mr. Ambition seemed terribly distressed. \"Ohhh,\" he\nsaid, and screwed up his face. He leapt to his feet. \"I'm sorry,\" he said.\n\"It's okay,\" I said. \"Is there anything else?\"\n\"Sometimes I think men just aren't capable of the kind of commitment women are,\" Mr.\nAmbition said. He sounded defensive, even though I hadn't made any accusations. \"Then\nagain, you're not like most women.... You're kind of a hardass. You probably have this\nproblem with a lot of the men you date, where you come across as kind of a hardass....\nAnd to be honest, I don't think men really want to date women as smart as they are.\"\nJesus, I thought, you already broke up with me; can't you just let me go? Why do you\nhave to rip into me like this? I wondered how much of what he was saying was about me,\nand how much was him trying to make sense of his own feelings. But even though I felt\nsure that he was confused, his words sent an icy spike straight through me. \"I don't think\nmen really want to date women as smart as they are....\"\n\"I've worked really hard to become less argumentative,\" I said. \"You should have seen\nme when I was a teenager.... I don't know if I can tone myself down any more than I\nalready do.\" Even as I said it, I wondered why I was still talking to a guy who'd just said\nthat men don't want to date women as smart as they are. I felt like a bad feminist.\n\"Oh, you shouldn't tone yourself down!\" said Mr. Ambition. \"It makes you attractive....\nAttractive intellectually, I mean.\"\nI sighed. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Intellectually.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said again.\n\"I'm going home,\" I said.\n\"We're still friends, right?\" he asked.\n\"Yes, but give me some time to get over this,\" I said. \"Probably about a month.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" He came after me as I walked to the door. \"Like, you don't want to\nsee me at all for a month? You don't want me to call you, or reach out to you, or\nanything?\"\nI looked at him, again, for a long moment. I regretted his stricken expression. Again, I\nspoke as gently as I could. \"Maybe in a month.\"\nHe offered me a ride, which I declined. My fifteen-minute estimate was almost on target:\ntwenty minutes later, I stepped into my bedroom, leaned back against my door and burst\ninto tears.\n* * *\nI ran into Richard the next evening, and we spent the night together. Richard put a fair\namount of effort into convincing me to talk to Mr. Ambition.\n\"It sounds like he didn't actually mean to break up with you,\" said Richard. \"It sounds\nlike the conversation got away from him. He didn't start that conversation intending to\nbreak up with you; maybe he was looking for reassurance, and you approached his\nquestions too logically, and he concluded that you don't care. You really like him. It\nseems like it's worth trying to make it work.\"\nYou may have noticed that both of these men tried hard to convince me that the other\nman cared about me. I decline to analyze what that means about me and my current\napproach to relationships.\nHowever, I will say that I tried giving Richard more emotional feedback than I have in a\nlong time; I even told him I missed him the next time he went on vacation. And I did try\ntalking to Mr. Ambition again, and he acknowledged that he hadn't exactly intended to\nbreak up with me.\nBut then Mr. Ambition and I had several of those encounters that I think of as \"postbreakup\ntalks.\" I hate that shit. Every evening ended on a confusing, inconclusive note.\nHe kept saying that he was \"confidently ambiguous.\" We weren't dating, we weren't not\ndating. It reminded me of a phase I went through with a college ex-boyfriend, back in my\nmonogamous days: my ex and I spent several weeks post-breakup being \"exclusive but\nnot together.\" So preposterous. People are so broken.\nMr. Ambition himself has described uncertainty as an \"emotional amplifier\"... but\nsometimes it amplifies in the wrong direction. After a week or so, I got fed up and cut\nthings off. He asked when we would talk again, and I told him I didn't want to talk for a\nwhile. A few days later, I broke my neck in a bicycle accident.\nIt's like a goddamn soap opera, isn't it? Sometimes I can't believe this stuff happens to\nme.\n* * *\nMr. Ambition showed up in my hospital room while no one else was around. I was no\nlonger afraid that I might die, but I was leaden with morphine, and anxious. I awaited the\nneurosurgeons who would come install a big scary spinal brace, and I felt grateful and\nglad to see Mr. Ambition. I hadn't been certain he would come, although if he'd had such\nan accident, I would have moved Heaven and earth to go see him.\n\"I came as soon as our friends told me,\" he said. \"There are so many people who love\nyou.\" He said my name, and spoke softly, and the words bruised my heart.\n\"Thank you,\" I said inadequately.\n\"I had to skip out on work to get here,\" he said, and sat next to my bed. \"We're in the\nmiddle of important negotiations. A billion-dollar deal.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"Maybe you shouldn't have come.\"\nHe laughed. \"Don't you think you're worth a billion dollars?\"\n\"Probably not,\" I said.\nHe took my hand. \"Is there anything I can get you?\" he asked.\nI wasn't allowed to eat or drink before the surgery. \"Tell me a story,\" I requested.\nMr. Ambition retold a story from Dostoevsky's The Idiot. It was about a big-hearted man\nwho comes to a small community and befriends an outcast \"fallen woman.\" The bighearted\nman gains high status in the community, but when people find out that he's\nfriends with the marginalized sex worker, they become angry. Despite their\ncondemnation, the man stays steadfastly loyal to his friend, and by seeing the way he\ncares about her, eventually the community accepts her too.\nIt was exactly the kind of story I expected to hear from him. I thought of the moment,\nsitting in bed, where he'd said: \"If you're strong enough, you can walk into a trap.\" The\nmoment when I'd realized that I could fall in love with him.\nAfter Mr. Ambition finished the story, the doctors arrived with the brace. This\ncontraption involved using power tools to put four screws directly into my skull, which\nstabilize seven pounds of metal. For realz. I was awake while they did it, too. Luckily I\ngot local anesthesia, so the screws didn't hurt while they were going in -- but I heard the\nbone crunching, and I felt the pressure building. Also, my neck hurt a lot. It was\nreasonably horrible.\nSome of my friends said later that they arrived at the hospital and tried to get into my\nroom while the brace was being installed, and they couldn't get in, but they heard me\nscreaming. I don't remember screaming, so I deny everything.\nI tried to talk normally while it was happening. I felt like the whole affair was probably\nmore taxing for the doctors than it was for me. I mean, at least I had morphine.\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said to one of the doctors. \"People must say awful things to you while\nyou're doing this procedure.\"\n\"One woman told me how much she hated me,\" the doctor said tranquilly.\nI tried not to cry, but I cried. Like I said: soap opera territory.\nMr. Ambition never let go of my hand.\n* * *\nMr. Ambition visited me in the hospital for hours every day. He brought me all kinds of\nawesome vegan smoothies. He met my parents, and got along well with them.\nWhen she got a moment alone with me, my best girlfriend asked what was up with him.\n\"You guys broke up, didn't you? What's next?\"\n\"I'm not sure,\" I said. \"We haven't talked about it.\"\nWhen I was able to go home, Mr. Ambition helped move me in. My air conditioner had\nstopped working, which is not fun for August in Chicago, especially for a person wearing\na fur-lined brace. He promised to lend me a fan.\nI can't turn my head, so when Mr. Ambition arrived with the fan, I didn't realize it was\nhim until he was standing right next to me. I was alone in my room, lying in bed, wearing\nonly the brace and my underwear while I answered text messages. This was not as sexy\nas it sounds. Unless you're a medical device fetishist. In which case, I guess it was\nexactly as sexy as it sounds.\nThe fan was quickly installed next to my bed. I felt awkward because I was half-naked\nand wearing a complex brace. I felt awkward because I couldn't help with the fan. I also\nfelt awkward because I was racking up unpayable debt to a man who was, to all\nappearances, my ex. I tried to cover my discomfort by answering some more texts; then I\nlooked up at Mr. Ambition. I couldn't read his expression.\nI felt oddly expressionless, myself. I felt wrung out. I couldn't think of any words I\nwanted to say.\nMaybe that was our moment of truth: the moment had no chemistry at all.\nI gave Mr. Ambition my hand. \"Thank you so much for everything,\" I said.\n\"Of course,\" he said, squeezed my hand, and left.\n* * *\nAfter my accident, Richard sent me a quick email, then didn't contact me for over a\nmonth. I remembered what Mr. Ambition had said -- encouraging me to send more\nemotional signals -- so tried inviting Richard for dinner, and he didn't answer my text\nmessages. When I finally ran into Richard, I asked why he'd been ignoring me, and he\nlaughed. \"I knew you'd accuse me of ignoring you,\" he said. I felt like I'd walked into a\ntrap.\nI was hurt, obviously. I was surprised by how hurt I was. The problem with my youthful\nwater metaphor is that water is basically invulnerable, but I am not... and when I was\nyounger and more open, I had much more trouble setting important boundaries.\nOn the other hand, I had to admit that it was funny, too. I mean, it wasn't like I didn't see\nthis coming. I mean, my coming-out story includes a portrait of Richard at his most\ndifficult. One of the friends I share with Richard made a comment about leopards and\nspots. Maybe my life is a soap opera, but it could also be a sitcom with the most amazing\ncharacterization ever.\nI enlisted a cold, brilliant, evil-hearted friend to help draft my final letter to Richard. The\nletter was very short. Arguably, it was brutal. It read:\nEconomists recognize that the most robust relationships are formed through a plethora\nof implicit agreements. Apparently, these agreements are not present, and probably won't\nbe. Cheers.\nEconomics arguments in the comments are encouraged. More importantly, readers may\nfeel free to steal that letter for use on whoever is trying to pull their chain.\n* * *\nI received a couple texts from Mr. Ambition, a few days after he gave me the fan. He said\nthere had been a death in his family. \"But I don't want to talk about that, actually,\" he\nwrote. \"I just want to check in and see how you're doing.\"\nI thought about how he laughed when he was hurt. I thought about how he'd once told me\nthat he wanted drama. I thought about his confusing reactions to S&M. I thought about\nhow he outsourced his emotional labor to his friends. I thought about all the emotion I'd\nfelt in him, coiled and caught and turned in on itself like a caged dragon.\nI wondered if he wanted me to push him to talk.\n\"I'm so sorry,\" I texted back. \"But I understand if you don't want to talk about it. I'm\ndoing fine.\"\nHe invited me to a social event a week later, but I declined. I didn't reach out to him for a\nwhile after that, and he didn't reach out to me. I heard later that Mr. Ambition asked one\nof my friends whether they thought he owed me anything.\nMy friend told him, quite accurately: \"No, you don't owe her anything.\"\nIf anything, I owe him. I'm not sure what I owe him, but I'm sure I owe him something.\nA billion dollars? Vegan smoothies?\nChemistry?\n* * *\nThis post can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/09/30/storytime-chemistry/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nS&M:\n[theory] Start From A Position of Strength\nI wrote this post in 2011, and I wrote it carefully because I was worried that it might be\ninterpreted as putting too much responsibility for BDSM on the submissive partner's\nshoulders. To be clear, I believe that both partners have responsibilities in a BDSM\nsituation, but I also believe that the dominant partner especially must be careful and\nresponsive. I hope that this is a theme in all my work. I really don't ever want to\nencourage people to blame the victim. However, I think it's undeniable that submissive\npartners need a sense of themselves, as well as internal strength and resources, to do\nBDSM -- especially very intense BDSM. The goal of this post was to start figuring out\nwhat that means.\n* * *\nA while back, I attended a workshop run by educator Sarah Sloane on the topic of BDSM\nand abuse. Sarah centered her workshop on a maxim that I have hereby stolen: \"Start\nfrom a position of strength, and seek strength in the end.\"\nI've been thinking about this a lot in terms of not just polyamory and BDSM, but sex in\ngeneral. All types of sexuality are more pleasurable for some people, and less pleasurable\nfor others; emotionally easier for some people, and more difficult for others. I have zero\ninterest in telling other people how they \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" deal with their sexuality,\nas long as what they're doing is consensual. I want to say right now that nothing I'm about\nto write is intended to tell others how they \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" do S&M; it's just my\nown thoughts on how I might choose and process my experiences.\nI can certainly consent to whatever, even if that thing is problematic or scary or difficult\nor complicated -- I can consent. The thing is, if I want to get something amazing and\npositive out of my experiences, I think it's good to start from a position of strength.\nIn some ways this is clear. For example, I think that being with a partner who genuinely\nwants me to have a good experience, who really cares about me, and who wants to see\nme again -- that's almost always a position of strength. Even if I have fairly intense, dark\nS&M encounters with that person, I can feel confident that he'll treat me with respect;\nthat he'll give me space and lend me strength for emotional processing afterwards.\nAlso, knowing what I want is a position of strength; understanding how I feel is a\nposition of strength. Being able to recognize my emotional difficulties, hiccups, triggers\nand landmines is a position of strength. Knowing for sure that I can call my safeword, if\nnecessary, is a position of strength. On a physical level, I prefer to do S&M when my\nbody is in good shape -- when I'm well-rested and I've eaten healthy food. That, too, is a\nposition of strength.\nIn some ways this can become murky. For example: I am rarely interested in one-night\nstands. There are a number of reasons for this, but one reason is that -- especially as a\nwoman -- feeling like a \"slut\" can be scary, difficult cultural territory. And when I don't\nfeel good about myself, my interest in one-night stands is even lower -- because I know\nthat dealing with the difficult territory of \"sluthood\" will be harder with low self-esteem.\nIf I'm feeling happy, strong, competent, valuable, and loved by the world... then onenight\nstands can easily be fun. If I doubt my worth, or if I doubt how much I deserve\nlove... then one-night stands can be self-destructive.\nThe same goes for relationships with people who don't care about me. If I'm sure that a\nguy has no emotional interest in me, then having sex with that guy can be a dangerous\nemotional proposition for me, and one that I need to feel strong for. This doesn't always\nend up being true -- I've definitely had sexual encounters that left me emotionally\nunaffected -- but sometimes it's hard to predict whether I'll want more emotional\ninvestment from a given dude, so I try to keep it in mind for all encounters. (From a\npolyamorous perspective, I've noticed that less-emotional sex is often easier to handle\nwhen I'm already in a solid relationship with someone else.)\nA couple I know in the local S&M community will sometimes have encounters that\nabsolutely blow my mind, because they seem so difficult and so psychological. Here is an\nexample: after the pair was married and child-free for many years, the wife realized that\nshe might want children after all. This was a problem for her husband, who married her\nwith the understanding that neither of them wanted kids. It became an ongoing\ndiscussion. Then the husband -- who is also the sadistic, dominant partner -- asked her if\nthey could have an S&M encounter focused around the topic. She said it was okay.\nSo, as part of an S&M class that they taught together, the husband used her new feelings\nabout children to rip into her: during the S&M encounter, he told her that she was\nprobably too old to have children, that she'd waited too long. He added that she was too\nflighty for kids; that she'd be a bad mother. He added that he had always made it clear\nthat he never wanted kids; that she was stupid for marrying someone who didn't want\nkids, and that this problem was her own fault.\nI was not present during this class, but I heard about it from some attendees, and it sounds\nlike it was really intense. He used a genuine and difficult sore spot to put his wife through\na psychological S&M wringer, with her consent.\nThese days, I feel very tempted towards encounters like that: encounters that can tear me\napart on a deep level, using important weaknesses and insecurities. I've also received\nemail from other people who want to arrange encounters like that, and who ask my\nadvice. An obvious problem is that such a relationship could easily slip into abusive\nterritory.\nSo I've thought about this a lot, and here's my conclusion: those kind of intense\npsychological encounters obey the same maxim as other BDSM -- \"Start from a position\nof strength, and seek strength in the end.\"\nThus, before having such an intense psychological encounter, I should feel that the\nencounter will ultimately -- through the pain and anxiety and tears -- make me feel more\nsupported, more capable, more powerful in the world. One angle on this is to trust my\npartner a great deal, and be sure that he wants the best for me -- to be sure that in the end,\nhe wants me to be as strong as I started... or stronger.\nIt's possible that I might not need so much support from my partner, if I get support\nelsewhere in my life: perhaps from friends, perhaps from a Kink Aware therapist, perhaps\nfrom a great job or a solid diet and exercise plan, perhaps even from another partner. (Of\ncourse, if I were planning to get extensive emotional processing support from other\npeople, then I would seek their consent beforehand.)\nStill, it seems like the easiest way to get support would be to get it from my partner, who\nwould share more of the experience with me than anyone else. This would also build our\nintimacy, which is usually a major factor in having intense S&M encounters in the first\nplace.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/07/20/slogan-start-from-a-position-of-strength/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nS&M:\n[storytime] Predicament Bondage\nI wrote this in early 2011. Amusingly, after I wrote it, one of the top Google queries that\nbrings people to my blog became the phrase \"predicament bondage.\" I think those folks\nare probably looking for porn, and I wonder if my article disappoints them.\n* * *\nPredicament Bondage\nSome people are masochists (who enjoy pain) but not submissives (who enjoy, well,\nsubmitting). Some people are really into discipline (with lots of punishment) but not\nbondage (rope, cages, etc). Some people are sadists (who enjoy inflicting sensations) but\nnot dominants (who enjoy being in control). Some people are switches, who find that\nthey can switch between roles -- they can be dominant or submissive; sadistic or\nmasochistic... I am an example of a definite switch.\nMe, I get positively bored if someone takes a long time tying me up. For other people, 45\nminutes of elaborate knotwork = really hot foreplay. I don't understand this, but that's\ncool; plenty of people don't understand my preferences and we all coexist quite happily\nanyway.\nSo yeah, \"bondage\" -- rope, cages, etc. -- is not so much my thing. But there's one phrase\nI absolutely love: \"predicament bondage.\" Predicament bondage is usually presented in a\nvery elaborate way: for example, a submissive might be tied up with ropes binding him\nsuch that his arms are in pain -- but if he moves his arms then his legs will be in pain. It's\na predicament! And it's bondage! Whee! Predicament bondage!\nHowever, it doesn't have to be elaborate to be predicament bondage. I'm not into rope\nobstacle courses, but I started loving the phrase \"predicament bondage\" after a friend\nwent to a workshop run by Fetish Diva Midori and reported back. He said:\nMidori had two pitchers of water, or maybe a pitcher and a glass. She told us, \"This is\nthe simplest form of predicament bondage,\" and she had the demo submissive hold his\nhands straight out at shoulder height. Then she placed the water in his hands. The\nsubmissive had to keep holding the water; if he failed, he knew he would be failing\nMidori. But there was never any threat of \"Midori's wrath\" if he failed her. In fact, she\nspoke as if she was on his side, part of his team. In many ways, her sympathy for his\nplight made it all the more cruel, because she was the one doing it to him.\nShe explained this. She knew that his sense of disappointment in \"failing\" her was worse\nthan anything she could actually do to him.\nSo, the predicament in that case was the submissive's increasing arm agony vs. his fear of\nfailing Midori. For me, that concept is infinitely hotter than a rope obstacle course.\nAlthough for me, in practice, I'd also want the pain to be a bit more... um... personal.\n* * *\nThe first time someone flogged me, I had no idea what he was going to do beforehand; he\nand I had the strongest dominant/submissive dynamic I've ever felt, and I put myself in\nhis hands with almost-total trust. A night came around when I felt that itch under my\nskin, the dark burn in the back of my mind... I knew I had to go see him. I wasn't hugely\nexperienced, but I knew exactly what that slow burn meant.\nIt was late. He was in bed, and I lay down next to him. \"I think...\" I said slowly, \"I want\nyou to hurt me. A lot.\"\nI felt him tense beside me.\n\"Why?\" he asked.\nI didn't look at him. \"Why do you ask me questions when you already know the answer?\"\n\"Sometimes I just want to hear you say it,\" he said, and stood up. \"Take off your clothes\nand get on your knees.\"\nI caught my breath; did as he said. When I felt the ends of the flogger trail lightly down\nmy back, I wasn't even sure what the soft sensation meant, but I was already trembling\nanyway. I am surprised by my memory of how much it hurt when he hit me. These days,\nI don't think of floggers as especially painful, but then again, I seem to recall that he left\nmore marks than I'm used to. (I loved taking off my shirt and examining the bruises in the\nmirror. I glowed for days, afterwards.) So maybe there was something particular about\nwhat he did, or about his materials. Or maybe it's just that it was my first time.\nHe created the predicament when I started to cry and flinch around. It was very simple.\nHe leaned over me. \"For the next three, keep your face down and your hands still,\" he\nsaid. \"Promise me.\"\n\"I can't,\" I said. \"I can't promise.\" I said it frantically. I was terrified of failing him. \"I\ncan't.\"\n\"You have to,\" he said gently. \"So you will.\"\nI cried harder. I sobbed so hard I couldn't speak. He stayed where he was, leaning over\nme, and kept a merciless silence. \"I promise,\" I finally said, when I could shape words.\nMy back was to him, I couldn't see his face, but I swear I felt him smile.\nWhen he hit me again, I barely moved. After the count of three, he said he wanted to see\nhow much longer I could go, but the answer was that I couldn't -- I started to flinch\nstrongly again. Of course, he kept hitting me, if only for that. But at least I hadn't broken\nmy promise. Hadn't failed him.\n* * *\nI've heard about a game in which the submissive partner stands next to a wall, and holds\ntwo coins against the wall -- one in each hand. The dominant then does, you know, some\nstuff. On the submissive's part, dropping the coins spells failure. This sounds pretty hot,\nand it's one way to make a concrete predicament. But during the above encounter -- my\nfirst time being flogged -- I assure you that it was plenty hot enough without any coins.\nWith only my promise and my awareness to keep me in line.\nSometimes I can't obey the order, no matter how hard I try. My partner may order me not\nto move, for example, when I can't help moving. If I were in the above scenario, with the\ncoins, I'm not confident that I wouldn't drop them. It's scary -- especially if I love him,\nbecause then all the emotions are multiplied. But even if I'm not in love -- as long as he's\ngot me in the right mental space, then if I fail, I will say \"I'm sorry\" over and over. I'll be\nterrified of his anger; I'll feel like I deserve punishment, and if he doesn't keep hurting me\nI'll feel abandoned.\nThe more I fail, the more it hurts -- more than physical pain ever could. Slamming up\nagainst my own limits makes me feel terribly inadequate. It's hot, but it's dangerous; it\ncan rip me apart. At times like that, I often need my partner to tell me after we're done: \"I\nstill like you and think you're a good person.\"\nAnd sometimes I need to hear that especially if I safeword out of the encounter, because\nsometimes -- not always, but sometimes -- calling my safeword can feel like the worst\nfailure of all.\n* * *\nWhen I trace some of the weirdest and most random situations that get me hot, I see that\npredicaments come up all the time. For example, I have a terrible tendency to try and\nmake out with a partner right before we're expected to be somewhere. I might be totally\ncold 30 minutes before we have to leave, but 10 minutes before we have to leave, ding!\nIt's like a switch flips. We've got to leave, but I grab him and now he's turned on, oh no!\nAnd now we're late! Whee!\nOne of my exes pointed out my tendency to make out with him while his car was stopped\nat traffic lights that were about to turn green. \"I know!\" I said. \"I don't really get why I do\nthat, myself.\" He responded, \"Predicament bondage!\"\n* * *\nSometimes, when the pain is getting intense, I'll play a little game with my partners.\n(Kind of a game, except it's also serious, or it feels serious at the time; usually, when I\nstart playing this game, I am not even close to coherent enough to ponder tactics; I'm\nrunning on instinct.) I think of this game as the \"aren't you scared of the neighbors\" game.\nIn the \"aren't you scared of the neighbors\" game, I start making noise loud enough that I\nmight catch outsiders' attention. Part of me is hoping that my partner is worried about the\nneighbors; that he'll relent, that I can use my tiny advantage to convince him to pull back.\nThat I can play for a moment of relief, a smidgen of mercy.\nOf course, if I'm lucky, my partners will then just order me to be quiet while they hurt\nme. Which creates a predicament! Because being quiet is actually not at all easy, and it\ngets more difficult the more it hurts.\nAnd then there's the distraction game. I don't always do BDSM with partners I'm sexually\nattracted to; even with partners I'm sexually attracted to, I don't always feel sexual during\nour BDSM encounters. But when I feel very attracted during a BDSM encounter, oh,\nman. That's when I play the distraction game, which involves attempting to distract him\nby turning him on. Again, I'm not really coherent enough to be planning strategy at times\nlike this; I'm more going on instinct; instinctively, it's like I'm trying to bargain. Maybe if\nI can turn him on, he'll have sex with me instead of hurting me....\nIf I'm lucky, he'll recognize what I'm doing; he'll be pleased, amused even, but he won't\nstop. One recent partner had me handcuffed to a car seat while he was hurting me. (Doing\nthis in his car was not my idea, but at least we weren't moving. Nor were we paused at a\ntraffic light.) I couldn't move too much, so I started licking his hand when he reached for\nme. Kissing his palm, his fingers -- he groaned, and then he laughed.\n\"You are a switch,\" he said, \"trying to control me even now.\" And he didn't stop.\n* * *\n\"No,\" I breathed, a few months ago, during an encounter with someone who's really good\nat this. \"You don't get to say no,\" he replied, so I bit back the word. Had to fight against\nmy own desperate instinct to say it, over and over.\nLater, he murmured, \"It's so cute how you act like you don't want this,\" as he leaned in to\ninflict dark bruises on my shoulder. His words almost brought me to tears. But I don't\nwant it. Do I? How can I want something that hurts like this? But I'm not stopping him --\ndid I really ask for this -- I must want it -- Forcing me to face up to my own consent: a\npredicament?\nI fought back when he hurt me, instinctively pushing him away. \"Don't push me away,\"\nhe instructed. \"Put your arms around me,\" and I did. But we moved around, and moved\nagain, so I had my arms back -- and again, I couldn't seem to control my instinctive\nstruggling.\nAnd so he stopped for a moment, held my arms in place, and laid down the law. He\nknows I very much prefer some kinds of pain over other kinds of pain, so he told me this:\n\"If you want the kind of pain you like, you have to let me in close.\" Layer upon layer:\nhe's not just forcing me to take the pain; he's making me complicit. I think there were also\npractical considerations, in that it was actually difficult for him to control how he hurt me\nwhen I struggled a lot, but, still.... It was so hot it made me gasp.\nI'm not sure, but I suspect that a few years ago, I might not have been able to handle that\nlevel of complicitness: forcing me to acknowledge what I like. Back then, I was too\nappalled by my own desires. Now, this level of complicitness adds another level of pain\n-- emotional pain; mild pain that I can cope with -- which is awesome. But although\nfeeling complicit is a new tactic, it's part of an old game. It's merely another kind of\npredicament.\nFundamentally, what's hot about predicament bondage isn't the mechanics of what my\npartner says or does. It's not about the scenario or the equipment or the exact words. It's\nknowing that he won't stop hurting me, no matter how I fight or beg or scream. It's\nfeeling that every moment, every action reinforces how much I'm in his power.\nIt's knowing there's no way out.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/01/07/storytime-predicament-bondage/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nRELATIONSHIPS:\n[theory] Relationship Tools: Monogamy, Polyamory, Competition, and\nJealousy\nI wrote this in 2012, but it's the culmination of over a decade of thought. I came across\nmy first polyamory books when I was very young, and I remember that even though I was\ninexperienced, I felt super frustrated by how most polyamorists discuss jealousy. They\nwere incredibly un-empathic about it; the advice always seemed to boil down to \"Get\nover it,\" with a dollop of \"Stop being so selfish,\" and without any acknowledgment of\nhow painful and difficult jealousy can be for the person who's feeling it. But at the same\ntime, most monogamists aren't much better about this topic! Many monogamists\napproach jealousy as something that requires no examination at all.\nIn this essay, I'm trying to come to a better understanding of all these dynamics. I also\nseek to integrate them with BDSM theory, which I'm convinced has a much stronger\nbearing on jealousy than most people will admit.\n* * *\nRelationship Tools: Monogamy, Polyamory, Competition, and Jealousy\nLast year, I wrote a piece called \"In Praise of Monogamy.\" I currently practice polyamory\nin my relationships, but I spent years dating monogamously. I've noticed that when\npeople talk about monogamy, they usually either assume that it's the only way to go... or\nthey assume that it has to be thrown out the window entirely. I think that this either-or\napproach is completely wrongheaded, so the goal of \"In Praise of Monogamy\" was to talk\nabout the advantages of monogamy in a more neutral, nuanced way. Different\nrelationship models are all tools in a toolbox, and some people are better with some tools\nthan others.\n\"In Praise of Monogamy\" was probably one of my most successful articles ever -- it was\nrepublished at a ton of websites, including high-profile venues like The Guardian.\nSimultaneously, the article got a lot of really mixed comments. Some people felt that I\nwasn't praising monogamy enough; others felt that I wasn't praising non-monogamy\nenough; there were lots of other frustrations too. My big takeaway was that these\nconversations don't happen enough, most people aren't used to having them, and it's\nreally hard to know where it start.\nJealousy is one obvious starting point, because people always bring it up in conversations\nabout non-monogamy. I talked a little bit about jealousy in \"In Praise of Monogamy.\" If\nyou've recently read that piece, then feel free to skip to the end of the following italicized\nexcerpt:\nSome people experience jealousy more than, or less than, or differently from other\npeople. Plenty of people in non-monogamous relationships experience jealousy -- and\nplenty of non-monogamous people handle it just fine, through open-hearted\ncommunication.\nBut there are also plenty of people who appear to lack the \"jealousy chip.\"\nAnd then there are plenty of people who experience so much jealousy, who feel that\njealousy is such a big part of their emotional makeup, that the best way to manage it is\nsimply through monogamy.\nPersonally, I used to get a lot more jealous than I do now. I think I'm less likely to get\njealous these days partly because I've gotten better at finding low-drama men. Jealousy\nhas a reputation for being an irrational emotion, and sometimes it genuinely is an\nunreasonable, cruel power-grab. But I think jealousy is often quite rational, and often\narises in response to a genuine emotional threat... or deliberate manipulation.\nThere's another reason, though... I've also noticed that some switch in my brain has\nflipped, and I've started to eroticize jealousy. I occasionally find myself fantasizing about\nmen I care about sleeping with other women, and sometimes the fantasy is hot because I\nfeel mildly jealous. I cannot explain how this happened. It surprised me the first time it\nhappened, believe me. What's really fascinating is that I think the same part of me that\neroticizes jealousy, is the part that used to make me feel sick at the thought of my partner\nsleeping with someone else. S&M masochism: the gift that never stops giving!\nI think it's important to note here that I didn't become less jealous because I felt like I\n\"should,\" or because I was told not to be jealous. In fact, I had an early boyfriend who\nacted like I was a hysterical bitch every time I got jealous... and he made things much\nworse. With him, I just felt awful when I got jealous; I couldn't get past it. I felt like he\nwas judging me for something I couldn't help; I felt like my mind was fragmenting as I\ntried to force myself to \"think better\" without any outside support; and worst of all, I felt\nlike I couldn't rely on him to respect my feelings.\nIt was the men who treated my emotions like they were reasonable and understandable\nwho decreased my jealousy. It's much harder to be jealous when your partner is saying,\n\"I totally understand,\" than it is when your partner is saying, \"What the hell is the matter\nwith you?\" Maybe that's what makes monogamy such an effective jealousy-management\ntactic: monogamy can be like a great big sign or sticker or button you can give to your\npartner that says, \"I respect your jealousy.\" Which is not to say that monogamy is always\neffective for this -- we all know that monogamous people get jealous all the time! (Which\nonly adds to my point that monogamy might be viewed as just one of many tactics, rather\nthan an answer, when jealousy is a problem.)\nNow, back to the current article. Jealousy is an incredibly hot-button topic, so I'm\nnervous about this, but let's focus in on it a little more.\n* * *\nThe Feeling of Jealousy\nJealousy and its cousin, competition, are both things that happen a lot in relationships.\nSome people are so uncomfortable acknowledging this that they repress those feelings, or\nignore the behavior that goes along with them... but I've rarely seen that end well. I\nbelieve that some people lack jealousy and competitive urges, but I've also seen a lot of\npeople who feel those things but can't admit it. Not even to themselves.\nI dated a guy last year who told me at the start of our relationship that he never got\njealous. At first I took him at his word, but I quickly noticed that he changed the subject\naggressively when I mentioned past lovers. We had a mutual friend with whom I had a\nlot of chemistry; when the three of us were together, my boyfriend acted uncomfortable\nand irritable, and when I specifically acted in ways that made it obvious I was with him --\nlike by giving him Public Displays of Affection in front of the other guy -- he relaxed.\nI sighed internally when I observed this, and I felt frustrated, but wasn't sure how to talk\nabout it without sounding like I was calling him a liar. Fortunately, he brought it up later.\n\"I think I do get jealous sometimes, and I just don't like to think about it because it makes\nme feel like a bad person,\" he said, one night while we were making dinner. In that\nmoment, my respect for him skyrocketed. It's hard for people to keep track of themselves\nlike that, and to shift their self-image when confronted with new evidence.\nSome people seem to interpret their lovers' jealousy as a sign of love. Hey, I'll admit that\nI've had moments of being flattered or pleased when my boyfriends show signs of\njealousy -- or when they act a little competitive. Sometimes those things are scary,\nthough... or threatening... or frustrating, like in my example above. It's complicated!\nHowever, I often see those dynamics play out in ways that the participants won't admit,\nno matter how much evidence comes up. I think it gets especially complicated when\npeople experience jealousy as a sexual thing, a turn-on. Most people have a hard enough\ntime discussing their sexuality in the first place. When you add an ingredient as\ncontroversial as jealousy, the potential discussions become that much more combustible.\nWhen I was researching pickup artists for my awesome book Confessions of a Pickup\nArtist Chaser, I found a number of discussions in that community that praise competitive\nfeelings because they're seen as making the relationship more fun. A lot of these guys say\ncompetition among different lovers within open relationships is awesome because it\nkeeps everyone a little uncertain, and encourages them to be \"on top of their game.\" This\ncontrasts drastically with most polyamorous perspectives; in my experience, poly folks\nsee jealousy and competition as things that should be compartmentalized and managed\nvery carefully, rather than encouraged or exalted. For polyamory theorists, a feeling of\nsafety is often the goal, as opposed to a feeling of competition.\nAnd emotional safety is certainly a concern, because jealousy is one of the most intense\nand overwhelming emotions out there. It's such a hard feeling to sit with and work\nthrough. My worst experiences of jealousy felt like I was choking, like I couldn't breathe,\nlike I was sick to my stomach, like I was terribly obsessed, like I couldn't think of\nanything but the jealousy and how much it hurt. And yet... I've occasionally felt jealousy\nthat was weak, almost nice, where I felt a little twinge of it and turned to my lover and\ngot reassured... and that made me feel more safe, more cared for, more loved.\nThe bottom line is that people experience jealousy and competitive urges in many\ndifferent ways. It's important to acknowledge that and honor it. I don't see it as\nproductive to frame things like \"jealousy is bad,\" or \"competition is awesome.\" I'd much\nrather frame things like: \"Jealousy and competition happen sometimes, and how do\nwe deal with them when they come up so that everyone involved feels comfortable\nand happy?\"\n* * *\nThe Toolkit\nI firmly believe that the primary tools for dealing with jealousy and competitive\nurges are honesty, good faith and respect. If you're feeling jealous, then take a deep\nbreath. (I'm pretty sure that most relationship drama could be avoided if more people took\ndeep breaths.) Hopefully, you're dating someone who you like and trust (if you're not,\nwhat's the point?). Remind yourself that this person, who you like and trust, probably is\noperating in good faith and isn't trying to hurt you. Respect that this person has their own\ndesires, which won't always overlap perfectly with your own. Don't assume that your\npartner is obliged to do everything you want -- but do be honest about what's hurting you,\nso you can work it out together.\nAnd, in turn: if your partner is jealous, respect that emotion. Remind yourself that this\nperson, who you like and trust, probably is operating in good faith and isn't trying to\ncontrol you. Be honest about how your partner's jealousy makes you feel, and think about\nways to reassure your partner while protecting your own needs and boundaries.\nThe most stable relationship formation for dealing with jealousy and competitive urges\nappears to be monogamy. To be sure, I think people have plenty of other reasons for\nchoosing monogamy. But the relationship tool that seems to work most thoroughly, and\nmost often, and for the most people, is simply... being monogamous.\nThere are many ways of approaching non-monogamy, but the one I'm most familiar with\nis polyamory. A lot of polyamorists, though not all, organize their relationships into\nhierarchies: they have one or more \"primary relationships,\" and then \"secondary\nrelationships\" and other relationships that don't make it to secondary level. Sometimes a\nprimary partner will have \"veto power\" -- i.e., if one partner wants to get a new partner,\nthen the primary partner can explicitly block that partner. This seems to help control a lot\nof jealousy and competitive behavior.\nSome poly folks say that they see hierarchies and veto power as \"blunt instruments,\" and\nthat they prefer to negotiate every interaction case-by-case. This sounds fine to me as\nlong as it works for them, of course. But I would offer this: I think that blunt instruments\nare sometimes the most useful tool for a given project. And in fact, blunt instruments are\nmore often useful than finer-tuned instruments. The whole idea of finer-tuned\ninstruments is that they're useful for precise circumstances... but they're also harder to\nuse, and more fragile. Some people don't have the time or inclination to create a whole\nnew toolkit for every individual relationship. Some people will settle for a slightly less\nprecise, perfect relationship in exchange for a more stable one. Sometimes it's simply\neasier to use a blunter, but more universally effective tool.\nI will also add that I have seen plenty of polyamorous relationships in which there were\nunspoken hierarchies, and unspoken veto power. This resulted in maneuvering that\nstruck me as both underhanded and unnecessary. I've always felt that it would be better\nfor everyone involved if those dynamics were put out on the surface.\nFinally, for people who like jealousy and competition.... If S&M has taught me anything,\nit's that it's quite possible to play with pain and power within a safe, loving framework.\nThe key is to compartmentalize the whole process and discuss it openly. If people are into\ncompetitive relationships, then okay. If people like jealousy, then okay. But in that case,\nthey really ought to look for partners who share those tastes, and to find ways that they\ncan deal with them openly and honestly.\nIn S&M, there's a huge emphasis on careful communication tactics -- safewords are the\nmost famous example, but there are plenty of others. There's also a huge emphasis on\ntalking about the S&M encounter and processing it together afterwards; we call this\naftercare. If jealousy and competitiveness can be understood as consensual games of pain\nand power, then I think people who want to play those games would do well to learn\nabout S&M communication tactics. If you're going to have fun making your partner feel\nan emotion as intense as jealousy, then you might consider giving your partner a\nsafeword.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/05/01/relationship-tools-monogamy-polyamorycompetition-and-jealousy/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nEVOLUTION:\n[storytime] You Don't Always Know What You're Thinking\nI wrote this in late 2010. I have mixed feelings about it now. I think I made important\npoints, but I will also say this: if you don't have a clue what's going on in your head and\ndon't even know where to start, then that can be a bad sign. I think that when people are\nunhappy, or dealing with situations that are more than they can handle, they often settle\ninto a kind of mental \"fog\" so they don't have to think about it. (The feminist writer\nAutumn Whitefield-Madrano has a great article describing how this happens in abusive\nrelationships; she calls it \"the fog of abuse.\")\nYet at the same time, I do believe that we should consciously make space in ourselves for\nnew feelings to emerge, especially when we're pushing our limits. Self-awareness must\ninclude allowing new feelings to emerge at their own pace.\n* * *\nYou Don't Always Know What You're Thinking\nIn May 2010, I wrote a post called \"Am I Evolving Away From Monogamy?\" in which I\ntalked about my urge towards polyamory, and my confusion about that urge. I talked\nabout my previous dislike for polyamory, and I talked about how new it is for me to feel\nlike I want to be polyamorous. I talked quite a lot, really, but a week later, I started\nfeeling like I hadn't covered everything... or like I just wasn't correct about some things\nI'd written.\nBut how could I be incorrect? I was, after all, writing about myself and my own feeings.\nHow could I be wrong about what I myself was thinking?\nI guess I realized quickly that I'd claimed things about my past self that weren't quite true.\nThat didn't acknowledge my own complexity. For example, I wrote that although I've\ntoyed with polyamory in the past, my most recent poly leanings came up only because I\ngot my heart broken by a gentleman who I sometimes refer to as Mr. Inferno. I theorized\nthat perhaps I'm just scared of commitment. While it is certainly true that I'm not big on\ncommitment these days, I later recalled that actually -- at the beginning of my\nrelationship with Mr. Inferno, I had some doubts about being monogamous. I was\nmonogamous because he was very sure that was what he wanted, but I remember a point\nwhen I thought about trying to negotiate something different.\nPolyamorous people are stereotyped as being commitment-phobic. I know all about that\nstereotype -- in fact, I have angrily defended my poly friends from it for years! (Even\nwhen I was very fiercely monogamous, I got so mad when people who don't know\nanything about polyamory said ignorant things about my poly friends!) Yet I have to\nwatch out for that stereotype's influence on me anyway. When I forgot that I'd considered\npolyamory with Mr. Inferno, was I being influenced by that stereotype? Or was I just\nmissing Mr. Inferno a lot that day, and wishing I could talk to him, and maybe therefore\nremembering him as more influential in my life than he actually was? Or... what?\nI'm visiting my father right now; we went out to dinner the other night and talked about\nrelationships. I'm quite open about my parents about almost everything -- we don't talk\nexplicitly about our sex lives, but we do have detailed conversations about stuff like\npolyamory. My dad is not at all attracted to polyamory, and we used to commiserate and\ntheorize about how we just didn't understand polyamory.\nNow that I've decided to pursue poly, my dad is puzzled. \"I know this is weird,\" I said to\nhim during dinner, \"because we used to be on the exact same wavelength about this,\" and\nhe nodded. He asks questions, he tries to figure out where I'm coming from -- and they're\nall questions that I have decent theoretical answers for. Answers include: \"Well, of course\nit's possible to love more than one person at a time. Mothers can love multiple children,\nkids can love multiple parents, friends can love each other, so why wouldn't it be possible\nfor people to have sexual and emotional relationships with multiple people?\" Or:\n\"Jealousy can be managed just fine, as long as partners are communicating well and\ngenuinely care about each others' feelings.\"\nIn fact, some of my answers are the same theoretical answers that he and I discussed\nback when we were both steadfastly monogamous. Except this time, I'm giving him those\nanswers from the other side; and yet he can't relate any better to them, this time around.\n* * *\nI have always spent a very large amount of time obsessively analyzing my own\nemotions, and often writing about them. This has been true since childhood. However,\none analytical skill I can always improve is this: knowing when to say, \"I'm not sure how\nI feel about that.\"\nAnother important skill is staying on top of the stories I tell about myself, the ideas and\nmemes and images and narratives that I'm trying to match myself to. It seems impossible\nto track all the influences on my psyche, all the different social and cultural and even\nbiological forces. Where am I under all the programming? It's worth trying to figure it out\n(even if I'll never know for sure).\nI don't always know what I'm thinking. I don't believe that anyone always knows what\nthey're thinking. It's important to acknowledge this, because when people don't\nacknowledge it, they often simply decide to be something that doesn't quite match up\nwith what they want. Sometimes this works fine -- if the pattern a person chooses to\nimpose on her self can function, then who cares if it's a perfect match? (I mean, arguably,\npeople are always imposing unmatched patterns on our thoughts and selves.) But\nalthough this sometimes works fine, there are plenty of times when it doesn't work fine.\nOr really at all.\nI have a section in my sexual communication workshop for maxims -- little slogan-like\nthings. I recently added a new one that I really like: \"You don't always know what you're\nthinking.\"\n* * *\nI've been practicing BDSM for a while, now, and it has been amazing. I've had a lot of\nvery intense sexual experiences and I feel incredibly confident about my sexuality. I feel\nvery far away from my younger self, who realized that she was into BDSM and\ncompletely freaked out. However, I used to keep a very detailed (albeit sporadic)\npersonal journal, and this allows me to look into the head of 20-year-old Clarisse. Here's\nsomething I wrote only a couple of weeks after I met Richard, my first serious BDSM\npartner:\nOn the surface I have a hard time understanding why this has shocked me so much -- the\nfact that I wanted him to hurt me, the fact that even as I was facing down my demons and\ncrying and incoherent I wanted him to keep biting me, scratching me, bruising me, and\nGod, it was bad, but even now I wish it had been far worse... on some level I want to\nhave been physically scarred. He stopped finally because I started saying \"no,\" and\ncouldn't formulate a coherent answer through my tears when he asked me if I was\nserious. But, of course, although I was serious, I also didn't want him to stop. Of course.\nOf course I wanted him to hear me saying no and keep going, to be protesting and\noverridden. And the reason I couldn't formulate a coherent answer wasn't even that I\ndidn't know the answer was, \"Yes, keep going.\" It was that I knew the answer was yes,\nand when I faced it I started crying so hard I couldn't speak, and he... sensitively, I\nguess... decided it was time to stop.\nHow cliche I am. (God, I'm sounding like some naive ingenue from a random de Sade\nplay or something, just discovering my sexuality or whatever.) How self-conscious. And\nhow humiliated and ashamed. Of all the things I think I expected from myself for this, if it\never came true that this was what I wanted -- I never really actually expected to be\nashamed.\nWhat I think is especially interesting about those paragraphs is that I felt a certain\nrecognition for my BDSM identity, I felt a certain inevitability about learning what I\nneeded. It made sense to me. \"Of course,\" I wrote, over and over. And at the same time I\nacknowledged that I had considered BDSM before -- but that I hadn't really known what\nthat meant, and I'd had no idea how I would feel if I found it. I knew what I was thinking,\nI knew what I had been thinking, and yet at the same time I didn't know. I had no idea. I\nwas completely confused.\nI'm not so confused anymore. These days.... There are a lot of things I don't know, but\nthere are an awful lot of things I do know, too. I have gotten pretty good at knowing what\nI want, even when it's hard to figure it out. And I have a very good sense of my\nboundaries.\nBut I also keep trying to figure out how to expand them. This isn't just true with BDSM.\nArguably, my urge to go to Africa and put myself through extreme culture shock was\nsimilar to the urge I feel to expand my head with BDSM. Some of the things I want to do\nwith my life and my body and my self seem almost opaque; totally irrational; a little\nscary -- even to me. I love experiencing and analyzing emotions; experiencing and\nanalyzing personal connections -- I want to do more of that, even when there are\nemotional risks. What's past that emotion? What's under my heart? How much can I feel\nfor another person, and in what ways can I manage that? Which part of my mind will\ncatch me if I end up going over the edge? Will anything?\n* * *\nAnd so, even though I have a good sense of my boundaries, I also occasionally have the\nsense that anything could happen.\nThis is not always dramatic. Sometimes it is quite tame, like with my current\npolyamorous leanings. When I was at dinner with my father, he gently expressed concern\nabout how being polyamorous might affect me emotionally. He wasn't trying to tell me\nwhat to do -- just that he's having trouble understanding where I'm at. \"For me,\" he said,\n\"sexual relationships encourage emotional attachment,\" and talked about how he bonds\nwith one person at a time. He added, \"I simply find that if my relationship is truly\nsatisfying, I don't want more than one; I can't convince myself to be interested in more\nthan one partner.\"\nI used to feel the same way. Dad knows it, and I know it; we've said these things before.\nIt's not like I don't understand how he feels -- I totally do.\nAnd there's no guarantee that, over the course of experimenting with polyamory, I won't\nbond with a partner in a way that feels monogamous -- and then get hurt if they won't be\nmonogamous with me. I'm not convinced that I'll feel completely secure as I continue to\npursue polyamory. Recently I had one difficult morning that featured two simultaneous\nbreakups, and that was a bit much to deal with! In short, I'm not certain that polyamory is\nmy ideal. But I'm also no longer certain that it's not. And I'm really enjoying trying it out.\nHere's the thing: I'm not sure what I'm thinking... but that's okay. I know I could end up\ngetting hurt... and that's okay. I could get my heart broken: that's what you risk when\nyou experiment with the alchemy of your own emotions, your hormones, your body, your\nself. But I'm watching myself and being careful and communicating as clearly as I\npossibly can, and it seems to be going fine. And if poly really doesn't work out for me, I\ncan go back to monogamy.\nAnd hey, at least if I do get my heart broken, it's something else to analyze obsessively\nand then write about! That's something to look forward to.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/12/13/slogan-you-dont-always-know-what-yourethinking/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nABUSE:\n[theory] Thinking More Clearly About BDSM versus Abuse\nI wrote this post in 2011. As I noted in the intro to \"The Alt Sex Anti-Abuse Dream\nTeam,\" other BDSMers have been writing about this more and more, and the discussion\nis really heating up right now, in 2012. Thomas MacAulay Millar has a particularly good\nseries of posts on the topic, starting with:\nhttp://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/23/theres-a-war-on-part-1-troublesbeen-brewing/\n* * *\nThinking More Clearly About BDSM versus Abuse\nYears ago, when I first started thinking about BDSM and abuse, I -- like a lot of feminist\nBDSMers -- was defensive.\nWe get scared of the accusation that \"BDSM is always abuse\"... and we're accustomed to\naccusations from certain feminists such as \"those of you who pretend to like BDSM just\nhave Patriarchy Stockholm Syndrome and don't know what you really want\"... and often,\nwe're also fighting our own inner BDSM stigma demons. We get angry that our sexual\nneeds are seen as politically problematic, or unimportant.\nAnd so, for a lot of people, our instinctive angle on abuse in the BDSM community is:\n\"Shut up! That's not what's going on!\" And that's a problem.\nObviously, I don't think BDSM is inherently abusive! Exploring my personal BDSM\ndesires has given me some extraordinary, consensual, transcendent experiences and\nconnections. I also genuinely believe that BDSM has the potential to control, subvert, and\nmanage power. BDSM can be a place where people learn to understand bad power\ndynamics in past relationships; it can be a place where people learn to manage or\ndestroy bad power dynamics in their current relationships; it can be a place where\npeople find glory, self-knowledge and freedom by manipulating their own reactions\nand responses to power. The sex theorist Pepper Mint has a great, complicated essay\nabout this called \"Towards a General Theory of BDSM and Power\". And here's one of\nmy favorite quotations on the matter, from a submissive and former blogger who went by\nvioletwhite:\nIt's ironic that the most perverse manipulations of power in my life occurred in a past\nvanilla relationship, where I tolerated tyranny because the normative structure of our\nrelationship obscured the fact that that is what it was.\nStill, I've seen things happen in the BDSM community that turned my stomach. Terrible\nmanipulative behavior exhibited by people who have the greatest reputations. Blaming\nthe victim when they try to speak up. Telling \"rumor mongers\" to shut up when people\nare trying to talk openly about problematic community members. The BDSM subculture\nhas its own version of rape culture, where \"lying bitch\" and \"drama queen\" and\n\"miscommunication\" are used against abuse survivors. Miscommunications do happen...\nbut not everything that could be a miscommunication is actually a miscommunication.\nOh yes, rape culture can happen in BDSM just the same way it happens in the \"vanilla\"\nmainstream. And there are certainly people in my local community who I would never\nget involved with, because I do not trust them.\nBeing defensive about BDSM and abuse won't help; yes, BDSM is stigmatized and\nstereotyped, but the abuse is still a problem. So after I started blogging, I tried to move\npast my defensiveness and write more concretely -- to write about what exactly the\nBDSM community does to work against abuse. One of my first posts on BDSM and\nabuse was called \"Evidence That The BDSM Community Does Not Enable Abuse.\" It\nhighlighted anti-abuse initiatives within the BDSM community. As I learned more about\nBDSM and abuse, and my perspective got more nuanced, I wrote a more expansive post\ncalled \"The Alt Sex Anti-Abuse Dream Team.\" It covered all the information I'd given in\nthe earlier post, and also talked about how I personally would structure an anti-abuse\ninitiative with alt-sex people in mind.\nLooking back now, those posts still strike me as defensive. I was making good points, but\nI also think that I didn't fully understand where some feminists are coming from when\nthey react negatively to BDSM. This past year, I've learned a lot more about abusive\ngender-based violence, power, and control. And I've concluded that while BDSM is\nobviously not equivalent to abuse, we need better theory to describe the difference\nbetween BDSM and abuse, and we should try to avoid defensiveness while articulating\nthat theory.\nI've written before that one thing I think people can do is try to \"start from a position of\nstrength, and seek strength afterwards.\" The overall point of that maxim is that any given\nBDSM activity can eventually make all parties feel more supported, more capable, more\npowerful in the world. That's my ideal end goal; that is what I personally would aim for\nwith my BDSM practice. Perhaps I might do an intense BDSM scene that makes me\nfeel terrible in the moment -- or for a lot of moments... but I want to be sure it will\nmake me more supported, more capable, more powerful later.\nThat's an awfully vague maxim, though, and one that can be different for every person. I\nmay have found a more concrete focus in a 1984 anti-abuse concept -- the Power &\nControl Wheel:\nIn 1984, staff at the Domestic Abuse Intervention Project (DAIP) began developing\ncurricula for groups for men who batter and victims of domestic violence. We wanted a\nway to describe battering for victims, offenders, practitioners in the criminal justice\nsystem and the general public. Over several months, we convened focus groups of women\nwho had been battered. We listened to heart-wrenching stories of violence, terror and\nsurvival. After listening to these stories and asking questions, we documented the most\ncommon abusive behaviors or tactics that were used against these women. The tactics\nchosen for the wheel were those that were most universally experienced by battered\nwomen.\nIn a BDSM context, a lot of the behaviors listed on the Power & Control Wheel could be\npart of a consensual encounter -- violence, headgames, name-calling, all kinds of things\ncan be BDSM. But this part, this is important:\nMINIMIZING, DENYING AND BLAMING:\n* Making light of the abuse and not taking her concerns about it seriously.\n* Saying the abuse didn't happen.\n* Shifting responsibility for abusive behavior.\n* Saying she caused it.\n(The original wheel uses gendered language, but I'd like to note that although abuse is\nmost often perpetrated by men against women, abuse can happen in any kind of\nrelationship and to people of any gender.)\nIn the brilliant documentary Graphic Sexual Horror, which profiles a now-defunct\nBDSM porn site, there's footage of a scene with a porn model named S4. The dominant\npartner slaps S4 across the face, and S4 reacts angrily. She says something like, \"We\ndidn't talk about that in advance!\" The dominant doesn't apologize; he doesn't take her\nseriously, and he doesn't talk to her carefully or work to calm her down. Instead, the\ndominant partner snaps: \"We can't talk about everything in advance,\" and aggressively\ndemands to know whether she's ready to continue. This is an example of minimizing,\ndenying, and blaming.\nI have some sympathy for his awkward position -- I've made small mistakes as a\ndominant partner, too, and he's correct that it's impossible to talk about everything in\nadvance. But the way to deal with those mistakes is by apologizing sincerely and\nmaking sure the mistake never happens again. For example, one of my exes really\nhated being bitten on the lips, and at one point I bit him on the lower lip. And he called\nme out, and I said, \"I'm sorry,\" and I put my arms around him to offer comfort; I said, \"I\nwon't do it again,\" and I didn't.\nMy experience of BDSM relationships is that it's best for there to be both communication\nahead of time -- and lots of discussion and processing afterwards. Both partners get to set\n\"hard limits\": things they absolutely don't want to do. If one partner has concerns, those\nconcerns get airtime. Both partners acknowledge a role in the proceedings, and blame\nisn't spread around; even if something goes wrong, the discussion focuses on how to\nprevent that from happening again rather than making accusations.\nAnd if BDSM is happening, it must be possible to acknowledge it, even if it's subtle. For\nexample, I ran into a partner on the street the other day; he gave me a hug and held me in\nplace for a while, even though I tried to move away. This, my friends, is subtle BDSM.\nWhich was fine with me! But it was only okay because I knew I could call him out on it\nlater and be sure it was acknowledged!\nAnd I did mention it later, and he did acknowledge it, and we both laughed and said it\nwas hot. And if I had told him not to do it, that would have been okay too. And the fact\nthat I knew I could talk about it, that I knew I could tell him not to do it and he'd\nlisten... meant that I also could have declined to mention it, and I would have felt\nfine.\nSomething else worth acknowledging here is time boundaries. If a person is indeed\ncalling names, controlling what the other person does, etc, then it's often useful for it to\nbe communicated -- and also time-bounded. For example: \"You can only call me pathetic\nduring this sexual encounter. Otherwise, please don't.\"\nThere are BDSM couples that get rid of time boundaries, and have ongoing BDSM\nrelationship situations; there are also BDSM couples that don't use safewords. I think\nthose relationships require a lot of understanding and care from all parties involved. I've\nnever gone without safewords, but sometimes I go without time-bounding, and when I\ndo, I make very sure that I can trust my partner and communicate well with him. (Thomas\nMacAulay Millar calls safeword-free BDSM \"the advanced class.\")\nThe same group that made the Power & Control Wheel has another useful wheel -- the\nEquality Wheel. Here's the text of the wheel:\nECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP:\n* Making money decisions together.\n* Making sure both partners benefit from financial arrangements.\nNEGOTIATION AND FAIRNESS:\n* Seeking mutually satisfying resolutions to conflict.\n* Accepting changes.\n* Being willing to compromise.\nNON-THREATENING BEHAVIOR:\n* Talking and acting so that she feels safe and comfortable expressing herself and doing\nthings.\nRESPECT:\n* Listening to her non-judgmentally.\n* Being emotionally affirming and understanding.\n* Valuing her opinions.\nSHARED RESPONSIBILITY:\n* Mutually agreeing on a fair distribution of work.\n* Making family decisions together.\nRESPONSIBLE PARENTING:\n* Sharing parental responsibilities.\n* Being a positive, nonviolent role model for the children.\nHONESTY AND ACCOUNTABILITY:\n* Accepting responsibility for self.\n* Acknowledging past use of violence.\n* Admitting being wrong.\n* Communicating openly and truthfully.\nTRUST AND SUPPORT:\n* Supporting her goals in life.\n* Respecting her right to her own feelings, friends, activities, and opinions.\nAll these things ought to be present in a BDSM relationship! Some people do heavy roleplay\nsituations where they have specific personas that they don't want to break out of...\nand they still can make sure that all those elements are included. For example, they can\nkeep simultaneous journals about the relationship, and thereby keep up with each others'\nfeelings and consent without breaking out of their roles.\nI also think that the list is especially useful in that it highlights places where nonconsensual\ncontrol is likely to happen... and therefore, places where BDSMers\nshould be especially careful. For example, failing to support a partner's life goals would\nbe okay in the middle of an intense BDSM encounter. But afterwards, it might be good to\ngive extra support, just because that can be such an important genuine danger spot.\nJust like vanilla people, BDSMers have a lot of unspoken elements of our relationships.\nFor example -- the partner I mentioned earlier, who held me in place when I gave him a\nhug on the street. We didn't negotiate that particular act ahead of time. But we have an\nestablished relationship, and we've done similar things before; I knew that if I wanted to\ntalk about it -- or ask him not to do it -- then he'd listen. And, even more importantly, the\nrest of our relationship lines up with the Equality Wheel.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/08/02/thinking-more-clearly-about-bdsm-versusabuse/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nCOMMUNICATION:\n[theory] What Happens After An S&M Encounter \"Gone Wrong\"\nI wrote this in late 2011. At the time, I didn't mention another factor that makes it\nimportant to talk about S&M screwups: we should do it because talking openly about\nhonest mistakes makes it harder for actual abusers to hide in the S&M community. As I\nnote at the end of this piece, sometimes a miscommunication is a real miscommunication,\nbut sometimes it's a \"miscommunication\" that's covering for abuse. The only way we can\nlearn to distinguish the two is to talk openly about our screwups. It's an intimidating\nproposition; for one thing, many outsiders leap to label BDSM as \"all abuse, all the\ntime,\" and none of us wants to give those folks anything that they could use for\nammunition. But we have to start talking about this stuff more openly, because the\nalternative is creating a community where it's much easier to get away with abuse.\nIn Thomas MacAulay Millar's epic series on abuse in the BDSM community, he's got a\nwhole post dedicated to the various types of miscommunications and\nmythcommunications that can occur: http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/\ntheres-a-war-on-part-5-wallowing-in-the-sl-op/\nOtherwise, I hope that this piece is a fairly complete treatment of this incredibly difficult\ntopic.\n* * *\nWhat Happens After An S&M Encounter \"Gone Wrong\"\nI've often thought that BDSMers should talk more about our \"failed encounters.\"\nSometimes the best way to learn is through \"failure,\" or by looking at others' \"failures.\"\nBut when a BDSM scene \"goes wrong,\" it's often highly personal for everyone\nconcerned. So it's really hard to talk about and really hard to write about -- both for the\ndominant and submissive partners. This is just like any relationship, really. After all,\npeople rarely talk about their most embarrassing or awkward or otherwise difficult\n\"mistakes made\" during vanilla sex, right?\n(I use phrases like \"failed encounter\" and \"gone wrong\" and \"mistakes\" with caution,\nbecause I think these situations can often be viewed as learning experiences, and\ntherefore they are successful for a lot of purposes! But certainly in the moment they feel\nlike screwups, and a lot of the time they can make the whole relationship very difficult,\nand I think that most people who have been through them feel as though some kind of\nfailure happened... whether it was a failure of understanding, communication, empathy,\ncaution, or something else.)\nMuch of the problem, I think, is that people have such a hard time communicating\nafter serious miscommunications and mistakes.\nThe following quotation is from Staci Newmahr's Playing At The Edge, an excellent\nethnography of the BDSM community. (I've changed a few jargon terms for the sake of\naccessibility.)\nSophie had been engaged in a long and intimate S&M relationship with Carl, a friend\nwhom she deeply trusted. During the encounter she describes below, Carl changed his\napproach, and Sophie subsequently felt that Carl was somehow not quite himself. Sophie\nand Carl never quite recovered from the incident; though they remained friends and tried\nto do S&M again, it was, according to Sophie, never the same.\nSophie says: \"He was very much a rope top. That was his big thing, was tying people up.\nAnd he was excellent at tying people up. And our dynamic was always -- I mean, yes, he\nwould absolutely hurt me when the time came for that, but there was also always this\nelement -- even when he was hurting me, it was done in this incredibly, like, touchingly\ncaring way. And especially when he was tying me up, it was this soothing, wonderful\nthing.\"\nSophie continues, \"So one day... Carl starts an encounter with me. Carl had decided in\nhis head, from all the things that he's heard me say about how I play with another\npartner, that that's what I really want from an interaction, in order for it to be the most\ngratifying and valuable. So we proceeded to have an encounter where Carl was not Carl.\nAnd I didn't stop it because it was so like, I couldn't understand what was going on. I\ncouldn't understand why it felt so horrible. And it wasn't that I didn't trust him, because I\ntrust him completely. [ ... ] I just couldn't figure out what the problem is, I felt horrible\nthrough the whole thing. And he was so out of touch with me that he wasn't even aware of\nhow horrible I was feeling. The encounter went on for some time... and the second it was\nover, I... was just, like, you know, traumatized. And he was like, 'Oh my God, what's\nwrong?' [and] he carried me into the other room. I said something like, 'Where did my\nCarly go?' and then he started to cry. [ ... ] He's like, 'I was trying to give you this\nsadistic experience.'\"\nIn Sophie's story, Carl's risk backfires.... The risks were unsuccessful; each ended up\nemotionally distraught and distant. Ultimately, they sacrificed the relationship. (pages\n179-180)\nMan, that description is so intense. Let's talk about it.\nThe first thing worth noting about Sophie's story is that, while she probably had a\nsafeword, she didn't use it: she says that she \"didn't stop it.\" Sometimes, in really\nconfusing S&M scenes, submissives have trouble using their safewords. This does not\nmean safewords are worthless... but as Thomas MacAulay Millar put it when we wrote\nabout safewords, \"Tops can never be on cruise control.\" Non-verbal signals matter, and if\nan S&M partner -- top or bottom! -- starts reacting in an unusual way, it's great to check\nin with them even if they haven't used their safeword. Safewords are a useful additional\nway of communicating about sex, but they can't replace all communication.\nNote also how hard the situation was on the top partner, not just the bottom. Carl ended\nup crying afterwards!\nNext, what I find myself wondering is whether Sophie and Carl could have\ncommunicated past this incident. Sophie obviously trusted Carl, and presumably he\ntrusted her. Could they have talked it out and had a successful relationship afterwards? It\nwould have been hard, but maybe they could have done it.\nI've (rarely) had similar experiences myself -- where boundaries were severely tested, and\nafterwards it was difficult for both me and my partner to work through it. It can\nabsolutely have an immense impact on the relationship. I write about this a bit in\nConfessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser; here's a quotation from a section in my book\nwhere I'm talking to a dominant partner, with whom I just had such a difficult encounter:\nSometimes, these things happen. One partner pushes a boundary, breaks it; maybe the\nboundary was unspoken; maybe the dominant misreads signals; maybe the submissive\ndidn't yet realize that the boundary was there. When it comes to S&M, these things can\nbe so dramatic... yet sometimes they're nobody's fault. We find these mental and\nemotional blocks, and we call them landmines.\nMy partner didn't hit the landmine on purpose. He wasn't trying to push me as hard as he\ndid. And I didn't warn him off. So the important question becomes -- how does one deal\nwith such a situation afterwards?\n... \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I'm really sorry. I never want to do that to you again.\"\n\"It's okay,\" I said. \"These things happen. But please do be careful. But don't worry....\" I\ntrailed off, trying to find words.\nIt's so hard to know how to talk about this, especially with people who aren't used to\ndiscussing S&M. When there's a fuckup, sometimes both sides feel betrayed. The\nsubmissive might think: \"Maybe I didn't tell you exactly what to avoid, but sometimes it's\ntoo much to think about, sometimes it's hard to understand in the moment, sometimes I\ndon't know ahead of time. Okay, so I pushed myself too hard, but I did it because I'm so\ninto you; I did it because, in that moment, I lost track of myself. And anyway, I thought\nyou could read me. I thought you understood me. I thought you knew. You've read me\nperfectly well before; why not this time? Is it that you don't care?\"\nWhereas the dominant might think: \"Maybe I went too far, but I thought I could trust you\nto stop me. I thought I could trust you to tell me. I don't want to harm you, I just want to\npush you; I want to break down walls with you. I want to see your eyes go deep and soft.\nIt's not fair for me to feel like I fucked up, because you fucked up, too. I thought you\ncould take care of yourself. I thought you knew. You've communicated perfectly well\nbefore; why not this time? Can I rely on you?\"\nThat particular relationship didn't last, and I think that our most difficult encounter\nprobably affected our trust for each other through the end. Still, I can tell you how we\nworked on it at the time -- and I can tell you that it felt really good. We just listened to\neach other. And we both assumed that the other person had good intent. By the end of\ntalking it out -- which admittedly took a really long time; multiple days -- I trusted him\nmore than ever and I felt incredibly close to him.\nI've been thinking a lot about classic feminist anti-abuse models, which describe how\nabusers accomplish abuse. One of the tactics abusers consistently use is Minimizing,\nDenying, and Blaming their partners. Abusers claim that the abuse didn't happen; they\nclaim it wasn't important; they blame their partners for what happened. A partner who is\nwilling to listen and change will respond openly to criticism and to mistakes: a nonabusive\npartner will not minimize, deny, or blame.\nAnd those three things are what my ex-partner did not do. He never claimed that our\ndifficult encounter didn't happen; he never put the blame on me; he never insisted that it\nwas no big deal. He didn't even come close to doing those things while we talked it\nthrough. He took his emotions and dealt honestly with them, and I did my best to do the\nsame.\nAlso, in BDSM, we often talk about the concept of \"aftercare\": that is, what we say and\ndo after a BDSM scene to ground ourselves, bring ourselves back into the world, and\nconnect with our partners. It's important to give careful aftercare after any BDSM\nencounter, but if the encounter has been particularly difficult, it's doubly important. I\nhave personally had good experiences leaving Super Intense Conversations like the one I\ndescribe above until post-aftercare, when all partners have calmed down and dealt with\nany immediate emotional responses.\nI'm writing vaguely, so here are some concrete suggestions for things to say during the\nconversation after a difficult BDSM encounter:\n* \"I'm sorry.\"\n* \"I still like you and think you're a good person.\"\n* \"Do you want to talk about this now? If not now, then let's set a concrete time for later.\"\n* \"I'm feeling really vulnerable and confused right now.\"\n* \"Why do you think that happened? How were you reading me, and what were you\nthinking as you responded to me?\"\n* \"How do we feel about this now that we've discussed it, and how can we keep it from\nhappening again?\"\n* \"What have we learned about landmines? Are there any particular words or actions that\nare definitely off-limits from now on?\"\nI have one final super important caveat to add here: Not all \"screwups\" are actually\nscrewups. Some are just plain abuse. A human-shaped predator will use words like\n\"miscommunication\" and \"mistake\" to cover up what they do. This post is focused on\nhonest errors, but there are dishonest and evil people out there. In particular, if a person\n\"keeps screwing up\"... that's a terribly bad sign. It is not an inherent part of BDSM to\nfeel roiled up and confused and alienated after a BDSM encounter; most BDSMers\nfeel more intimate and connected after successful encounters.\nUPDATE, March 2012: I just found some notes that I took during a workshop about\nBDSM edgeplay that was run by Mollena Williams in late December. (Edgeplay is a term\nfor BDSM activities that feel especially intense for the participants.) Mollena suggests\nsome questions to ask beforehand:\n* Have I seen my partner do S&M before? What did they say or do that made me feel\ngood and comfortable? What did they say that made me have an intense reaction? -- Pass\nthis information on to the partner ahead of time.\n* What does my gut feeling say about this person? -- If you have a bad gut feeling about\na person, listen to it! Especially for edgeplay.\nMollena also suggested that when BDSMers play at the edge, they \"make a contingency\nplan\" ahead of time... not just for the participants, but for everyone watching, since such\nactivities often take place at dungeons. She noted that such a \"contingency plan\" might\ncontain:\n* Honesty and thoroughness, of course\n* Each partner giving each other explicit permission to safeword\n* Each partner giving each other explicit permission for \"things to not be okay\"\nafterwards\n* Having someone on hand that each partner can talk to afterwards -- not necessarily the\nsame person for everyone involved. This person could be an observer, or might know\neveryone involved in the scene, or might be relatively separate from it all such as a kinkaware\ntherapist, but the really important thing is that this person can give emotional\nsupport in every imaginable scenario.\nThanks, Mollena, for the workshop and the thoughts. I've never made such a contingency\nplan myself, but I definitely think it's worth considering for people who are planning a\nheavy scene.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/12/09/what-happens-after-an-sm-encounter-gonewrong/\nI wrote this in 2012.\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nS&M:\n[theory] Aftercare or Brainwashing?\n* * *\nAftercare or Brainwashing?\nYes, it's another article about abuse and S&M, but I'm going to cover a lot more than that.\nI'll talk about intimacy and bodily reactions and how these things build a relationship --\nwhether consensual or abusive. And I'll talk about how to deal with them, too.\nLast year, I received an email from a woman who wanted to talk about sexual desire that\nexists alongside real abuse. She has been abused, but she is sexually aroused by S&M,\nand she struggles with boundaries a lot. She wrote to me:\nHere's what destroys you: that some of us are designed to shut down and feel terror and\nhorror and arousal and shame all at the same time, to crumple before horrible people, to\nfeel aroused even as they genuinely destroy you. This is not in any one's best interest. It's\nnot hot, it's not awesome. And yet it's there.\nThe worst pain for some of us, that makes you want to scream and not exist and makes\nyou want to scream to the heavens that you want to die and escape being in your own\nbody is not that you are afraid he will come back. It's that you are aroused by the\npossibility that he will. And other than destroying your very self, you can't stop it. It is the\ncruelest of design flaws and the worst people understand it and the most compassionate\npeople don't.\nHowever, the conclusion is not that some people want abuse. By definition, abuse is\nsomething that destroys you, that leaves you feeling violated and harmed in a way you\ndon't want. And part of that mechanism, that involves the desire for the abuse to\ncontinue, is that many of us are designed to want more intimacy once intimacy has been\ninitiated with a person. Many of us don't want to be left.\nAnd the agony of feeling harmed by being left by someone you never wanted to be there\nin the first place is confusing and can be debilitating.\nNo one wants to be harmed in this way. Among abuse survivor communities the arousal\ninvolved in abuse situations is often called \"body betrayal,\" but this doesn't seem to\nencompass how deep the desires can be for some people. At the root, the desires are\noften the same desires that fit into normal healthy intimate relationships. To be loved, to\nhave an ongoing interaction, to be seen and understood at the root of all your emotion, to\nbe taken sexually and feel the pleasure of another enjoying your sexual arousal. But\nthese emotions have been exploited and manipulated for the gain of others.\nFor some number of people who have experienced abuse, the greatest split within the self\ndoes not simply come from how horrific the acts themselves were but from the feelings of\ndesire and pleasure that can happen in human beings even during horrific unwanted\nacts. For some of us, BDSM can be a safe way to explore unpacking some of this desire\nand how these arousal patterns got mixed up with horrific things -- or were already\nhooked up to horrific things and that pre-existing fact was exploited by a harmful person.\nAnd for some of us, taking that out and playing with it may not be a necessary part of\nrecovery at all.\nBut simply knowing this -- the fact that your arousal and pleasure systems can be\nactivated by harmful people is ok -- it does not mean you want it, it does not mean that it\nwas good for you, or that anyone should have treated you in that way. That can be the\ngreatest healing in and of itself.\nI want to thank her for allowing me to publish her words. Her description is so far from\nhow I usually discuss or experience S&M; and yet I see connections, too, and people\nrarely discuss those connections.\n* * *\nAftercare: Intimacy Within Positive and Consensual S&M\nA while back, a study came out that established that a consenting, positive S&M\nexperience increases a couple's intimacy afterwards. I cite that study all the time, but I\nstill find its existence kinda absurd; I mean, they could have just asked us how it felt. On\nthe bright side, if S&M is being studied by Real Researchers, it's a sign that S&M is\nbecoming more widely accepted. Yet for all its hormone level measurements and mood\nsurveys, I didn't feel like the study got anywhere near the heart of S&M and how S&M\ncreates such extraordinary intimacy. Why would it? Studies are science, and aftercare is\nart.\nI've previously defined aftercare as \"a cool-down period after an S&M encounter, which\noften involves reassurance and a discussion of how things went.\" That's a decent quick\ndefinition, but there's a lot more to it. Bodily violence sometimes creates a mental\nmalleability and vulnerability that can be used in good ways... but also in terrible ways. I\nsee aspects of this in competitive sports, especially the ones that involve fighting and\nhurting other people very directly. (Have you ever seen that phenomenon where two guys\nfight each other and then become Best Friends right afterwards?)\nBeing together with an S&M partner during aftercare can be used to free people, to make\nthem feel amazing and establish extraordinary intimacy. But it can hurt people too; it can\nhurt them terribly.\nAftercare, like subspace, is one of the most mysterious parts of S&M. Like subspace, a\nlot of S&Mers describe aftercare in nigh-mystical language. One excellent page of\naftercare advice begins by saying:\nAftercare is the last act of the SM drama. It is the culmination, the pulling together of all\nloose ends, the finishing touches, the final communion between sharers of the SM ritual,\nthe phase where the participants formally give the fantasy scene a context in everyday\nreality. Its technical purpose is to transition both players from the elevated states created\nin a scene [i.e., an S&M encounter] back into normalcy, returning to the motor control\nand awareness they will need to drive home once the scene is over. But as any good SM\npractitioner will tell you, it's much more than that. It is the time after the action when the\nparticipants come together in mutual affirmation that something special was created and\nshared. It is when affection and closeness is offered and sought. It is, at very least, the\nproper time to express thanks to the person who has shared this tiny segment of your life\nwith you. It can be, and often is, the most beautiful part of a scene, and it is part of the\nscene. To skip it altogether is as rude as having dinner at a friend's house and then\nbolting once you've eaten your fill.\nAftercare is not always extraordinary, the same way S&M isn't always extraordinary. Not\neveryone wants or needs aftercare, although I've always felt that if you \"don't do\naftercare,\" that's something to warn your partner about ahead of time.\nI guess from the outside, aftercare often looks like a combination of snuggling and\nchatting and giggling -- sometimes, crying and/or comforting. From the inside, though,\naftercare can feel like... a shot of pure empathy. Blissful connection. Words like\n\"basking\" and \"glowing\" and \"transcending\" come to mind. As someone said to me when\nI was first getting into S&M: \"Very few S&Mers actually enjoy giving or receiving pain.\nWhat they like is where pain gets them.\"\nThe Practicalities of S&M Intimacy\nI believe that S&Mers should try very hard to put boundaries around our S&M\ninteractions; we should work to communicate carefully, and compartmentalize what we\ndo. Consent, and well-communicated boundaries, are the factors that separate S&M from\nabuse. I talked about those boundaries in \"Thinking More Clearly About BDSM versus\nAbuse,\" and I also talked about them in \"What Happens After an S&M Encounter 'Gone\nWrong.'\" I've written about S&M communication tactics that enable communication and\nboundary-setting, from safewords to checklists to keeping simultaneous journals.\nAftercare is part of that boundary-setting process, but a lot of the time, people have a hard\ntime thinking or speaking clearly right after S&M. Some people become incredibly nonverbal,\nor vague and confused, or giggly, or all of the above. For this reason, some people\ninclude later follow-ups (like a next-day phone call) under the umbrella of \"aftercare\" --\nthe goal is to allow the post-S&M time to be calming and un-challenging, and then talk\nthings through when everyone's head is clearer. Processing things thoroughly after an\nS&M encounter is really important, especially if the people involved are planning to do it\nagain. It's important for two reasons: it helps the people involved get a better sense of\nwhat they want and don't want; and it helps them learn more about how to communicate\nwith their partners.\nRecently, I was privileged to give a partner his first heavy S&M experience. Afterwards,\nwhen he was coming out of it, he said to me: \"No one has ever touched me so deeply, so\nfast before.\" I lay with him, listening. I'm pretty sure I did a good job helping him pick up\nthe pieces, but when I try to figure out what I did, I have trouble describing it.\nSo I wouldn't know how to give a step-by-step \"how to\" for aftercare, but I can offer\nsome thoughts. For one thing, the person who was dominant during the encounter is\nusually the person who runs the aftercare, too. When I'm in the dominant position, the\nmessage I try to get across during aftercare is along these lines: \"I'm here, I'm listening, I\ncare about you, you're safe with me, and you can take all the time you need.\"\nIn the submissive position, I'm often too busy processing to think carefully about what\nmessage I'm getting across to my partner. But sometimes I do get the sense that he's\nconfused or anxious or needs some feedback, at which point I try to get across a message\nalong these lines: \"I care about you and I'm so grateful to you for taking on that power\njust now. If you need to talk, we will do that when I'm more alert. But for now, let's\nplease just be here together and establish our closeness.\"\nAnd when I'm switching -- or when the power dynamic is otherwise unclear -- well. I\nguess I try to get across a combination of those messages.\nThe Boundaries of S&M Intimacy\nI used to be more willing to do S&M \"on the first date,\" when I barely knew my partner.\nThat's changed for two reasons. Firstly, I've become much warier of doing S&M without\na strong foundation to the relationship. I've been lucky, because my partners have treated\nme so well, even the casual ones. (As more stories of S&M and abuse become public, I\nrealize more and more how lucky I've been.) But I don't ever want to be in a position\nwhere I do intense S&M and I can't rely on my partner afterwards; and the best way to\nbuild a reliable foundation is to spend lots of time together before we get into anything\ndeep.\nSecondly, I've become more aware of how quickly S&M can affect me. It's entirely\npossible to do excellent, intense S&M with someone I can't trust. And if that happens,\nthen boom: I'll be intensely bonded to him, yet unable to trust him. It's not a good place to\nbe. There are some kinds of S&M that feel light or even impersonal to me, but when I do\nthings that feel intense... the bond forms so fast, and it's so incredibly strong. I swear it's a\nchemical thing. My body will crave him beyond words, even if my brain knows he's a\nterrible idea.\nI once heard about a woman who won't allow herself to have orgasms during casual sex,\nbecause she knows the orgasm itself will bond her to her partner. I don't experience\norgasms that way. But when a partner really puts me under with S&M, pulls me in deep,\nand then he gives me aftercare while I surface? That's where I fall in love.\nI've heard of polyamorous S&M relationships in which the primary relationship disallows\nS&M with non-primary partners. I can certainly understand wanting to reserve that for\nthe primary relationship. I've also heard of polyamorous S&M relationships in which the\npartners can do S&M with outside partners... but won't allow aftercare with outside\npartners. I can understand that even better.\n* * *\nBrainwashing: Intimacy Within Abuse\nIn late 2010, I cross-posted an article about an intense S&M experience to the blog\nFeministe. In the article, I included these words:\nThere it was. I felt the tears building, gasps torn from my throat, I felt myself starting to\nfall apart and reform: around him, around his guidance and force and demands. Almost\nunable to think. Until finally he relented and said my name, and said softly, \"Come\nback,\" and ran his hand reassuringly down my hair.\nThere it was: the reason I want it so much.\nIn response, a commenter named FormerWildChild wrote:\nFor some of us, the idea of being hit by another person makes us want to jump up and\nrun out of our skin. It seriously wigs us out. It is not a moral judgment; is a true phobia\nfor another person. It reminds me of when we were at the un-civilized end of Grand\nCanyon with our children. All that stood between my kids and certain death was inches\nof loosely packed sand. When we were done sightseeing, I discreetly walked behind the\nvan and threw up until I could breathe again.\nI had that same terrified feeling when I read about your account of your last session. I\nwanted to go wrap a blanket around you, hold you in my arms and feed you tea and\ncookies until I can finally breathe again.\nAnd my fear is not because I fail to really \"get\" what you experience. It comes from an\nabsolute recognition of what you describe.\nI have experienced what you described at the end of your BDSM session, the breaking\nand reforming of yourself around someone. I have felt exactly what you are talking\nabout, that feeling of finally letting go, of surrendering, and the other person sensing that\nyou are finally there, and then stopping. I have felt the sweetness of those moments of\npost-thrashing closeness when tenderness seems to hover in the room. I know the feeling\nof intense closeness which can follow the next day. The air is filled with a cathartic\ncleanness, the experience of inflicting pain and of receiving pain has cleared the air\nbetter than any southern thunderstorm. I can even imagine coming to crave that feeling\nin the way that you describe.\nBut I experienced all of those feelings as a child. What you described is precisely what it\nfeels like when an abuser truly lets loose and keeps going until \"it\" breaks, until there is\nthat moment of catharsis for both the beaten and the person doing the beating. In my\nexperience, those relationships are like playing along the end of the Grand Canyon:\npeople fall in, and they die.\nNow, I am willing to believe two things: one, it is possible that my mother and other\nabusers are actually engaged in a form of BDSM rape when they beat the people that\nthey love. Just as sex is the overpowering and taking of something that should be\nbeautiful and intimate, so beating a loved one to catharsis might just be the same sort of\nthing. Perhaps that is something that abuse experts should look at.\nI am also willing to believe that you have an invisible fence as you play along the edge of\nyour own personal Grand Canyon. I am willing to believe that you know how to be there\nwithout falling into the abyss. But if that is the case -- that it is safe for you out there, and\nthat I simply need to accept that. Then I will ask you to accept the fact that I will need to\ngo behind the van and toss my lunch.\nAt first I was frustrated by that comment, because all I could see was someone saying \"I\nwant to throw up when I read about your sexuality,\" and I was like: grrr. But now I look\nat that comment, and I see such important points, points that are utterly crucial to the\ndeveloping language that distinguishes S&M from abuse.\nI will say first that I have never personally survived that kind of abuse. But I have\nreceived emails from people asking me to write about this, over and over, and I hope that\nI can help those folks by offering my thoughts. I have also spoken to some abuse experts\nwho tell me that, behind closed doors, they do talk about this: they discuss how the\nexistence of real desire, real catharsis, and real intimacy within an abusive context can\nlook terrifyingly similar to descriptions of S&M encounters.\nRape survivors of all genders sometimes experience physical pleasure and even orgasm\nwhile being assaulted. A paper about this was published in the 2004 Journal of Clinical\nForensic Medicine, and there are plenty of first-person accounts around the Internet.\nHere's an explicit and tremendously saddening quotation from one of them:\nI kept physically fighting him off and telling him that though I respected him as my pastor\nand as a father figure I wanted him to stop. He pushed me, tore my clothes and raped me.\n... The pain was incredible as they were very rough and forceful. After what seemed like\nforever I blacked out. I remember the pastor shaking me hard and slapping me across the\nface. He then shoved down my throat ten or so Excedrin (a medicinal mixture of pain\nkiller and caffeine) so that I would stay awake.\nOne of the most disturbing things that happened that night is that I had an orgasm.\nDespite years of marriage, it was my first orgasm ever. It really confused me. I thought\nsome part of me must be mentally sick to have experienced the pleasure of an orgasm\nduring this horrific trauma.\nHere's the thing about consent: orgasm is not consent. Physical pleasure is only the\nbody's reaction to certain types of stimulation. Also: sexual desire is not consent. And\nlove isn't consent, either. If I feel sexual desire for my partner, and my body feels good\nwhen he touches me, and I love him, yet I make it clear that I don't want to have sex right\nnow... then he's still violating my consent if he has sex with me. (Obviously, if I want to\nsay \"no\" and mean \"yes,\" then it's my responsibility to negotiate that ahead of time and\nset a safeword.)\nIn short: There can be pleasure, desire, and even love existing alongside real abuse.\nBut that doesn't mean it's not abuse. This is as true with S&M as it is with non-S&M\nsex.\nI once spoke to a person who referred to himself as an abuser, who told me that he'd read\ndescriptions of S&M aftercare, and that he saw his own tactics within them. He told me\nwhen he thought about it, he had always considered it to be \"brainwashing.\"\nAnd I can see it. That's the scary part. I really can see it. I can believe that when we have\npowerful S&M experiences, we tap into the same parts of our brains that could otherwise\nbe used for psychological manipulation and destruction. S&M shows us how to create\nand utilize enormous mental vulnerability through violence... and vulnerability can\nalways be abused. In the literature exploring the cycle of abuse, people often write about\nthe \"reconciliation phase,\" in which the abuser is all sweetness and light to their victim; I\ncan't help but wonder how much of the \"reconciliation phase\" could be recognized as\nnon-consensual aftercare. How much of an abuser's power over their victim might come\nfrom the mental malleability that cautious S&Mers learn to respect?\nThis does not mean that our bodies are broken. The woman whose words I published at\nthe top of this article called it \"the cruelest of design flaws and the worst people\nunderstand it and the most compassionate people don't.\" But we don't have to perceive\nthis as a flaw -- it's not a flaw any more than orgasms are a flaw. Some S&M instructors\ncompare S&M mental states to \"altered states,\" like being drunk; there's nothing wrong\nwith being drunk, but people should be careful with alcohol. Our bodies are instruments\nwith certain powers and vulnerabilities that we must respect.\nThis power and vulnerability is one of the biggest reasons I do the writing that I do.\nBecause although they're invisible, I do have a sense of the fences that FormerWildChild\ntalked about when she commented at Feministe: the fences that keep S&Mers from\nfalling into the Grand Canyon of abuse. Those invisible fences around the canyon are\nconstructed from self-awareness, self-esteem, respect, and consent.\nBuilding Fences Around The Canyon\nHow do we build fences around the canyon? We build them by seeking to understand our\ndesires, and talk openly with our partners, and respect our partners' limits. So I write\nabout communication and self-examination and learning to value my boundaries... and I\nhope it will help people learn what it means to play at the edge, rather than falling into\nthe canyon.\nThis is scary, loaded, complicated territory. I certainly don't have all the answers. But I\nhave ideas on how we might begin finding answers from here.\nFirstly, S&Mers and feminists both need to be aware of this emotional and biological\nphenomenon. It can create a sense of overwhelming intimacy with unexpected partners.\nAnd it can be used as a tool by abusers who groom relationships that started consensually\ninto abusive relationships.\nSecondly, we must keep talking about communication and boundary-setting. An\nimportant part of this discussion is openly discussing what happens when wellintentioned\nS&Mers screw up, and how we deal with that. Again, I wrote about that in\n\"What Happens After an S&M Encounter \"'Gone Wrong.'\" Thomas MacAulay Millar has\na great post that lists the mistakes that can happen within S&M. He mentions, for\nexample, that sometimes there are genuine physical \"technical\" errors; sometimes people\nalso hit \"landmines\" or unexpected psychological problems (I also covered landmines in\nmy post). Talking openly about screwups makes it harder for abusers to claim that they\n\"just screwed up.\"\nThirdly, within our communities, we need to spread the word -- especially to people who\nwe believe might be inexperienced or vulnerable or otherwise in a position to have this\nused against them.\n* * *\nAfter June 16, 2012, this can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/06/16/sm-aftercare-or-brainwashing\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nCOMMUNICATION:\n[theory] Feminist S&M Lessons From the Seduction Community\nThis was originally split into three parts and published in 2011 at GoodMenProject.com.\nObviously, it covers some territory that I also cover in Confessions of a Pickup Artist\nChaser, but the book is much chattier and has more fun anecdotes. Also, you should\ntotally buy the book. Okay, I'll stop advertising it now.\n* * *\nFeminist S&M Lessons From the Seduction Community\nThere is an enormous subculture devoted to teaching men how to seduce women. Within\nthe last half-decade or so, these underground \"pickup artists\" have burst into the popular\nconsciousness, aided by Neil Strauss's bestselling book The Game and VH1's hit reality\nshow The Pick-Up Artist.\nPickup artists -- also known as the \"seduction community\" -- exchange ideas in thousands\nof online fora, using extensive in-group jargon. One pickup artist site lists \"over 715\nterms, and counting.\" There are pickup artist meetups, clubs, and subculture celebrities\nall over the world. There are different ideological approaches and theoretical schools of\nseduction. Well-known pickup artist \"gurus\" can make millions of dollars per year: they\nmay sell books; they may sell hours of \"coaching\"; they may organize training\n\"bootcamps\" or conventions with pricy tickets; they may run companies full of\ninstructors trained in their methods. The community even generates its own well-thoughtout\ninternal critiques.\nI am a sex-positive feminist lecturer and writer. I write primarily about my experiences\nwith sadomasochism, but I have a general interest in sexuality. I first encountered pickup\nartists when smart ones started attending my educational events and commenting on my\nblog.\nSome aspects of pickup artistry are hugely problematic; many parts of the community\nshowcase and encourage misogyny. While exploring the PUA jungle, I observed things\nthat turned my stomach and brought tears to my eyes. On the other hand, I had to admit\nthat some pickup artist perspectives were very interesting. Some had fascinating insights\nabout gender theory and social power. I also felt drawn by their exploits. Learning\nseduction, and watching hypothetically-dazzling Casanovas run a courtier-like game,\nsounded like an extremely fun way to spend my time.\nI started my journey by talking to a few pickup artists and reading their fora. By the end, I\nhad given a lecture at a seduction convention, and I had decided against developing my\nown coaching business. Today, I can offer a quick synopsis of my own history, and why I\nbecame so interested in PUAs. I will break down some elementary distinctions among the\nmen of the seduction community. Finally, I will offer a few PUA-influenced thoughts on\nfeminist goals.\n* * *\nI was an awkward little bookworm of a child, but at least I was creative. I liked to draw,\ninvent games, and run amateur social experiments. When I was in high school, most of\nmy friends were on the Internet; I did not date a real-life boyfriend until college. I was\ninevitably teased by my peers, but even when treated well, I rarely engaged with the\nsocial hierarchies around me. I had difficulty grasping how social mechanics were\n\"supposed\" to work. A lot of things seemed obvious to other people that were not obvious\nto me.\nFor example, in sixth grade, a female friend of mine teased me about flirting with a boy.\n\"What was I doing?\" I asked. \"Come on, you were flirting!\" she responded. While I\nthought I almost understood what she meant, I was unsure -- so I set out to poll everyone\nI knew about what constitutes \"flirting.\" Responses were inconsistent. One person said,\nvery definitely: \"Giggling.\" Others cited examples such as \"intense looks\" or \"making\njokes.\"\nBy the end of this experiment, I concluded that no one seemed able to explain \"flirting\" in\nterms of consistent behaviors; there were few commonalities in my final list. From what I\ncould tell, flirting could only be explained in terms of invisible interpersonal dynamics. I\nfound this both entertaining and frustrating.\nI sometimes wonder what would have become of me if the modern pickup artist\ncommunity had existed back then, and I had discovered it. PUAs devote a lot of time to\nunderstanding seduction in terms of observed behaviors. They have terms for social\ntactics that run the gamut from creating rapport, to encouraging trust, to building sexual\ntension, to shifting social power. But although the purpose of these social tactics is to\nmanipulate emotion, the tactics are typically described as concretely as possible. Some\nPUA coaches provide long memorized \"routines,\" but it is more common to talk about\nparticular social actions or broader strategies.\nOne famous PUA tactic is called the \"neg.\" \"Neg\" stands for \"negative hit,\" and one site\ndefines a neg as \"a remark, sometimes humorous, used to point out a woman's flaws.\"\nLike many PUA terms, the deeper meanings and usage vary from PUA to PUA -- but\nthere is an especially dramatic range of meanings with \"neg.\"\nSome PUAs see negs as friendly teasing: a way for the PUA to show that he is paying\nattention to the girl, without appearing needy or overeager. I can offer a cute example of\nthis approach from my own life. I was sitting in a cafe with a former PUA, and he gazed\ndeep into my eyes.\n\"Wait a minute,\" he said slowly. \"Are your glasses held together by epoxy? It looks like\nyou had to repair them at the corners.\"\n\"Yeah,\" I admitted.\nHe grinned. \"Everything about you just screams 'starving artist,' doesn't it.\"\nThis made me laugh for quite a while. I think it worked because he understood that I have\nchosen (for now) to be a broke writer -- but he also recognized the tension I feel about\nthat choice. So this gentleman was demonstrating that he correctly discerned my\npriorities; that he is not bothered by a choice that makes me feel self-conscious; and that\nhe is confident enough to tease me.\nAlso, at a moment when I thought he might compliment my eyes, the former PUA shook\nup my expectations by breaking the romantic pattern. Often, effective flirting involves\noffering the right mixture of confidence plus charming novelty plus paying attention.\nSome PUAs see negs more strategically, as a way of passing a woman's \"tests\" or\nbreaching her indifference. They argue that this is necessary for women who are very\nhigh-status, very beautiful, etc. They argue that some women develop a kind of immunity\nto compliments, and that some women actively prefer feisty, faux-adversarial flirting.\nMost PUAs only advocate using negs on women who meet a certain \"minimum\" level of\nattractiveness, or who seem particularly feisty. Neil Strauss, a famous PUA and author of\nthe bestseller The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists, once wrote\nthat:\nWhen you give a woman who's often hit on a generic compliment, she will usually either\nignore the remark or assume you're saying it because you want to sleep with her.\nWhen you tease her and show her that you're unaffected by her beauty and demonstrate\nthat you're out of her league -- and THEN let her work to win you over and ultimately\nREWARD her with your approval, she will leave that night feeling good about herself.\nLike something special happened and she connected with somebody who appreciates her\nfor who she REALLY is.\nIn short, a neg will buy you the credibility you need to sincerely compliment her later.\nThat said, I don't necessarily advocate negs; they are in many ways a temporary patch to\nstick onto your personality while you learn to possess real confidence and strength of\ncharacter.\nAlthough this is a manipulative approach, it is not inevitably harmful. It also is not\nlimited to the sphere of sexual relationships; humans often pretend not to care what other\npeople think, and consistently attempt to be taken seriously by others. Additionally, for\nmany people, flirting involves a certain amount of strategic ambiguity and plausible\ndeniability, and negs are a useful tactic for that kind of game. Not everyone likes playing\nsuch tacit and confusing games, but many people do.\nHowever, this is all cute and mild compared to how some PUAs talk about negs: some\ncite the neg specifically as a tactic to make the girl feel bad.\nA well-known PUA who goes by the name of Tyler Durden once wrote that: \"You use\nself-esteem negs to lower the target's self-esteem, and crave your attention to re-validate\nherself.\" Similarly, an especially pitiless PUA blogger who is sometimes described as\n\"the Darth Vader of PUAs\" writes that:\nThe best negs are those which are conceivably meant as compliments, but which linger in\nher psyche for hours afterward, undermining her self-conception and encouraging her to\nqualify herself to you [i.e. encouraging her to explain why she's worth your time].... [A\nneg] infiltrates a girl's subconscious so that she spends more mental energy analyzing\nher worth than she does analyzing yours.\nOne commenter adds to the above blogger's words that: \"So long as you have a woman\nauditioning for you, power remains where it belongs -- squarely in your pocket.\"\nIn other words, a person who feels anxious and unworthy will be easier to control. These\ncruel PUAs have learned the same lesson as thousands of people in abusive relationships.\nHere is an especially instructive quotation from the comments on \"Darth Vader's\" blog:\n\"[Women] really are insipid, vapid airheads. If it wasn't for the pussy, there would be a\nbounty on them.\" That statement is interesting not just because of its hatred but because\nof its fear. After all, no one puts a bounty on targets that are not dangerous. The most\nmisogynist corners of the PUA subculture not only discuss ways to aggressively\nmanipulate women; they also paint women as selfish, deceitful and hazardous.\nThe various approaches to negging highlight both the different shadings of opinion across\nthe subculture, and a particularly important distinction among PUAs themselves. Some of\nthese men genuinely do enter pickup artistry out of a desire to connect to women. As one\nPUA told me, \"When I first looked at PUA stuff, I was like, 'This is so sleazy and gross.'\nBut I'd never had a girlfriend, and I kept telling myself, 'Dude, you are lonely and\nmiserable and you don't want to die alone.'\" On the other hand, many PUAs become\nPUAs because they want unilateral power and control over women -- and many PUAs\nattempt to justify this through narratives and jokes that encourage fear and anger against\nwomen.\n* * *\nAside from the \"connection\" vs. \"control\" distinction, there is also a distinction between\nPUAs who are seeking what is essentially self-help, and those who aren't.\nThe PUA concept that best illustrates this is \"inner game.\" Inner game is, essentially,\ngenuine confidence and sense of purpose. It contrasts with \"outer game\" -- i.e., the things\na PUA says and does to attract women. A \"neg\" would count as \"outer game,\" for\nexample.\nMost successful PUAs reach a point where they decide that, in the words of one coach:\nemotionless \"sport-fucking kinda sucks.\" (Some PUAs start at this point, but that is a bit\nunusual.) They conclude that it's time to pull back from the game; to seek longer-term or\nmore emotionally connected sex; to examine their priorities; and to discover interests\naside from picking up new girls. Finding themselves in this way can be described as\n\"inner game.\" The men who discuss inner game often talk about developing their own\nbusinesses, exercising regularly, keeping a healthier diet, accepting their own\nvulnerabilities, pursuing hobbies, and improving their connections with people of all\ngenders.\nMost PUAs also realize that women respond well to genuine confidence and sense of\npurpose. This could be seen as ironic: notwithstanding the fact that \"inner game\"\nemphasizes self-improvement, the concept is still centered on seducing women.\nHowever, despite the fact that \"inner game\" is centered on gaming ladies, its ultimate\nresult is usually to encourage PUAs to think about what they really want from life. PUA\ncoach Mark Manson once wrote that, \"You don't end up in the Pick Up Artist community\nunless you are incredibly unhappy or unsatisfied about something. It may be conscious, it\nmay be unconscious. It may be short-term, or it may be deep-seated and long-term.\" He\nlater wrote to me by email that: \"This is a giant self-help community in disguise.\" I also\nonce interviewed Neil Strauss himself, who said he hoped that his famous book The\nGame could become \"the beginning of a men's self-help movement -- because self-help\nisn't emasculating anymore if you're doing it to get laid.\"\nInterestingly, Neil Strauss also told me that he agreed with feminism in many ways, and\nsaid things like: \"We still are a patriarchal society.\" Many feminists felt that my interview\nwith him was full of problematic statements, and his words were picked apart by feminist\nreaders. I do not disagree with many feminist critiques of what Strauss said -- but\nconsidering where Strauss was coming from, his words were extraordinarily supportive\nof feminism. One feminist commented to me that, \"I don't understand why you're not\nmore critical of this guy.\" In response, it is worth noting how an anti-feminist writer\nresponded to Strauss's words:\nWhether Strauss is an ignorant fool or an opportunist liar who wants to appease\nfeminists in order to avoid negative feedback is anyone's guess, but if his words are\nanything to go by, we can safely assume that the best-known public advocates of Game\nare perfectly OK with parroting feminist dogma.\nFor the few, mild pro-feminist statements Strauss made, some PUAs deride him as either\nan \"ignorant fool or an opportunist liar.\" (Others hurled particularly misogynist insults\nsuch as \"mangina.\") This is both a demonstration of how vitriolic PUA anti-feminist\nsentiment can become, and an example of the social shaming that sometimes leads men\nin the PUA community to avoid associating themselves with anything resembling\nfeminist thought or woman-friendly perspectives.\nClearly, many men view pickup artistry as a kind of therapy. The community can be a\nsupport group for self-confidence and self-improvement. Unfortunately, many corners of\nthe seduction community are also a support group for virulent misogyny. Some feminists\nargue that any man who seeks self-help through the seduction community is effectively\nembracing misogyny, because so much of the community is misogynist. However, some\nPUA students could be interpreted as seeking self-help from the only avenue they see as\nacceptable, if they are coming from a culture that usually defines self-help as unmasculine\nor anti-masculine. Again, note that Neil Strauss said: \"self-help isn't\nemasculating anymore if you're doing it to get laid.\"\nThe most confusing thing about misogyny among PUAs is that although some moremisogynist\nPUAs separate themselves consciously from non-misogynist PUAs, and vice\nversa, the groups still overlap a great deal. Even PUA-influenced men who prioritize nonmisogyny,\nand are willing to talk to a feminist writer like me, often seem to soak up\nmisogynist ideas from the rest of the subculture. At one point, I talked to one PUA I\nthought was committed to being non-sexist... until he expounded quite seriously upon\nhow his favorite PUA blogger thinks the USA would be better off if women did not vote.\nOne goal of my book, Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser, is to draw clearer lines: to\ngive examples of PUAs and PUA approaches that seem more abusive or inclined towards\nharm, as opposed to approaches that seem mostly playful, harmless or even positive.\n* * *\nAlthough I want to cry when I see statements like, \"If it wasn't for the pussy, there would\nbe a bounty on women,\" I try not to let it distract me from some insights emerging from\nthe seduction community. By focusing empirically and pragmatically on the process of\nsexual escalation, PUAs are approaching gender norms in a way that many people --\nincluding feminists -- usually do not. Also, I can relate to some PUAs because some\nPUAs have the same history of social anxiety that I do.\nI have another personal reason for feeling uncomfortable painting PUAs as \"the enemy.\"\nWhen feminists criticize how PUAs approach sexuality, I have mixed feelings, because I\nmyself am known for sexual desires that are unpopular with some feminists. As I grew\nout of being an awkward little bookworm nerd, as I began dating and exploring my\nsexual needs, I started to understand my sexuality as being heavily involved with BDSM.\nConsensual BDSM is a heavily stigmatized type of sexuality, although some sexologists\nhave argued that it might be viewed as a sexual orientation. Many feminists marginalize\nBDSM just as much as the rest of society does -- or more. Famous German feminist Alice\nSchwarzer once said: \"Female masochism is collaboration,\" and a recent history of Ms.\nMagazine quotes a co-founding editor who recalls that:\nI threatened to leave over a manuscript by a woman who was a former editor of ours\nwho was writing about why she was a masochist and trying to make it an okay choice. I\nwould rather leave than work for a magazine that published that. And we didn't publish\nit.\nAs a result, notwithstanding my considerable feminist writing and activism, I live in fear\nof my \"feminist card\" being revoked because of my BDSM identity.\nYet, simultaneously, my practice of BDSM has greatly informed my feminist\nunderstanding. Rape and consent are both very important feminist issues, and much of\nthe BDSM community obsessively examines sexual consent. The dominant BDSM\ncommunity \"mantra\" is \"SSC: Safe, Sane, and Consensual.\" Some people debate whether\nanother \"mantra\" would be better, but I have never heard of someone removing the\n\"consensual\" part. Indeed, the ways many BDSMers think of sexual consent overlap\ndramatically with the ways that many feminists think of it.\nSafewords are a famous and high-profile example of careful BDSM communication\ntactics. They are specific code words that any participant can use to stop the sexual action\nat any time. Safewords are important in a context where one partner might want to\nscream \"No!\" or \"Please don't!\" or \"Mercy!\" with no intention of actually stopping the\naction.\nSafewords serve another, stealthier, but equally important function: they bring home the\nidea that consent is a continuously changing process. Consent is part of the ongoing\nsexual negotiation that takes place between two people. Here, BDSM consent ideas\noverlap heavily with feminist consent ideas. For example, one article by high-profile\nfeminist Jaclyn Friedman pushes back against dominant conceptions of consent by stating\nthat \"consent is not a lightswitch.\" As Friedman writes:\nSexual consent isn't like a lightswitch, which can be either \"on,\" or \"off.\" It's not like\nthere's this one thing called \"sex\" you can consent to anyhow. \"Sex\" is an evolving series\nof actions and interactions. You have to have the enthusiastic consent of your partner for\nall of them. And even if you have your partner's consent for a particular activity, you\nhave to be prepared for it to change.\nSafewords are, effectively, a constant reminder that \"you have to be prepared for\n[consent] to change.\"\nBDSMers and feminists tend to teach explicit, straightforward verbal sexual\ncommunication -- in contrast to the seduction community, which typically teaches nonverbal\nor playfully tacit sexual communication. For example, the seduction community\nhas an extensive array of discussions about how to initiate flirtatious touching, which\nPUAs refer to as \"kino.\" The seduction community also places a strong emphasis on\ndeveloping skill at reading a social situation without asking exactly what is going on; if a\nPUA is good at understanding implicit social signals, he is described as \"calibrated.\"\nFor BDSMers and feminists, the sexual consent territory continues to overlap after\nsafewords. Huge factions, if not majorities, within both groups have concluded that the\nbest way to encourage consent is not merely to encourage people to understand that they\ncan withdraw consent at any point -- but to encourage open communication and selfknowledge\nabout sex.\nAmong feminists, an example of this approach is Jaclyn Friedman's brand-new book\nWhat You Really, Really Want: The Smart Girl's Shame-Free Guide to Sex and Safety.\nSalon's Tracy Clark-Flory notes in an interview with Friedman that:\nThe book is filled with writing exercises that prompt readers to reflect on everything from\nbody image to sexual assault. It's essentially a guide to writing one's own personal sexual\nmanifesto.\nAmong BDSMers, an example of this approach is the multi-page checklists that some\nBDSMers use. (I already wrote about this in my piece \"Sex Communication Tactic\nDerived From S&M: Checklists,\" reprinted earlier in this book; just in case you haven't\nread it, I'll briefly describe them.) Checklists are essentially lists of every conceivable\nBDSM-related act; each act on the checklist looks something like this:\nFLOGGING -- GIVING __________________ O O O O O\nFLOGGING -- RECEIVING ______________ O O O O O\nEach partner rates each entry by filling out 1-5 bubbles, with 1 darkened bubble meaning\n\"Not interested\" and 5 bubbles meaning \"I crave this!\" This type of explicit\ncommunication is both an excellent way to help partners understand each other's desires\n-- and to help partners understand each other's boundaries. In a way, this sort of thing\ncould be seen as \"Master Class\" consent communication.\nThis was the context whence I emerged when I started investigating pickup artistry. I am\na feminist, but I'm a flavor of feminist with a troubled history within the movement. I am\nan advocate for explicit communication, but I believe that no aspect of consent should be\nignored, and I am concerned that many feminists and BDSMers give a certain\nunwarranted privilege to explicit verbal communication over implicit or non-verbal\ncommunication.\nPeople seem likely to develop a preference for explicit communication if it seems more\nnecessary. For instance, many BDSMers develop a preference for explicit communication\nbecause our desires are unusual and precise, and complicated words will help us get what\nwe want. Feminists develop the same preferences because explicit communication is the\nclearest way to ensure sexual consent. Accordingly, some people attempt to promote\nexplicit sexual communication by saying: We should make it necessary.\nHere's an example exchange from the comments on a thoughtful feminist BDSM blog. A\nmale commenter asks:\nI once had an argument with a very good female friend of mine about kissing. She was\nperturbed about a date who asked her if he could proceed to kiss her. She said the man\nshould just know. It should be instinctual and u lose the moment as soon as u ask. I said\nthat was bs, the first move is one of the most nerve wracking things, the very fact that he\nasked shows his politeness and tact and frankly a lack of presumptuousness.... What do\nyou think? What's the line between politeness and passivity?\nThe feminist blogger, an intelligent and awesome lady who goes by the name Holly\nPervocracy, responds that:\nI don't say this very often, but \"you lose the moment as soon as you ask\" girls really are\nruining it for the rest of us.\nAs far as I'm concerned, they can go without ever being kissed until they wise up.\nHowever, I think (or would like to think? augh) that most girls are not like that, and that\nyou should not plan for girls to be like that. I'd definitely rather offend someone by\nasking than offend them by not asking.\nHolly implies that people who don't like explicit communication should effectively be\nbanned from kissing: she says, \"they can go without ever being kissed until they wise\nup.\" I have a certain cantankerous sympathy for this perspective, and I have said similar\nthings myself in the past. But my research into pickup artists made me wonder about\nwhether this perspective is tenable, given a world in which most people seem to enjoy\nand engage in a great deal of tacit communication.\nSpeaking only for myself, I must admit that I like it when a man can read my unspoken\nsignals well enough that he can tell when to kiss me without asking aloud. Sometimes it\ncan be nice when a guy asks. But if he can read my tacit communication about kissing,\nthat is a signal that he can read a lot of my other tacit communication as well.\nFurthermore, if many people really enjoy unspoken social games and strategic\nuncertainty, then \"the game\" will never go away. Evidence that people enjoy those things\ndoes not only include the pickup artist subculture -- romantic comedies and romance\nnovels consistently find a market, after all.\nAdditionally, part of improving sexual communication means learning more about\nunspoken communication -- not just spoken communication. The pioneering social\neconomist Peter F. Drucker once said, \"The most important thing in communication is to\nhear what isn't being said.\" This maxim is no less true when it comes to sex than it is in\nany other area of human endeavor. PUAs have spent years gathering information on tacit\nsexual communication, so perhaps one feminist goal should be to try and understand what\nthey've learned, such as the characteristics of excellent social \"calibration.\"\nSome feminists and BDSMers exist who already think a lot about teaching implicit or\nunspoken communication. On the feminist side, one webpage about sexual violence\nfeatures an image of a woman saying: \"I stopped kissing you back. I pushed your hand\naway. I said I wanted to leave. It all meant 'NO'.\" On the BDSM side, there is often an\nexpectation that BDSM partners will discuss their experience and reactions once they are\ndone doing BDSM with each other, so as to learn more about how to read each other's\ntacit signals. However, I have never encountered a BDSM seminar on the topic of nonverbal\ncommunication, though I've attended several on verbal communication.\nMy perspective on non-verbal communication is not without precedent among feminist\nBDSMers, though my willingness to deal extensively with PUAs might be. Still, I believe\nthat non-verbal communication is not taught well, and that feminists and BDSMers in\nparticular do not spend enough time discussing its role in sexual interactions. Given that\nboth communities emphasize that consent and communication are crucially intertwined,\nperhaps both communities might draw insight from some PUA conceptions of \"kino,\"\n\"calibration\" and other ways of examining implicit communication.\nI once started a thread about pickup artists on a major feminist blog, to which one\nfeminist responded: \"I'm getting so sick of these PUA threads.... So I'll just come out and\nsay it: PUAs rape women through coercion and manipulation. Full stop.\"\nThere are a lot of things about pickup artistry that I really do not like. There were points\nduring my PUA adventures when I learned about incidents and strategies that blatantly\nsound like rape. This is a huge can of worms, and I discussed it at great length in my\nbook. For now I will only note that there is an entire PUA area of inquiry called \"Last\nMinute Resistance\" (or \"LMR\"): that is, what happens when a woman resists having sex.\n\"Last Minute Resistance tactics\" (\"LMR tactics\") are designed to convince a woman who\nhas expressed hesitance, distaste or discomfort to have sex anyway.\n\"The first two 'no's don't mean much, and should be expected,\" advises one PUA while\noutlining LMR tactics. This is exactly the kind of thing that gives the community a bad\nname. In fairness, some PUAs talk about trying to understand why a girl is\nuncomfortable, and then addressing the root cause of her discomfort. For example, a PUA\nmight advise asking whether she is menstruating, and then reassuring her that he won't be\ngrossed out by having sex if she is. Some PUAs try to claim that most LMR tactics are\nharmless and communicative, but this is a difficult claim to defend. I have always been\nmore impressed by the few PUAs who simply advocate respecting Last Minute\nResistance, such as David Shade:\nDo not push against last minute resistance. You will be like all the other guys who\nobjectify women and do not respect her as a real person. And it will reek of desperation.\n... In fact, move things along just slightly slower than she'd like it. Make her wait. It\nbuilds that sexual tension, and it makes her think. When she is away from you, she is\ngoing to think about it a lot.\nOf course, while Shade is advising his clients to respect boundaries, he's advising them to\nrespect boundaries as a tactic for seducing the woman eventually. Another example of\nthis approach comes from Mark Manson, who appears more interested in respecting\nwomen for the sake of respecting women, but whose main thrust is still seduction advice:\nIn [an LMR situation], there's always a fork in the road: you can do the typical freezeout/high-pressure\nPUA bullshit to try to manipulate her or annoy her into giving up the\nresistance. Or you can be honest about the situation and resign yourself to accepting the\nfact that you may not have sex tonight.\nGuys, listen. Always, always, always go with the second option. It may sound counterintuitive,\nbut you have to go with the second option. Not only because it's the right thing\nto do. Not only because it's what any respectful human being should do. But because if\nyou make it clear that there is absolutely no pressure for her to sleep with you, if you\nshow her that you can be trusted and that you're OK with whatever she decides (and by\nthe way, you do need to be OK with whatever she decides), then she's going to become\nten times more comfortable with you, and therefore is actually more likely to WANT to\nhave sex with you.\nPUA frameworks and tactics are often consent-friendly. Many \"LMR tactics\" encourage\npushiness or even outright non-consensual behavior, such as ignoring the woman when\nshe says, \"No.\" Yet things I discussed in previous sections of this article – such as \"negs,\"\nand body-language \"kino\" tactics -- are clearly neutral: their usage is shaped mostly by\nthe goals of individual PUAs and the social context in which they occur. Discussions of\nsocial \"calibration\" -- increasing one's capacity to read social situations -- as well as\n\"inner game\" and being attractive by improving oneself will generally be a positive good.\nIndeed, it could be argued that no PUA tactics are inherently abusive, but some are more\nobviously susceptible to being used badly... the same way a sword is more obviously\nsusceptible to evil usage than a table.\nPrevious feminist writers have usually preferred to complain about the seduction\ncommunity's misogyny rather than examining the community deeply. I have been more\ninterested to see whether I could understand and make use of the positive PUA theories.\nUnderstanding the \"Darth Vader\" types might be useful, too. There is a percentage of\nPUAs who are non-consensually hurting women, and if we learn how those men do it, we\nmight also figure out how to disarm them.\nI must acknowledge that I eventually felt that the community was damaging, poisonous,\nand unhealthy for me -- to the extent that I needed to get out and detox. (PUA detox is a\nrecognized phenomenon even among some PUAs... and former PUAs.) However, there\nare truths within it that are both intriguing and important.\nI have never quite erased my fear of having my \"feminist card\" revoked, although it is not\nclear how \"feminists\" -- a fractious group if ever there was one -- could withdraw my\npresence in the movement. There is no Central Standards Bureau for feminists. Perhaps\ninevitably, the feminist reaction to Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser was quite\nmixed... although some other feminists appear to agree that there are important and\ninteresting things to learn from PUAs about gender, culture, and feminist consent models.\nAn overall lesson here might be that thinkers with a lot in common are increasingly\nisolated from each other through the accelerating Balkanization of detailed, insular,\ninterest-based subcultures. Like the drive towards interdisciplinary research in academia,\nperhaps a kind of interdisciplinary subcultural approach is being developed by those of us\nmore interested in building bridges than burning them.\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/02/27/feminist-sm-lessons-from-the-seductioncommunity/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nS&M:\n[storytime] The Strange Binary of Dominance and Submission\nI wrote this in early 2012, and it was originally published at RoleReboot.org. If I had to\nsummarize my relationship with this gentleman today, then ironically enough, I'd say that\n\"it got complicated and I'm pretty sure it's over now.\" I still like this piece, though.\n* * *\nThe Strange Binary of Dominance and Submission\nIt's been a while since I felt simultaneously very into someone, and very sure about him.\nIt's a strange feeling. I've been playing with theories about how \"flirtation is basically an\nexercise in strategic ambiguity\" and \"insecurity is an integral part of romantic\nintoxication\" and \"uncertainty is an emotional amplifier,\" and I do think that those ideas\nare true in many ways. But I got so wrapped up in theory that I forgot how it feels to be\nway into someone... and only a little bit scared.\n* * *\nI met Mica at a Saturday night party. When I left the next morning, he said he wanted to\nsee me again as soon as possible. \"Monday?\" he asked. \"Tuesday?\"\n\"Monday,\" I said. \"Tomorrow.\"\nHe's a smart, creative thinker. There are layers to him, and he practically shines: so why\nnot name him for the mineral Mica? I would love talking to him for those reasons alone.\nBut there's also a kind of certainty to him; a calm presence; an extraordinary quality of\nattention. Once he's focused on a partner, there's a rhythm behind everything he does.\nHe's so precise that when I'm kissing him, I feel like an awkward puppy.\nI observed this very quickly, and something else: that the quality of his attention -- often\novertook him. Controlled him. In a sexual interaction, it's difficult to distract him from\ncatering to me. And since he's excellent at reading my desires, I usually don't want to\ndistract him.\nIt made me think of what I was like, years ago, before I understood my submissive\ntendencies. Mica hadn't done much explicit S&M before, and when he'd done it, he was\ndominant. I didn't want to project too much, or make any assumptions about him... but I\ncouldn't help noticing.\nThe second night I was with him, I asked him to inflict light pain on me. Very light. I\ndidn't want to go further with him, yet. But his instincts for delivering pain and watching\nmy reactions were, as I suspected, beautifully calibrated.\nThe third night I was with him, he touched my face and kissed me. I felt my eyelashes\nflutter and my body melt, and he smiled. Then he said, \"I'm feeling really gentle tonight. I\ndon't know how much I'm up for.\"\nHe doesn't want S&M right now, I thought. Sometimes guys date me and get anxious that\nI'll be disappointed when they don't want to do S&M. This is understandable, given that\nI'm an S&M writer. But I hate that, because the last thing I want is for one of my partners\nto feel obligated... and besides, even I don't want all-S&M-all-the-time. I smiled directly\ninto Mica's eyes and told him I was fine with it.\nIn bed, I watched him. Watched his extraordinary attentiveness. Eventually we got to a\npoint where I was leaning over him, kissing him. I watched him give up his body to the\nkiss. He doesn't want S&M right now, I thought... except that his main experience with\nS&M, so far, is being in charge.\n\"Do you trust me?\" I asked him.\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Absolutely.\"\nI clenched my nails into Mica's side, and his back arched. It was the clearest invitation I'd\nseen from him and, I suspected, the clearest invitation he knew how to give. If he even\nknew that he was giving it. It can take a lot of time and experience for a submissive to\nlearn what they want well enough to give good feedback for it. It's one of those\nsubmissive skills that people don't think about enough, because for some reason we're\nalways too busy teaching dominant skills.\nI kissed Mica again, and tore into his back.\nHe was ready for it. His breathing fast became irregular; he gasped; he shook in my\nhands. After a while, I pulled back and simply observed the intensity flooding through\nhim. His body undulated like a wave.\n\"I knew you were dangerous,\" he breathed. \"In exactly the way that I want.\"\n\"Dangerous,\" I repeated. I hesitated. \"What do you mean?\" His eyelashes flickered, and I\nsaw that he was too far under to answer me. He probably barely knew what he was\nsaying. (In S&M, we call this state of mind subspace.)\nI pushed him a little farther. I only used my nails, but you can do a lot with your nails. I\nsaid his name, over and over. He struggled, he fought his own body. I observed the\nstruggle and saw myself in it. \"I know,\" I told him.\nEventually Mica said, quite seriously, that he wanted to stop. I was certain that he could\ntake more. A lot more. I might have been able to convince him to continue, and had him\nthank me for it later. But he needs to know that I'll respect him when he says to stop.\nAlso, in a somewhat self-interested way, I don't want to set a precedent where his\nboundaries are entirely nonverbal; where his limits depend on my capacity to see through\nhim. Maybe someday, when we know each other really well. Right now, it would make it\ntoo easy to seriously harm him... and for him to hate me afterwards.\nSo I stopped.\n\"No one has ever touched me so deeply, so fast before,\" Mica said, later. And, later later:\n\"This changes everything.\" I lay still, kept my arms around him, listening. \"That was\ntotal catharsis,\" he said. \"I mean --\" a note of doubt crept into his voice. \"Do you actually\nlike doing that?\"\n\"Yes,\" I said. I said it fast and hard, because he needs to believe it. I understood why he\nwas asking: I've been there. When I was first getting into S&M, the first time I felt that\nway, I had a hard time believing that my partner actually liked doing that for me. It felt so\nincredible. It felt like I couldn't possibly be giving back as much as I received.\nSometimes, I still feel that insecurity.\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" Mica said. I felt his body relax next to mine. \"Because I'm going to\nwant that again.\"\n\"I know,\" I said softly.\nI tried not to be afraid. Not only because I like him so much, and it's easy to be afraid.\nBut because someone like Mica, who wants so much to give, can be seriously damaged\nby a partner who isn't careful to offer him space to be exactly who he is.\nAnd, most of all, because S&M is a complex and fickle mistress. Because I knew that if\nMica expected me to be able to do that regularly, he was bound to be disappointed. His\ntendencies are there, and I can learn them, but this one \"total catharsis\" depended on a\nconfluence of factors: there had been something close to his surface, something he'd\npractically begged me to pull out, and it had been his first time.\nPlus, S&M also depends on self-maintenance and reasonable expectations and respecting\nour own failures. An S&M relationship will be much less stable if the people involved\ncan't accept imperfection.\nI was scared, scared, scared that Mica believed me to be more amazing than I could ever\npossibly be.\n* * *\nThe next day, Mica was thrilled by his scratches, and showed them off to me. I was\npleased by how he eroticized the marks -- I do that, too -- but I also felt a moment of\npiercing guilt. \"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I should have been more careful, before leaving marks\nlike that. I should have asked.\"\nMica met my eyes directly, insistently. \"No,\" he said. \"Don't be sorry. Last night was\namazing. You knew exactly where I needed to go.\"\nI pushed back my fear -- he expects too much of me -- and answered quietly. I ended by\ntelling him, \"S&M can't be that, all the time.\" He nodded. I hoped he was listening.\nFortunately, he was. The next time we did it, Mica was slightly disappointed that it wasn't\nmind-blowing -- as I knew he would be. But he dealt with it. He articulated the\ndisappointment to me, and he remembered that I'd warned him, and he said that he was\nprepared to take things as they came. And then, lying on his side next to me, watching\nme, he asked: \"Do you want pain?\"\nI felt my eyes widen. I felt a spike of fear. I was already so into him. I knew that if I\nallowed him to get me to subspace, there'd be no going back.\n\"Yes,\" I said.\nAnd again, that attention. In a way, sometimes, Mica's attentiveness can be strangely\ninconvenient. He's almost over-attuned to my desires. Even when I tell him to close his\neyes, he can't lose himself that way; he can't make himself keep them closed. The quality\nof his attention is, however, quite remarkable when he hurts me.\n\"This is where you could take me apart,\" I said afterwards, as I surfaced out of that\nterrible vulnerability.\nMica looked at me, rested his head on me. \"I just want to take care of you,\" he said.\n* * *\nWhen I was younger, it took me a while to get around to taking the dominant role. And\nthere's still something I can reach when I'm being submissive and masochistic that I've\nnever reached when I'm dominant. Still, I think of myself as a confirmed switch now:\nsomeone who can take either the submissive or dominant role. Yet it's such a strange\nbinary, isn't it? If he rips me apart and then says, \"I just want to take care of you,\" then\nwhich of us is in charge?\nMica told me recently that, \"When you're hurting me, my favorite thing you say is 'I\nknow.' Because you do know. You know exactly what it's like.\"\nBy now I'm barely scared. It hasn't been that long, and I'm trying to allow for New\nRelationship Energy. I know this could still go up in smoke. But we've talked about\nexpectations, and we've talked through what we're both looking for, and we're both\nthinking of each other in a long-term way.\nIf I had to point to events that \"proved\" Mica has serious potential, two things would top\nthe list. First, in the aftermath of his first incredible S&M experience, when he dealt with\nthe disappointment of realizing that S&M can't always be that -- dealt with it quietly,\nsensibly, without drama, by talking to me. And second, when he said, in defiance of most\naggressive stereotypical dominant roles: \"I just want to take care of you.\"\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/02/10/storytime-the-strange-binary-of-dominanceand-submission/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nFEMINISM:\n[storytime] My Mom's Rape Story, and A Confused Relationship With\nFeminism\nI wrote this in 2012, for Mother's Day. It was originally published at the girl-power site\nOffOurChests.com.\n* * *\nMy Mom's Rape Story, and A Confused Relationship With Feminism\nMy mother is a rape survivor. In 1970, when she was in her twenties, she came home\nalone one day with the groceries. As she was opening the door, a man came up behind\nher and forced her into the apartment, where he violently assaulted her. For years\nafterwards, my mother had Rape Trauma Syndrome -- a type of Post-Traumatic Stress\nDisorder that affects rape survivors -- but neither RTS nor PTSD had yet been identified,\nand psychiatrists didn't know what to do with her.\nLater in the decade, my mother dumped one of her boyfriends. He then came to her\napartment one night, broke in, and raped her. As he got in bed, she was in the middle of a\nflashback. She cried and said \"No,\" and he had sex with her anyway. When she tried to\ntell him later that what he'd done was unacceptable, he informed her that because she'd\npursued him during their relationship -- because she was the one who originally asked\nhim out -- a rape case would never stand up in court.\nMy mother met my dad many years after these incidents. Mom first told me that she'd\nbeen raped in my late teens, because she was considering telling her story to our church\ncongregation, and she wanted me to know before she did that. The full stories came out\nduring intermittent conversations in my twenties. I love both my parents with the fire of a\nthousand suns, and let me tell you, I've spent an unreasonable amount of time fantasizing\nabout murdering the men who attacked my mother. I doubt I could find the first guy, but I\ncould probably find the second, and in my early twenties I often imagined shooting him\nin the head. (Don't worry, Mom, I don't think about that anymore.)\nWithin the last few years, I started thinking about asking Mom's permission to write\nabout her experiences and my reaction to them. I always shelved the idea because I felt\nthat it wasn't my story to tell. Last year, the topic came up in conversation, and I finally\nasked permission; she said yes immediately. I double-checked her consent twice this\nyear, and she said yes both times. Still, I was hesitant, and I only got around to it now --\nfor Mother's Day. I also asked her to review this piece, and to feel free to veto anything\nwithin it.\nI am doing my best not to co-opt or appropriate my mother's story. But her story and her\nlife have shaped mine, intimately -- including my views on gender issues, and my course\nas a feminist activist and writer. A few years ago, a widely-read Harper's article by\nestablished feminist Susan Faludi asserted that the relationship between younger\nfeminists and older feminists is like a battle between girls and our moms. I read the\narticle with interest, but also with a sense of displacement. As a teenager I fought with\nmy mom all the time, but she and I rarely argue anymore, and we never argue about\nissues of feminism or sexuality at all. If \"young\" feminism is about rebelling against our\nmothers, then I missed that boat completely.\nIn fairness, my mom's not easy to rebel against. When I was 15, I asked her what she'd do\nif I ran off with a Hell's Angel. She laughed. \"I'd probably be jealous,\" she said.\n* * *\nI started blogging in 2008 because I wanted to write about sexuality, particularly S&M.\nHowever, I identified myself as a feminist from the start, because I wanted to make it\nobvious that S&M and feminism are not mutually exclusive. The conflicts of feminism\nand S&M have been a major theme throughout the Feminist Sex Wars. I tend to repeat\nmyself when I write about this, so I'll just mention my favorite quotation on the matter; it\ncomes from the German radical feminist Alice Schwarzer, who said, \"Female masochism\nis collaboration!\"\nWhen I came out of the closet to my mom, I had been freaking out about my S&M\nidentity for a while -- but quietly. I told my parents about my sexuality because I wanted\nto go into therapy, but I wanted a Kink Aware therapist who wouldn't shame me for my\nS&M preferences. The specific therapist I preferred was out-of-network for my health\ninsurance, which meant I needed help paying for it. My dad was cool with it, but he didn't\nsay much. My mother paused when I told her... and then she explained that S&M is part\nof her sexuality, too.\nI was shocked. I was also incredibly relieved. If my brilliant, independent mother was\ninto S&M, then suddenly I felt much more okay about being into it myself. It turned out\nthat she had explored S&M late in life -- and she went through the same anxiety about\nfeminism and S&M that I'd felt. \"You're not giving up your liberation,\" she told me.\nMom also acknowledged the stereotype that S&M arises from abusive experiences. \"I\nonce worried that being raped made me into S&M,\" she said. \"But I remember having\nS&M feelings in my childhood and early teens, long before I was raped. I was like this all\nalong.\" When she said that, I caught my breath in recognition.\nThis is another topic I often repeat myself about, but that's because it's important. As it\nhappens, the biggest and best-designed study on S&M found that there is no correlation\nbetween abusive experiences and being into S&M. There's also plenty of anecdotal\nevidence within the S&M community that a lot of S&Mers, though not all, feel our S&M\nidentities to be innate (sometimes described as an \"orientation\"). This is not to say that\nthere's anything wrong with understanding or processing abuse through consensual S&M.\nThe psychologist Peggy Kleinplatz once published a scholarly article called \"Learning\nFrom Extraordinary Lovers: Lessons From The Edge,\" which discusses how therapists\ncan help their clients by studying alternative sexualities. Kleinplatz included a case study\nof a couple whose S&M experiences helped them process their histories of abuse.\nHowever, abusive experiences should not be seen as the usual \"creator\" of S&M desires.\n(For more on this, check out my article on S&M and the psychiatric establishment.)\nThe stereotype that S&M \"comes from\" abuse is another reason I worried about writing\nthis article. Basically, this is a prettily-wrapped gift to Internet commentators who enjoy\nwriting posts or hate mail about how fucked up I am, or about how dysfunctional S&M\nis. I guess there's no help for that.\n* * *\n\"I'm fascinated that you've adopted feminism so thoroughly,\" my mother told me once. \"I\nnever felt like I was into feminism like you are.\"\n\"What?\" I said. \"Are you serious?\"\n\"Well, feminism shaped my life,\" she said. \"I really had my consciousness raised by\nsome of my experiences. Not just being raped, but by other things, like seeing the anger\nand resentment among my mother and her sisters. Feminism helped me understand how\nwomen compete and put each other down because we're put in that position by men who\nhave power over us. Sometimes, we're like animals who have been starved into fighting\nfor scraps.\n\"But,\" my mother continued, \"I've never been sure about calling myself a feminist. There\nhave always been a lot of feminist areas I didn't feel welcome. Your dad was a card-\ncarrying member of the National Organization for Women when I met him, and I refused\nto join. We used to joke about it. And you remember that recent article about the history\nof Ms. Magazine you emailed me? In the article, Gloria Steinem says that anyone could\nhave walked into the Ms. office in the 1970s and gotten a job. But I certainly never felt\nlike I could do that. I was actually living in New York when Ms. started, and I was even\nworking in publishing... but I grew up on a farm in the midwest, and I wasn't like the\nwomen who ran Ms. They felt like a club.\"\nMy upbringing has not been like my mother's. I grew up with a lot more privilege; my\nmother used to call me a spoiled \"princess\" when she was angry, and one of my exboyfriends\nused to tease me by calling me \"East Coast Intellectual.\" Yet in a lot of ways,\nit took me a while to get into feminism, too. Gender issues have always been a strand of\nmy thinking, but plenty of feminist discourse never impressed me. In university, I felt\nlike everything I heard from feminism was a tortured conspiracy theory. And although I\nidentified as \"feminist\" from the very beginning of blogging, it was out of a sense of\nresistance rather than feeling included. I felt like: Goddamnit, I will show you that I can\nbe an independent and rational woman who values voting and abortion rights and equal\nopportunity and consent -- and be into S&M at the same damn time.\nAs I kept writing, I was looking at other blogs about gender and sexuality, too. The ones\nwhose analysis really spoke to me were usually feminist blogs. And those were also,\noften, the bloggers who noticed me in return. My work was highlighted by a number of\nfeminist writers who wanted to raise my profile. Talking to them, I began to understand\nsome sophisticated critiques that I'd previously labeled \"conspiracy theories.\" I expanded\nmy understanding of topics like rape culture, as well as \"tangential\" social justice issues\nlike race and class. My mother said to me, long afterwards: \"Feminism really reached out\nand grabbed you, didn't it.\"\nIn 2011, I heard from a feminist friend about organizations that train volunteer advocates\nfor rape survivors. In Chicago and many other cities, when people who have been raped\ngo to the emergency room, the hospital will ask if they want an advocate. The advocate's\nrole is to provide immediate crisis counseling and to help the survivor deal with\ncomplexities of the medical and legal system. The minute I heard about advocacy, I knew\nI wanted to do it.\nIn 1970, my mother didn't have an advocate, for the simple reason that advocates did not\nyet exist. Rape Trauma Syndrome was first recognized by feminists in the 1970s, and\nassault advocacy was developed by feminists during that time as well.\nI told Mom all about the advocacy curriculum while I was completing it, and she drank\nup every detail. \"I never got support like that,\" she said. \"My boyfriend insisted that we\ngo to the emergency room, and I guess he tried to advocate for me, but the doctors and\nnurses ignored me for 20 hours and then sent me home. It was worse that the nurses did.\nIf sisterhood was powerful, then couldn't they reach out to me somehow?\" (Rape\nsurvivors -- at least in Illinois -- are now prioritized in emergency rooms, second only to\nlife-and-death situations.)\nMom often regales me with tales about how things used to be. For example, when she\nbecame editor of her college newspaper in the 1960s, all the dudes on staff quit because\nthey wouldn't work under a woman. (Some returned later, rather sheepishly.) Other\nfavorites have to do with menstruation. It turns out that back in the day, doctors – who\nwere of course always male -- simply refused to accept the existence of PMS.\nApparently, it was accepted among doctors that a woman who felt cramps while\nmenstruating was \"making it up.\" (Female nurses who attempted to describe the actual\nfeeling were ignored.) It was understood that a woman who felt unusually emotional or\neven in physical pain while menstruating was just being moody and hysterical. (You\nknow how women are!) As more women became doctors and feminism gained traction\nand science advanced with a broader perspective and scientists discovered the actual\nphysical causes of cramps, PMS became recognized as a real thing. Cramps were no\nlonger \"typical female hysteria.\"\nWhich, of course, makes it all the more ironic that PMS is now often used as an excuse to\ndiscount women as hysterical. It makes me laugh, in my cynical way.\nIt's kind of astonishing that a woman like my mother would disclaim a strong connection\nwith feminism. And yet she does.\n* * *\nThis year I had my first Full-On Internet Feminist Scandal, during which I received hate\nmail and hate comments from other feminists. (I name the event in capital letters because\nemail from other feminists, some of whom I don't even know, has told me that if you\nstick with Internet Feminism long enough, it's basically inevitable that you obtain one of\nthese.) The worst of it fell on a holiday when I was visiting my mother. Mom was helping\nout at church, and wanted me to attend the sermon. I sobbed for hours before leaving\nhome; I managed to make it to church, but I was such a wreck when I got there that she\nput me in a back room so I could be alone to cry.\nTo be clear, I definitely think that I've screwed up on some social justice issues in the\npast, and I'm sure that I will in the future. I am doing my best to keep myself honest and\nwork on the areas where I've been called out. That's a crucial part of social justice work,\nand it's one I try to take seriously.\nBut I have to tell you, the piece I wrote that drew the biggest backlash was one that my\nmother loved. (In the interests of accountability, I'll say that I do think a lot of the\ncritiques are valid and important, like this one for example -- and, for those in the\naudience who are familiar with feminist call-out culture, I recommend a couple insightful\ncomments from a brilliant Feministe commenter named saurus.) When I wrote the initial\ndraft, I felt so uncertain that I asked Mom to review it, and she said: \"I think this is one of\nthe best things you've ever written.\" Yet one key factor in many of these critiques is that I\nfailed to make enough space for rape survivors. I plan to write differently about the topic\nin the future, but there's real irony in the fact that the most important rape survivor in my\nlife believes that one of my best pieces is the same one that got me hate mail for failing\nrape survivors. (Of course, I also received incredibly personal comments about my sex\nlife. The Feminist Sex Wars ain't over yet.)\nMom and I discussed it later, of course. She read some of the commentary online, and she\ncame back shaking her head. \"The things some feminists are saying about you really\nfloored me,\" she said. \"But I'm not completely surprised. Feminism has always been one\nof those movements that eats its young. That's one reason I never identified with it. I\nthink there are a lot of people my age who started out living feminist lives, who now\nwouldn't be caught dead calling themselves feminist. Women who had careers, who\nraised sensitive, loving sons and strong daughters... who find the baggage of the 'feminist'\nlabel distasteful.\"\nI've thought a lot about my mother's comment that feminism \"eats its young.\" One 2009\nNew Yorker article about feminism by Ariel Levy offered an interesting analysis of\nfeminist divisions, but included one offhand claim that isn't explained or justified:\n\"Revolutions are supposed to devour their young.\" Is that so? Nobody told me. (Perhaps\nironically, Levy presents this claim while stating that feminism has actually turned\nagainst its elders.)\nSome commentators have told me that if I can't take the heat, then I just shouldn't write\nabout feminism. It hurts to think it, but maybe they're right. Somehow, the idea of being\n\"a good feminist\" has become utterly tangled up in my identity. It's a weak spot and a\nsore spot, in a way that I didn't anticipate and don't fully understand. I find social justice\ncriticism to be nourishing when it's generous and constructive, sometimes even when it's\naggressive -- but sometimes it feels so incredibly destructive. But as I said, I'm not at all\nthe only feminist writer who feels that the community can be internally destructive. How\nmuch of the problem is the vitriol within some critiques, and how much is that feminism\nhas become \"who we are\" rather than \"something we do\"?\nI think we can all agree that it's good to call out other people when they're screwing up --\nbut there has to be a way for us to build a movement without eating our young. Yet from\nwhat my mother tells me, we've never been good at that.\nOn the bright side, I don't have to engage politically with feminism in order to be a\nfeminist, or volunteer for feminist causes, or do feminist work. And it helps to understand\nthat I don't have to be \"a good feminist\" for my mother to be proud of me. (My dad's\nanother matter.)\n* * *\nDuring one of our recent conversations, I confirmed again with my mother that I had\npermission to write about her experience. Then I asked her if she's out of the closet as a\nrape survivor.\n\"I don't know,\" she said thoughtfully. \"I guess so. I don't really think about it. I'm happy\nwith my life now.\" She paused and drank her tea for a moment. \"I don't think of myself as\na rape survivor anymore,\" she added. \"By 1980, ten years after the attack, I really thought\nI was emerging from the cave. And I was, but I was still metaphorically covered in dirt\nand cobwebs, with grit in my mouth. In the first few years I was with your dad -- the\nearly 1980s -- I had residual fears. I had become frightened by subways, elevators, and\nsurprise noises, and he helped me work my way through those very effectively. By 25\nyears, it was simply no longer a part of my current self. I'd say I am wiser and stronger\nfor it, but I think an experience so shocking is a lousy way to build character. And a\nwaste of time! I lost too many years. I hope that things like victim advocacy saves\npeople.\"\nI'm glad that my mother feels good about life today, and I myself don't have the urge to\ntrack those guys down and rend them limb from limb. (Much.) Yet I wonder if the men\nwho attacked her ever think about what they did. I wonder if the ex-boyfriend ever\nunderstood how thoroughly he brutalized someone he claimed to love, or how male\nprivilege played a role in his actions. These days, I write a lot about masculinity, and I try\nto understand men's perspective on gender issues. Writing about men and gender is tricky\nterritory, though. What if I end up shoring up the entitlement that led that those assholes\nto attack my mom?\nMom told me that she Googled her rapist ex-boyfriend. He has three daughters. She\nwonders whether he ever thinks about it, too.\nNaturally, I also think a lot about feminism, and how we can make it both effective and\nwelcoming. What does it mean when people call it a movement that \"eats its young\"?\nWhat does it mean that feminism has become so tied up in identity? What does it mean\nwhen a rape survivor who had a career and raised a feminist daughter won't call herself a\nfeminist? What does it mean that taking on the \"feminist\" label means taking on a host of\nother associations -- associations that even women like my mother are unwilling to\naccept?\n* * *\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/05/25/my-moms-rape-story-and-a-confusedrelationship-with-feminism/\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nSection 3 Study Guide\nHaving established the building blocks of Section 1, and the extra perspectives of Section\n2, this section was intended to pull together some seriously multi-layered syntheses.\n* * *\n1.

She created and\ncurated the original Sex+++ sex-positive documentary film series at Chicago's historic\nfeminist site, Jane Addams Hull-House Museum. She has also volunteered as an\narchivist, curator and fundraiser for that venerable S&M institution, the Leather Archives\n& Museum. In 2010, Clarisse returned from working on HIV mitigation in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. Her writing has appeared across the Internet in many many places. She blogs\nabout feminist sexuality with a focus on S&M at clarissethorn.com, and tweets\n@clarissethorn.\nHandy links for connecting with Clarisse:\nBlog: http://clarissethorn.com/blog\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/ClarisseThorn\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/clarisse.thorn\nFind other Smashwords books by Clarisse:\nhttps://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/clarissethorn\n* * *\nAlso check out Clarisse's awesome book\nConfessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser!\n* * *\nThere's a huge subculture of men who trade tips, tricks, and tactics for seducing women.\nClarisse Thorn, a feminist S&M writer and activist, spent years researching these guys.\nShe observed their discussions, watched them in action, and learned their strategies. By\nthe end, she'd given a lecture at a seduction convention. This is her story -- and her\ntheories about feminism and seduction to boot.\nhttps://www.smashwords.com/books/view/144451\nIn paperback: https://www.createspace.com/3830583\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nClarisse's Lectures, Workshops and Events\nThank you so much for reading my work. Now for the hustle!\nI'm not just a writer -- I also give lectures and workshops, and organize events. Here's a\nshort list of some of the lectures, workshops and events I offer. I'm available by email at\nclarisse.thorn@gmail.com, if you'd like to bring me in.\n* * *\n* Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser. There's a whole subculture out there devoted\nto teaching men how to seduce women. Over the last few years, these underground\n\"pickup artists\" have slowly surfaced into the popular consciousness, with the help of\nbestselling books like Neil Strauss's The Game and hit reality shows like VH1's The\nPick-Up Artist. I spent two years doing on-and-off research into these Casanovas. In this\nlecture I discuss my experiences talking to pickup artists, learning their techniques,\nunderstanding their community frameworks and norms, and eventually giving them tips\non how to seduce women... all of which culminated in my book, Confessions of a Pickup\nArtist Chaser: Long Interviews With Hideous Men. This presentation was originally\ncreated for a lunchtime talk at the Center for Gender Studies at the University of Chicago,\nand I can deliver it in 90 minutes or less.\n* Leadership in the Bedroom: A Sexual Communication Workshop. Down-to-earth\ntips and ideas on how to communicate clearly about sex. This workshop was originally\nrequested by the University of Illinois at Chicago, but I've given versions of it at other\nvenues as well. It was one of the first workshops I ever designed, and I'm currently\nworking on streamlining it and making it more interactive. I can do it in an hour, but it's\nreally better with two hours.\n* BDSM Overview. Imagery deriving from bondage, discipline, dominance, submission,\nand sadomasochism (BDSM) is becoming commonplace -- and we all know (or think we\nknow) what a dominatrix is -- but most people don't have much idea of what BDSM\nactually involves. Although it is increasingly accepted as an alternative sexual\norientation, BDSM remains surrounded by stigma, scandal and occasional legal action.\nThis presentation covers the basics of BDSM (however, it's not a how-to lecture -- you\naren't going to learn how to use a whip, though you'll learn where to go to find out!). I\nprefer to poll the audience to see what they want to cover on top of that -- BDSM history?\ncultural landmarks? BDSM & feminism? legal issues? I've got it all! I have given this\nlecture more than any other. It can be squished into an hour, but I prefer two hours.\n* Sex-Positivity for Everyone! Including the Mens! What is masculinity or male\nadvocacy as a movement, and how is it in dialogue with contemporary feminism? Can it\nbe incorporated into feminism, or can the values of the sex-positive feminist community\nspeak to its concerns? What does positive, productive talk about masculinity sound like? I\ntalk about all this in a short lecturette and then facilitate small discussions on kinky male\nsexuality, men in the pickup artist community, and men who buy sex. This workshop was\noriginally requested by the University of Chicago, and based on feedback from that\nexperience and others, I have been adapting it. It should take about 90 minutes.\n* The Sex+++ Film Series at Jane Addams Hull-House Museum and related film\nscreenings. I have now overseen many many screenings of sex-positive documentaries,\nand facilitated followup discussions afterwards. In the past I have done this primarily to\naccomplish my own activist educational goals or to raise funds for deserving institutions,\nbut I'd be happy to run a screening or two upon request. Please note, however, that I don't\nown the rights to all the films I've screened, and so if you want me to run a screening for\nyou, you may need to budget extra in order to cover the rights. I started the Sex+++ Film\nSeries at Chicago's Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, and as I write this in 2012, the\nfilm series is in its fourth year. You can look at the film series calendar here:\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/03/17/the-sex-positive-documentary-film-list-2011-\n2012/\nI would certainly be willing to design a new workshop or lecture upon request -- in fact,\ntwo of the above events were created at the request of the institutions that invited me.\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nFootnotes\nAll these links were last checked in early 2012.\n* * *\nSection 1: The Basics\n* * *\nS&M: Love Bites: An S&M Coming-Out Story\n1.

One way I\ndo that is by avoiding jargon and by using terms that I think most people will recognize. I\noften write \"S&M\" instead of \"BDSM,\" for example; and when I'm using technical S&M\nlanguage like \"top\" or \"bottom\" or \"scene,\" I try to define the words as I go along. But\nsometimes I slip into jargon by accident. Also, plenty of S&M terms are super useful, and\ngiving a quick overview of S&M language can go a long way towards describing S&M\nculture. Hence, this glossary. Many of the terms in the Glossary aren't terms that I used\nin this book, but you might find it useful or interesting anyway. (I also included a few\nterms that come from other subcultures, like polyamory or queer studies or feminism,\nbecause why not.)\n* * *\naftercare (BDSM): A cool-down period after an S&M encounter, which often involves\nreassurance and a discussion of how things went. Aftercare is discussed a lot in this book,\nespecially in \"Aftercare or Brainwashing?\" (part 3).\nblaming the victim (feminism): The faulty assumption that an assault survivor caused or\ncontributed to the assault.\nbottom (BDSM): A blanket term for a masochist and/or submissive. Not everyone who is\na masochist is submissive, and vice versa.\ncisgendered (queer studies): A term that means \"not transgendered.\" For example,\nClarisse is a cis woman or a cisgendered woman. Here's an excellent essay by the trans\nactivist Asher Bauer describing why the word \"cisgendered\" is important:\nhttp://carnalnation.com/content/49458/1067/word-day-cis\ncoming out (queer studies): Openly acknowledging one's sexual identity to oneself, one's\nparents, one's friends, and other parts of one's community.\ndominant (BDSM): A person who enjoys being in charge during an S&M encounter.\ndungeon (BDSM): Dungeons can often be split into two types: those owned and staffed\nby professionals, and those owned by people who are drawn to S&M for non-monetary\nreasons. There is occasionally overlap between the two groups, but often there's less\noverlap than one might think. Professional BDSM is frequently banned at nonprofessional\ndungeons, and non-professional dungeons are frequently non-profit\norganizations. Indeed, many non-professional dungeons could be described as\n\"community centers\" for BDSMers. They're basically centralized nodes for BDSM\nsupport, and they may host lectures, workshops, discussion groups, public parties, or\nother meetups.\nenthusiastic consent (feminism): A standard for ethical sex whereby one is expected not\njust to have a consenting partner, but an enthusiastic and excited partner.\ngender policing (feminism): Gender roles are defined by culture, and when a person\nsteps outside their gender role, that person will often be policed or attacked by other\nmembers of the culture. For example, a USA man with long hair risks being mocked or\nbeaten up.\nhard limit (BDSM): A strong, negative BDSM preference that is discussed ahead of\ntime. For example, a person who absolutely does not want to have anal sex would\ndescribe anal sex as a hard limit. See also: soft limit.\nheteronormative (queer studies): A term used to describe the cultural expectations of\n\"normal\" heterosexual relationships. For example, the expectation that men are the ones\nto pursue women during romantic interactions is heteronormative.\nkink (BDSM): A specific preference. For example, if Clarisse enjoys being whipped,\nthen she has a kink for it. She could also say something like, \"I kink on being whipped.\"\nkinky (BDSM and others): A lot of BDSMers use \"kinky\" to mean \"into BDSM.\"\nHowever, there are some people who use the term more broadly and include practices\nthat aren't usually considered BDSM, such as polyamory or swing.\nlandmine (BDSM): An extremely sensitive psychological spot, sometimes hit\naccidentally during BDSM play. This is discussed further within this book, in \"What\nHappens After An S&M Encounter 'Gone Wrong'\" (part 3).\nmasochist (BDSM): A person who enjoys receiving pain.\nNew Relationship Energy (polyamory): The obsessive, irrational joy one feels after\nstarting a relationship with a new and awesome partner. Here's an article about it:\nhttp://aphroweb.net/articles/nre.htm\nout [of the closet] (queer studies): An adjective to describe a person who is open with\npeople outside her sexual subculture about her sexual identity.\nplay (BDSM): A verb for having an S&M encounter. For example, if Clarisse was\nwhipped by a gentleman, she might say that she \"played with him.\" Clarisse once saw a\ndisplay at the Leather Archives & Museum claiming that in Old Guard Leather Culture\n(i.e, gay men's S&M culture starting around the 1950s), the word was more often \"work\"\nthan \"play\" -- apparently, even S&M toys were usually called \"tools.\"\nplay party (BDSM): A party where S&M can happen openly. Some play parties ban\nsexual intercourse, while others don't.\npolyamory: A community to support people who want to have multiple lovers and be\nhonest with everyone involved. Polyamory usually focuses more on an emotional\nrelationship than swing, but not always. The writer Franklin Veaux has a good Polyamory\n101: http://www.xeromag.com/fvpoly.html And the blog Polyamory In The News has a\ngood post on the various distinctions between polyamory and swing:\nhttp://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2009/12/polys-vs-swingers-as-viewed-from-\n2010.html\nprimary relationship (polyamory): A relationship with more commitment and\nexpectations than other relationships. For example, a primary relationship might be one\nwhere the participants live together and/or are married. Polyamorists sometimes disagree\nabout whether relationship hierarchies are desirable.\nrape culture (feminism): A culture in which rape is prevalent and is maintained through\nfundamental attitudes and beliefs about gender, sexuality, and violence, including rape\nmyths.\nrape myths (feminism): Cultural ideas that make it harder to recognize, prosecute, and\nheal from rape. For example, many people believe that rape usually happens to young,\n\"hot\" women... but interviews with rapists show that they usually prioritize targets based\non how vulnerable they are, rather than how \"hot\" they are.\nsadist (BDSM): A person who enjoys inflicting pain.\nsafeword (BDSM): A word that any S&M participant can say at any time to stop the\naction. Safewords are extensively analyzed within this book, in the \"The Annotated\nSafeword\" (part 1).\nscene; The Scene (BDSM): The word scene is often used to indicate an S&M encounter.\nFor example, if Clarisse was whipped by some dude, she \"had a scene\" with him (or\nsome would say that she scened with him). The Scene is also sometimes used to indicate\nthe public S&M community -- the dungeons, workshops, lectures, discussion groups, and\nmeetups that create an open network of BDSMers in many areas.\nsecondary relationship (polyamory): A relationship with less commitment and fewer\nexpectations than other relationships. Polyamorists sometimes disagree about whether\nrelationship hierarchies are desirable.\nsoft limit (BDSM): A weak, negative BDSM preference that is discussed ahead of time.\nFor example, a person may strongly dislike anal sex, but be willing to have anal sex in\ncertain contexts, like when he's really turned on; in that case, anal sex would be a soft\nlimit. See also: hard limit.\nsquick (BDSM): A feeling of not wanting to participate in an act, without judging others\nfor doing it. For example, if a BDSMer feels sick at the sight of blood yet doesn't want to\nexpress disgust towards blood fetishists, then she might describe herself as squicked by\nblood. The BDSM subculture generally places a high value on recognizing that one can\nbe squicked by an act, without judging it.\nsubmissive (BDSM): A person who enjoys receiving orders or otherwise accepting an\nexperience defined by a partner.\nswing: A community to support people who want to have sex with multiple people and\nbe honest with everyone involved. Unlike polyamorists, swingers usually don't\nemphasize developing emotional connections in secondary relationships, but this isn't\nalways true. Clarisse is less familiar with swing than polyamory, but some swingers\nemailed her this Swing 101: http://www.swingersboard.com/forums/faq.php?\nfaq=swinger_faq And the blog Polyamory In The News has a good post on the various\ndistinctions between polyamory and swing: http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2009/12/\npolys-vs-swingers-as-viewed-from-2010.html\nswitch (BDSM): A person who feels comfortable in either the top or the bottom role.\ntop (BDSM): A blanket term for a sadistic and/or dominant partner. Not everyone who is\nsadistic is dominant, and vice versa.\nvanilla (BDSM): A term to describe people who aren't into BDSM, or sexual acts that\naren't perceived as BDSM. Some folks describe so-called \"slightly BDSM\" people or acts\nas french vanilla. Sometimes, non-BDSM people are offended by being described as\nvanilla, which Clarisse thinks is silly, but she often avoids the term anyway and says \"not\ninto S&M\" instead.\nze (queer studies): A gender-neutral pronoun, also written as \"xie.\" The possessive\nversion is \"zir\" or \"xir\" or, sometimes, \"hir.\"\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\nend\n"
