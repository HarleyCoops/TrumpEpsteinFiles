    "full_text": "THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION \nJuly 11, 2011 \nTo whom it may concern: \nFor the past three years, I have enjoyed a daily working relationship with Michael \nBocci°, having trusted him with many of my personal and business endeavors, in his \ncapacity of Managing Director of Business Development and Special Counsel. \nMichael was a person that I would call into my office and could always count on for a \nsmart point of view. Michael is as comfortable in a boardroom negotiating critical \nbusiness points as he is drafting a complex legal document. He naturally assumed a \nleadership role in any task that I assigned to him. He has prospered under my mentorship \nand I relied on him as an asset to every area of my business. \nI highly recommend Michael for employment or consideration as a partner in any \nbusiness venture. He will make any company or individual that may be lucky enough to \nwork alongside him more effective, efficient and profitable. \nincerely \nDonald Trump \n725 FIFTH AVENUE • NEW YORK, NY 10022 • \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029304 \n"
