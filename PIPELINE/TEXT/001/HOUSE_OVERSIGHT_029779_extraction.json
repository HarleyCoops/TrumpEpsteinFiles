Israel's \nrecent battle with the armed Hamas \nmovement in the Gaza Strip left many  \npredicting a wider fight in the future, as \ndivisions deepened within the Palestinian \nand Israeli electorates over whether talks \nor war would resolve the conflict. \n\"To make it a substantive trip that is \nmore than a positive photo-op would \nrequire setting up a specific framework \nfor an agreement and setting a tight \ndeadline to achieve it,\" said Jeremy Ben-\nAmi, the executive director of J Street, a \nnonprofit group that advocates the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029780 \ncreation of a Palestinian state alongside \nIsrael. \nWhite House officials would not provide \na date for Obama's trip, which he will \nsqueeze into the tight schedule he is \nbuilding around a busy domestic agenda \nthat includes immigration, guns and the \neconomy. \nBut Israeli media reported that Obama is \nscheduled to arrive March 20 as part of a \ntrip that will include a stop in Jordan, \nwhere the civil war in next-door Syria \nand its growing refugee crisis is \npresenting a major challenge to King \nAbdullah II, a U.S. ally. \nObama began his first term by making a \nstrong push for peace talks between Israel \nand the Palestinians, believing the \nconflict fueled radicalism in the region in \ngeneral and toward the United States in \nparticular, given its historical support for \nthe Jewish state. \nIn contrast to predecessor George W. \nBush, Obama wanted to demonstrate to \nArab governments that the United States \nwould make demands of Israel in pursuit \nof a regional peace agreement. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu made little secret of his \npreference for Republican Mitt Romney  \nin last year's U.S. presidential campaign. \nNetanyahu and Obama have at times \ndisagreed bitterly over issues relating to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029781 \nthe Palestinians, including Israel's \ncontinued settlement construction in the \nWest Bank and East Jerusalem. \nIsrael's military occupied those \nterritories, along with Gaza, in the 1967 \nArab-Israeli war. Palestinians view them \nas the key territorial elements of their \nfuture state. \nIn a June 2009 address in Cairo, a speech \nthat asked for a \"new beginning\" with the \nIslamic world, Obama said: \"The United \nStates does not accept the legitimacy of \ncontinued Israeli settlements.\" He also \ndid not stop in Israel on that trip, instead \nvisiting Saudi Arabia, Egypt and \nGermany, where he emphasized the  \nhorror of the Holocaust and the moral \nimperative of defending Israel. Romney, \namong others, made the omission a \ncampaign issue. \nBut on regional security issues, Obama \nand Netanyahu have deepened \ncooperation amid rising U.S. military aid \nto Israel. Obama has agreed with \nNetanyahu that Iran must not be allowed \nto use its uranium-enrichment program to \ndevelop a nuclear weapon, an issue that \nthe two will discuss during Obama's \nvisit. \nNetanyahu's Likud party emerged from \nelections last month as the largest bloc in \nIsrael's parliament, meaning that he will \nserve another term as prime minister. But \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029782 \na surprisingly strong showing by a new \ncentrist party is likely to put more \npressure on him to pursue talks. \n\"It was a mistake for Obama not to go in \nthe first term at a time when it could have \naffected Israeli public opinion of him, \nand now, it has hardened against him to a \npoint that I don't believe it can,\" said \nElliott Abrams, a senior fellow at the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations who served \nas a senior Middle East adviser to Bush. \nObama's visit will coincide with growing \nconcern in the region that the two-state \nsolution favored by him is in peril, as \nIsraeli settlement construction continues \nand as the Islamist Hamas gains clout \nwithin the once-secular Palestinian \nnationalist movement. Hamas emerged  \nstronger politically from the recent clash \nwith Israel and continues to reject the \nJewish state's right to exist. \nHamas and its secular rival Fatah are due \nto meet Saturday as part of a \nreconciliation process. If an agreement is \nreached and Hamas joins the Palestinian \nAuthority, Obama will be faced with an \nawkward decision on whether to meet \nwith a government that includes members \nof a U.S.-\ndesignated terrorist movement. \nAs he begins again in the region, Obama \nwill be advised by new Secretary of State \nJohn F. Kerry. He has also named former \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029783 \nsenator Chuck Hagel as defense \nsecretary, a nomination still in question \nafter an unsteady performance by the \ncandidate before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee last week that \nfocused in part on his past criticism of \nIsrael. \n\"This trip is a signal that the president \nhas an interest, not just in the peace issue, \nbut also in the broader concerns that \nIsrael is facing,\" said Dennis Ross, a \nsenior Middle East adviser to Obama \nduring his first term who is at the \nWashington Institute for Near East  \nPolicy. \"In some ways, it will be the \npresident traveling to Israel to ask for a \nnew beginning.\" \nArticle 2. \nForeign Policy \nSaeb Erekat - The Peace  \nProcessor  \nAn interview by Aaron David Miller \nFebruary 5, 2013 -- Other than Mahmoud \nAbbas, Saeb Erekat could be the most \nrecognizable Palestinian on the planet. \nThe chief Palestinian negotiator is \ncertainly among the most passionate in \npromoting the cause. And nobody on the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029784 \nPalestinian side knows the substance of \nthe issues or the negotiating history \nbetter. \nI first met Erekat in the late 1980s, while \nworking on the Palestinian issue for then \nSecretary of State George Shultz. Back \nthen, the U.S.-educated diplomat was \nalready showing the brashness and \noutspokenness that would make him one \nof the most memorable -- if exasperating \n-- of the Palestinians with whom we \ndealt. \nHe annoyed then Secretary of State \nJames Baker by wearing his kaffiyeh \naround his shoulders at the opening of the \nMadrid Peace Conference in October \n1991. And over the years, he continued to \nannoy the Israelis too with his fiery \nperformances on CNN -- though to this \nday, key Israeli negotiators, such as Isaac \nMolho, continue to praise his pragmatism \nat the bargaining table. \nIt was Erekat's academic bent, analytical \nchops, and capacity to write in English \nthat would make him so indispensable to \nthe only Palestinian who really counted \nin those days -- Yasir Arafat. Erekat was \na unique figure -- neither a fighter (no \nnom de guerre for him), nor a PLO \ninsider, nor an organization man from \nTunis. Rather, he was a West Banker \nfrom Jericho, and he succeeded in \nmaintaining his relevance in a Palestinian \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029785 \npolitical scene dominated not by fellow \nacademics, but by hard men defined by \nstruggle and intrigue. During the heady \ndays of the peace process, he became a \nkey point of contact for the Americans, \nthe Israelis, the Arabs, and much of the \nrest of the international community. \nI came to know Erekat not only as a \nnegotiator, but as a person. He sent his \nkids to Seeds of Peace, a conflict \nresolution and coexistence organization \nthat I ran briefly after leaving the State \nDepartment, and my daughter befriended \nhis and stayed with the Erekats in \nJericho. Saeb and I have yelled at each \nother, defended our respective positions, \nlaughed, and mourned opportunities that \nwere never adequately explored. But \nthrough it all, what he said about himself \nwas true: He wasn't as pro-Palestinian or \npro-Israeli as much as he was pro-peace. \nThat peace has proven elusive to this day. \nBut with all our differences -- and there \nare many -- I believe Erekat believes in \nits possibility. Who else would list as an \n\"objective\" on his resume: \"Solve the \nPalestinian-Israeli conflict based on a two \nstate negotiated solution through \ndiplomatic offices\"? \nIf, or perhaps when, another effort to \nnegotiate a deal is made, one thing is \nclear -- Erekat will be in the middle of it. \nLast week, he agreed to answer my \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029786 \nquestions on the past and future of the \nIsraeli-Palestinian problem. \nFP: What were your best and worst \nmoments in the Israeli-Palestinian \nnegotiations, and what was the greatest \nmissed opportunity? \nSaeb Erekat: Though I was not the chief \nnegotiator at that moment, the connection \nbetween [then Prime Minister Yitzhak] \nRabin and President Arafat made \neveryone around them, including myself, \nfeel that peace was possible. There was \nsignificant progress in all tracks until \nRabin's assassination by an Israeli \nterrorist -- after he was killed, no Israeli \nleader had the vision to understand that \nthe window of opportunity for a two-state \nsolution would close as fast as they \ncontinued their colonization policies. \nThe missed opportunity has definitely \nbeen Israel throwing away the Arab \nPeace Initiative, which offers \nnormalization of relations of 57 countries \nwith Israel in exchange for Israeli \nwithdrawal to the 1967 border. They \nthrew it away by bombing Gaza, by \nintensifying collective punishments, and \nby increasing settlement construction all \nover the occupied West Bank, \nparticularly in and around Occupied East \nJerusalem. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029787 \nFP: 2013 is the 20th anniversary of the \nOslo negotiations. What was Oslo's \ngreatest success, and its greatest failure? \nSE: The fact that, two decades after Oslo, \nwe are still a nation under occupation \nshows that Israeli governments did derail \nit. The interim accords were not supposed \nto last for 20 years but only five. After \nthat, we were going to enjoy freedom and \nsovereignty. \nBut Israel increased its settlement \nexpansion. In fact, within 20 years, the \nnumber of settlers almost tripled. The \ninstitution-building efforts led by the \nPalestinian government have been \ncompletely undermined by the lack of \nfreedom. This situation cannot continue. \nOslo succeeded in bringing back 250,000 \nPalestinians from the diaspora and \nbuilding the capacity for our state. The \ninternational community failed though, \nby granting Israel an unprecedented \nculture of impunity that allowed them to \nuse negotiations as a means to continue \nrather than stop colonization. \nFP: What is the most important \nthing Israelis don't understand about \nPalestinians? \nSE: That we are not going anywhere. As \nsimple as that. We are not going to \ndisappear just because their government \nbuilds an annexation wall around us. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029788 \nThey should close their eyes and imagine \ntheir state within 10 years time. What do \nthey see? If they continue their policies, \nthey are going to officially adopt the form \nof an apartheid regime, which I think is \nnot what many Israelis want. \nFP: What is the most important thing \nPalestinians have learned about Israelis? \nSE: That Israelis will not take back the \nships that brought them here to leave \nsomewhere else. We got to understand \nthat we have to live side by side. The \nrules of engagement, though, cannot be \nthose of apartheid, but those of freedom. \nFP: What do you expect from the next \nIsraeli government on the peace process? \nSE: I don't think there is room for \noptimism, but our position hasn't \nchanged. We don't see any other solution \nthan a two-state solution. Any Israeli \ngovernment that recognizes this fact and \nrespects what previous governments have \nagreed upon should become a partner for \npeace. \nFP: Is Hamas-Fatah unity possible, and \nwhat would the impact be on the future of \nIsraeli-Palestinian negotiations? \nSE: We expect to have progress in the \nnear future, with Hamas allowing the \nCentral Elections Commission to register \nnew voters in Gaza. I believe there is \npolitical agreement -- in fact, there is a \nsigned agreement. We expect to have \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029789 \nelections as soon as possible, which is the \nright way to solve our differences: Let \nour people decide, those in Palestine as \nwell as our people in the Diaspora. \nHaving said so, Hamas has recognized \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization as \nthe sole and legitimate representative of \nthe Palestinian people, including its \nmandate to negotiate a final status \nagreement with Israel. Once that is \nachieved, we expect to hold a national \nreferendum. \nFP: How would you describe Egypt's \nrole in the peace process now? What do \nyou expect from President Barack \nObama's administration with regards to \nthe peace process? \nSE: Egypt has played a central role, and \ncontinues to do so. We trust that Egypt, \nunder President Mohamed Morsy's \nleadership, will continue to play a strong \nrole because Palestine and Egypt have a \ncommon interest in achieving peace. \nPresident Obama had stated that he has a \npersonal commitment to bring peace to \nthe Middle East. We, the Egyptians, and \nthe rest of the Arab world tell him that we \nare ready for peace. We have the Arab \nPeace Initiative. This goes in line with \nthe stated U.S. national interest. \nWashington's failure to explicitly say that \nIsrael is to blame for choosing \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029790 \nsettlements over peace has contributed to \nIsrael's culture of impunity. \nFP: Can America be an effective broker \nin negotiations? \nSE: If the U.S. decides to be an honest \nbroker, it could not only be effective but \nin fact could bring real peace to the \nregion, a just and lasting one. The U.S. \nhas a moral obligation toward the \nPalestinian people, who have been under \noccupation and living in exile for \ndecades. \nFP: Is a two state solution still possible? \nSE: Yes, but only if there is a political \nwill. So far, Israel's will is about \ncolonization, and the international \ncommunity has failed to put an end to \ndecades of double standards by treating \nIsrael as a state above the law. We don't \nsee any other solution than a two-state \nsolution, though Israel is taking us to a \none-state reality. \nAaron David Miller is a distinguished \nscholar at the Woodrow Wilson \nInternational Center for Scholars. \nArticle 3. \nThe Daily Beast \nThe Mixed Legacy Of \nShimon Peres  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029791 \nDaniel Gavron \nFeb 4, 2013 -- Now that he has finished \nhis consultations with the country's \npolitical parties and charged Benjamin \nNetanyahu with forming a new coalition, \nIsrael's respected President, Shimon \nPeres, is once again very much in the \nnews. In his speech inviting Netanyahu to \nform the next government, the President \nspoke forcefully about peace and even \nseemed to influence Bibi to mention \npeace, a word he never used in his \nelection campaign. Peres has rightly \nearned respect for this from many \nquarters, but now, as the coalition is \nbeing formed, it might be a good time to \nexamine one aspect of Israel's political \nculture: the lack of respect for the task of \na parliamentary opposition. Peres is at \nleast partly to blame for this, as he almost \nalways preferred to join various \nadministrations—even as a junior \npartner—rather than lead the opposition, \nofen citing \"our grave situation\" and \n\"national responsibility.\" Now is surely \na better time to criticize Peres than in \nJune, when the world (maybe even \nincluding President Barack Obama) will \nbe coming here to celebrate his 90th \nbirthday. Then, surely, everyone will be \npaying deserved tribute to the wisdom of \nthis elder statesman and prophet of peace, \nand it would be a shame to spoil the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029792 \nparty. So let's clear the air right now, \nwell before the festivities. Before we get \nto the matter of coalition politics, which \nis very much on our minds right now as \nNetanyahu struggles to put together a \ngovernment, let us consider the other \nnegative part of the Peres legacy: his stint \nas Defense Minister under Prime Minister \nYitzhak Rabin from 1974 to 1977. Today \nPeres is widely respected as the architect \nof the Oslo Accord of 1993, achieved \nwhile he was Foreign Minister. It was the \nfirst political move toward a settlement \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians, and \nPeres deserves huge credit for securing \nthe agreement. However, two decades \nearlier, as Defense Minister, he supported \nthe Jewish settlement project in the \nnewly-conquered Palestinian territories, \nboth overtly and covertly. Not for \nnothing did Rabin label Peres in his \nmemoirs as \"an indefatigable intriguer.\" \nIn 1975, while Rabin was doing his \nutmost to prevent the settlement of Elon \nMoreh, near Nablus, Peres continuously \nsabotaged his efforts. After no less than \neight settlement attempts, which were \nruled illegal by Israel's Supreme Court, a \n\"compromise\" was reached, and Elon \nMoreh was established five kilometers to \nthe east of the original site. Moreover, \nduring the furor over Elon Moreh, \nDefense Minister Peres quietly facilitated \nthe creation of Ofra, near Ramallah. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029793 \nThese two settlements, which have \nbecome flagships of the settlement \nmovement, were the start of Jewish \ncolonization in Samaria, the northern part \nof the West Bank. The previous year, as \na young reporter, I interviewed Peres, \nafter he and his political ally Moshe \nDayan had refused \"on principle\" to join \nthe government of Golda Meir. \"If a \nsingle child can learn that politics is not \njust intrigues,\" Peres told me, \"I will be \nsatisfied that we have done our bit.\" Just \none week later, when he and Dayan had \nreversed their position for no discernable \nreason, and were seated snugly around \nthe cabinet table, I asked Peres what he \nhad to say to the \"single child.\" His aides \nsniggered, but Peres didn't bat an eyelid: \n\"Just what my mentor, David Ben-Gurion \n(Israel's first Prime Minister) told me: \nwhen the security of Israel is laid on one \nside of the scales, and everything else on \nthe other side, security tips the \nbalance.\" Peres subsequently used that \nself-same argument to join every \ngovernment that would have him. The \nlate Menachem Begin lost nine elections \nbefore finally becoming Israel's Prime \nMinister in 1977. He served as a \npugnacious and dedicated leader of the \nopposition. Peres almost never headed \nthe opposition, always preferring a \nministerial appointment, once even \ndesigning a grotesque system of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029794 \n\"rotation\" with Yitzhak Shamir, so that \nhe could be in the government. He \nproposed the ideal of \"national unity,\" \nand greatly devalued the democratic \nconcept of parliamentary opposition. \nFormer Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni \nruined her reputation when she refused to \njoin Netanyahu in his last government. \nWhile it is quite true that Livni was an \nineffective opposition leader, it is the \nvery fact of her refusal to join the \nadministration and \"influence it from \nwithin\" that has provoked most of the \ncriticism by Israeli political \ncommentators. Similar criticism is \ncurrently being leveled at Labor Party \nleader Shelly Yachimovich for stating \nclearly that she would not join \nNetanyahu's next government, but would \nserve as leader of the opposition. There \nare certainly many reasons to criticize \nYachimovich, but not her eminently \ndemocratic decision to lead the \nparliamentary opposition. Very few of \nour political commentators have ever \nexpressed respect or even understanding \nfor the concept of opposition. The most \npopular political idea in Israel today is \nnational unity—better still, a National \nUnity Government: \"We should all rally \nround the flag and support our \ngovernment in these critical times.\" This \nposition, widely espoused, echoes what \nPeres has said repeatedly over the years. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029795 \nSo, although the Peres vision of peace is \na positive legacy, he has also taught us \nless helpful lessons. The settlements are a \nsupremely negative inheritance, but I \nwould argue that the anti-democratic \nrejection of the concept of a \nparliamentary opposition is an even more \nharmful bequest handed down to us by \nPresident Shimon Peres. \nDaniel Gavron, who lives in Israel, is a \nformer journalist and the author of nine \nbooks, the most recent of which is Holy \nLand Mosaic, stories of cooperation and \ncoexistence between Israelis and \nPalestinians (Rowman & Littlefield, \n2008). \nArticle 4. \nNYT \nIndia vs. China vs. Egypt \nThomas L. Friedman  \nFebruary 5, 2013 -- New Delhi -- It's \nhard to escape a visit to India without \nsomeone asking you to compare it to \nChina. This visit was no exception, but I \nthink it's more revealing to widen the \naperture and compare India, China and \nEgypt. India has a weak central \ngovernment but a really strong civil \nsociety, bubbling with elections and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029796 \nassociations at every level. China has a \nmuscular central government but a weak \ncivil society, yet one that is clearly \nstraining to express itself more. Egypt, \nalas, has a weak government and a very \nweak civil society, one that was \nsuppressed for 50 years, denied real \nelections and, therefore, is easy prey to \nhave its revolution diverted by the one \ngroup that could organize, the Muslim \nBrotherhood, in the one free space, the \nmosque. But there is one thing all three \nhave in common: gigantic youth bulges \nunder the age of 30, increasingly \nconnected by technology but very \nunevenly educated. \nMy view: Of these three, the one that will \nthrive the most in the 21st century will be \nthe one that is most successful at \nconverting its youth bulge into a \n\"demographic dividend\" that keeps \npaying off every decade, as opposed to a \n\"demographic bomb\" that keeps going \noff every decade. That will be the society \nthat provides more of its youth with the \neducation, jobs and voice they seek to \nrealize their full potential. \nThis race is about \"who can enable and \ninspire more of its youth to help build \nbroad societal prosperity,\" argues Dov \nSeidman, the author of \"How\" and \nC.E.O. of LRN, which has an operating \ncenter in India. \"And that's all about \nleaders, parents and teachers creating \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029797 \nenvironments where young people can be \non a quest, not just for a job, but for a \ncareer — for a better life that doesn't just \nsurpass but far surpasses their parents.\" \nCountries that fail to do that will have a \nyouth bulge that is not only unemployed, \nbut unemployable, he argued. \"They will \nbe disconnected in a connected world, \ndespairing as they watch others build and \nrealize their potential and curiosity.\" \nIf your country has either a strong \ngovernment or a strong civil society, it \nhas the ability to rise to this challenge. If \nit has neither, it will have real problems, \nwhich is why Egypt is struggling. China \nleads in providing its youth bulge with \neducation, infrastructure and jobs, but \nlags in unleashing freedom and curiosity. \nIndia is the most intriguing case — if it \ncan get its governance and corruption \nunder control. The quest for upward \nmobility here, especially among women \nand girls, is palpable. I took part in the \ngraduation ceremony for The Energy and \nResources Institute last week. Of 12 \nawards for the top students, 11 went to \nwomen. \n\"India today has 560 million young \npeople under the age of 25 and 225 \nmillion between the ages of 10 and 19,\" \nexplained Shashi Tharoor, India's \nminister of state for human resource \ndevelopment. \"So for the next 40 years \nwe should have a youthful working-age \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029798 \npopulation\" at a time when China and the \nbroad industrialized world is aging. \nAccording to Tharoor, the average age in \nChina today is around 38, whereas in \nIndia it's around 28. In 20 years, that gap \nwill be much larger. So this could be a \nhuge demographic dividend — \"provided \nthat we can educate our youth — offering \nvocational training to some and \nuniversity to others to equip them to take \nadvantage of what the 21st-century global \neconomy offers,\" said Tharoor. \"If we get \nit right, India becomes the workhorse of \nthe world. If we get it wrong, there is \nnothing worse than unemployable, \nfrustrated\" youth. \nIndeed, some of India's disaffected youth \nare turning to Maoism in rural areas. \"We \nhave Maoists among our tribal \npopulations, who have not benefited from \nthe opportunities of modern India,\" \nTharoor said. There have been violent \nMaoist incidents in 165 of India's 625 \ndistricts in recent years, as Maoists tap \ninto all those left out of the \"Indian \ndream.\" So there is now a huge push here \nto lure poor kids into school. India runs \nthe world's biggest midday lunch \nprogram, serving 250 million free school \nlunches each day. It's also doubled its \nnumber of Indian Institutes of \nTechnology, from eight to 16, and is \nplanning 14 new universities for \ninnovation and research. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029799 \nBut this will all be for naught without \nbetter governance, argues Gurcharan Das, \nthe former C.E.O. of Procter & Gamble \nIndia, whose latest book is \"India Grows \nat Night: A Liberal Case for a Strong \nState.\" \"The aspirational India has no one \nto vote for, because no one is talking the \nlanguage of public goods. Why should it \ntake us 15 years to get justice in the \ncourts or 12 years to build a road? The \ngap between [youth] aspirations and \ngovernment performance is huge. My \nthesis is that India has risen despite the \nstate. It is a story of public failure and \nprivate success.\" \nThat is what Das means by India grows at \nnight, when government sleeps. \"But \nIndia must learn to grow during the day,\" \nhe said. \"If India fixes its governance \nbefore China fixes its politics that is who \nwill win. ... You need a strong state and a \nstrong society, so the society can hold the \nstate accountable. India will only get a \nstrong state when the best of society join \nthe government, and China will only get \na strong society when the best Mandarins \ngo into the private sector.\" \nArticle 5. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029800 \nForeign Policy \nDon't be too sure there  \nwon't be another U.S.  \nwar in the Middle East \nRichard L. Russell \nFebruary 5, 2013 -- Shortly before he left \noffice in Feb. 2011, Defense Secretary \nRobert Gates told West Point cadets that \n\"in my opinion, any future defense \nsecretary who advised the president to \nagain send a big American land army into \nAsia or into the Middle East or Africa \nshould 'have his head examined,' as \nGeneral MacArthur so delicately put it.\" \nThe remark no doubt reflected Sec. \nGates's fatigue and frustration from the \nenormous intellectual and emotional \nburdens associated with overseeing the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nOne suspects, however, that in a more \nreflective moment, Gates would have \nacknowledged that \"never say never\" is a \nwise rule of thumb in planning for \nmilitary contingencies, especially in the \nregion that makes up Central Command's \narea-of-responsibility. Few, for example, \npredicted the 1979 Soviet invasion of \nAfghanistan. Gates himself -- who was a \nsenior CIA official during the covert war \nsupporting the Afghan resistance -- surely \ndid not anticipate then that the United \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029801 \nStates would have to return to \nAfghanistan two decades later to oust a \nTaliban regime that was harboring \nterrorists. Before 1990, moreover, no one \npredicted that Iraq, having just ended a \nbitter eight-year war with Iran, would \nswing its battered forces south to invade \nKuwait. \nSo if it's conventional wisdom that the \nUnited States will not, or should not, \nintervene militarily in the Middle East or \nSouth Asia after it draws down forces in \nIraq and Afghanistan, it's also likely dead \nwrong. What is true, however, is that \npolitical and military trajectories in the \nMiddle East and South Asia are likely to \nincreasingly challenge U.S. contingency \naccess in the coming decade. The ability \nfor the United States to surge large-scale \nforces into the region, as it did in the \n1990 and 2003 wars against Iraq, will \ngrow increasingly circumscribed. The \nUnited States will have to adapt to this \nnew strategic landscape by developing \nmore nimble, highly-mobile, stealthy, and \nnetworked forces, and by abandoning the \ntraditional practice of slowly and steadily \nbuilding up conventional forces at \nregional logistic hubs prior to launching \nwar. \n* * * \nPerhaps the most significant factor that \nportends against further intervention in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029802 \nthe Middle East and South Asia is \nincreased political resistance -- and \noutright opposition -- from the countries \nin the region. That resistance is likely to \ncome from the new regimes emerging \nfrom the Arab uprisings, as well as a \nnumber of Gulf monarchies. \nIndeed, the political trends in the region \nare unlikely to conform to the rosy \npredictions of democratic peace theorists, \nwhose musings have implicitly informed \nthe security policies of both Republican \nand Democratic administrations for \ndecades. Old authoritarian regimes seem \nto be passing the way of the dodo bird, \nbut the new regimes taking shape are \nheavily influenced by militant Islamic \nideology that will make them less likely \nto engage in security or military \ncooperation with the United States. \nDemocracy optimists argue that these \nideological regimes, once entrenched in \npower, will have to moderate their zeal in \norder to govern. Pragmatism will \nultimately trump ideology. That line of \nreasoning, however, is based on the \nassumption that the policy decisions of \nsuch regimes can be explained by rational \nchoice economic theory. In other words, \nif they want to attract international capital \nand participate in the world economy, \nthey are going to have to break with their \nideological affinities. But that reasoning \nignores a hard fact of international \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029803 \npolitics: that time and again, political and \nideological prerogatives trump economic \nrationality. It made little economic sense, \nfor example, for Pakistan to pursue a \nnuclear weapons program in the 1970s, \njust as it makes little economic sense for \nIran to do so today. Clearly, both \nPakistan and Iran made major policy \ndecisions based on political-military \npriorities rather than economic \ncalculations. \nAs for the surviving monarchies in the \nMiddle East, they too will likely be less \naccommodating to American military \nforces than they have been in the past. To \nbe sure, much of the Arab support for \npast American military operations -- like \nboth Iraq wars -- was hidden from the \npublic eye. Arab states often loudly and \npublicly denounced \"unilateral \nAmerican\" military action in the region at \nthe same time as they supported it in \nbackroom dealings, quietly authorizing \nfacilities support and air, land, and sea \naccess. \nBut if Arab Gulf states were quietly \nsupportive in the past, their opposition to \nAmerican military force is likely to grow \nin the future. They read the aftermath of \nthe Arab uprisings much differently than \ndid American and European \npolicymakers. The Gulf monarchies were \nshocked that the United States \n\"abandoned\" Egyptian President Hosni \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029804 \nMubarak in his time of need in early \n2011. Their leaders expected the United \nStates to push for Mubarak and the \nEgyptian military to crack down on \npublic protests in Cairo. After all, \nAmerican policymakers during the Carter \nadministration had at least given this \npolicy option consideration during the \nIranian revolution in 1979. \nAlready, several Gulf states have begun \nto translate their displeasure into policy \nindependence from Washington. In 2011, \nfor example, a coalition of Gulf states led \nby Saudi Arabia intervened in Bahrain to \nquell domestic unrest in the island \ncountry. They did so under the banner of \nthe Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), \nwhich for years had been a feckless \nmilitary force. Largely unnoticed in \nWestern commentary was that the GCC, \nfor the first time in its history, mounted a \nrelatively effective military intervention. \nBahrain today is for all intents and \npurposes a province of Saudi Arabia, \neven if it is not polite to say so in \ndiplomatic circles. Since the Iranian \nrevolution, Bahrain -- like the United \nArab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar \n-- has pursued close ties with the United \nStates, in significant measure to \ncounterbalance Iran and Saudi Arabia. \nWith Washington at their back, they were \nable to stake out security policies that \nwere at least nominally independent from \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029805 \nSaudi Arabia. When Saudi Arabia wanted \nAmerican forces removed from the \nkingdom, for example, Qatar was eager \nto compensate by hosting a more robust \nAmerican command presence in the \nregion. \nThe Arab uprisings and subsequent GCC \nintervention in Bahrain have turned the \ntables, making Saudi security backing a \nnecessity for the smaller Gulf \nmonarchies. From their perspective, \nAmerican forces are clearly more capable \nthan Saudi forces, but given the \nalignment of their interests, Riyadh is a \nmore reliable security partner. Gulf \nleaders and military commanders in the \ncoming decade will be focused on how to \navoid following in Mubarak's footsteps. \nPart of minimizing that risk will involve \ndecreasing security dependency on the \nUnited States. Gulf leaders have to worry \nthat if push comes to shove, the \nAmericans will throw them under a bus \njust like they did to Mubarak. \n* * * \nIf the political dynamics in the Middle \nEast and South Asia do not favor further \nAmerican military intervention in the \nfuture, neither do the emerging military \ntrends. The proliferation of supersonic \ncruise missiles and mines in the region \nwill make for nasty forced entries into \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029806 \nnarrow maritime confines like the Suez \nCanal, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf \nBut the likely proliferation of nuclear \nweapons -- and ballistic missile delivery \nsystems -- will pose even more \nformidable challenges to conventional \nmilitary surges in the region. In the \nfuture, the United States will not be able \nto take for granted unchallenged surges \nof naval, air, and ground forces into \nregional theaters via logistics hubs. These \nhubs -- like the American naval presence \nin Bahrain -- are large, readily \nidentifiable, and will be increasingly \nvulnerable to future targeting by nuclear \nweaponry. \nIran's nuclear weapons, assuming it gets \nthem, will pose a direct threat to \nAmerican military surge capabilities. \nAlthough American policymakers and \nmilitary commanders might feel \nconfident that they could surge forces \ninto the Gulf despite Iranian nuclear \nthreats because of the American nuclear \ndeterrent, Gulf security partners might be \nmore nervous and less willing to \ncooperate. As a result, they might not \ngrant access to U.S. air, naval, and \nground forces out of fear of angering \nIran. \nAmerican observers who doubt that Gulf \nstates would make such calculations \nshould recall how Kuwait responded in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029807 \nthe lead-up to Iraq's invasion in 1990. \nWhen faced with a build-up of Iraqi \nforces along its border, Kuwait decided \nnot to mobilize its military out of fear \nthat the move would provoke Saddam \nHussein. The incentives for Gulf states to \nmake similar strategic calculations in the \nfuture will be greater when Iran has an \ninventory of nuclear weapons to match its \ngrowing ballistic missile capabilities. \nThe Gulf states, moreover, will likely \nreason that the U.S. capability to threaten \nor use force against a nuclear Iran will be \nsignificantly diminished. Even without \nnuclear weapons, Gulf states have seen, \nin their view, a long history of American \nreluctance to threaten or use force against \nIran. For example, the United States took \nno direct military action against Iran after \nit aided and abetted Hezbollah bombings \nagainst Americans in Lebanon in the \n1980s, after Iran supported the bombing \nof Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in \n1996, or even after Iran supported the \ndeadly campaign of improvised explosive \ndevices (IEDs) against U.S. troops in \nIraq. Gulf states will no doubt judge that \nif the United States was unable and \nunwilling to attack Tehran under these \ncircumstances, then it is certainly not \ngoing to attack Iran in the future, when it \nwill be able to retaliate with nuclear \nweapons. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029808 \nAmerican policymakers may counter that \nIran would never be foolish enough to \nthreaten or use nuclear weapons against \nthe United States, given its robust nuclear \ndeterrence posture. But the threat or use \nof nuclear weapons might not look so \nfoolish from Iran's perspective. One of \nthe great strategic lessons drawn from the \nlong history of conflict in the Middle East \nis this: Do not go to war without nuclear \nweapons, as Saddam Hussein did when \nhe invaded Kuwait. The corollary is: Do \nnot allow the United States to \nmethodically build-up forces in the Gulf \nprior to invading, as Saddam did both in \nthe run-up to the 1991 re-conquest of \nKuwait and in 2003, before the drive to \ntopple the regime in Baghdad. \nDrawing upon these lessons, Iran will \nlikely do everything in its power to deny \nthe United States the ability to surge \nconventional forces into the region -- and \nthat might include threatening to target \nU.S. forces with nuclear weapons. Iran \nmight accept the risk that preemptive use \nof nuclear weapons could bring on \nAmerican nuclear retaliation, because \nfailure to do so would mean certain \ndestruction for the regime. The United \nStates would be able to build-up \nconventional forces in the region and oust \nIran's leaders just as it did in Baghdad. \nThis line of strategic reasoning runs \ncounter to conventional wisdom in the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029809 \nWest, but we actually know little or \nnothing about what Iranian decision-\nmakers think about nuclear weapons or \ndeterrence theory. Since the Iranian \nrevolution in 1979, opportunities for the \nexchange of professional views between \nWestern and Iranian scholars, \npolicymakers, and military leaders on \nthese critically important issues have \nbeen extremely limited. Therefore, it's not \nunreasonable to assume that the Iranians, \nlike American policymakers in the early \nstages of developing their nuclear triad \ndoctrine, will think of nuclear weapons as \nmerely \"big artillery.\" Unfortunately, the \nUnited States and its security partners \nlack formal and informal exchanges with \nthe Iranians akin to the Cold War \ndiscussions and arms control negotiations \nbetween the Americans and Soviets, \nwhich allowed both parties to develop \nmutual understandings of the other's \nperception of nuclear weapons. These \nunderstandings were essential for crisis \nmanagement in the Cold War strategic \nrelationship after the Cuban missile \ncrisis. \nMeanwhile, the Gulf states, led by Saudi \nArabia, are likely to look for their own \nnuclear deterrents. Much like France \nwanted its own nuclear force de frappe \nduring the Cold War, the Gulf states will \nwant their own nuclear weapons to deter \nIran. Saudi Arabia and the smaller Gulf \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029810 \nstates will worry that the United States \nwould be deterred from coming to their \ndefense in future regional crises by Iran's \nnuclear weapons. \nSaudi Arabia and other Arab states are \nlikely to see nuclear weapons as a quick \nfix for all of their security woes. \nAlthough they have been on a shopping \nspree in the past decade, buying \nexpensive and sophisticated Western \nmilitary technology, they have had a \ntough time absorbing the new technology \nand fully utilizing and integrating \nweapons systems. To be sure, in a rough  \nnet assessment, Saudi Arabia and its \nallies in the Gulf have significantly \ngreater conventional capabilities than \nIran. But if Iran goes nuclear, they will \nwant to follow suit. \n* * * \nAmericans may be weary of conflict in \nthe Middle East and South Asia, but \nstrategic prudence demands that we \ncontemplate future military interventions \nin the Central Command theater. A scan \nof the horizon reveals that both political \nand military trends in the region pose \nformidable obstacles to conventional \nforce surges into the region. \nBut there is another wrinkle in this story \nthat U.S. policymakers must contend with \nas they plan for the future. As Gulf \nmonarchies seek to reduce their \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029811 \ndependence on American military power, \nthey will increasingly look to China for \nsecurity assurances. China does not have \na political agenda devoted to promoting \ndemocratization, and it maintains \npolitical and diplomatic ties with both \nArab states and Iran. China's military \nactivity in the region is modest but \nincreasing, as evidenced by its recent \npeacekeeping dispatches to the region \nand naval port visits in the Gulf Beijing \nis likely to send more naval forces to the \nGulf to increase its presence there and \nenhance its ability to protect the sea lanes \nwhich bring oil to China's thirsty \neconomy. China is keenly aware that the \nUnited States has naval supremacy in the \nGulf, but will be working to erode that \nstrategic edge in the future. \nFaced with these realities, there is a need \nfor new thinking and innovative \nconceptualizations of surges into \nCentcom's area of responsibility. Theater \ncampaign planners will have to think \nabout contingencies in which the United \nStates cannot slowly and methodically \nbuild up forces in the region and then \nkick off campaigns after most troops, \narms, and equipment are in place. Future \nU.S. force build-ups in the region will be \nfar too vulnerable to preemptive nuclear \nstrikes. As a result, planners will have to \ndevise campaign plans in which the \ninsertion of U.S. military forces begins \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029812 \nwith an immediate rolling and flowing \nstart. The United States will have to work \nfrom smaller troop footprints and be \nprepared to start fighting even as follow-\non-forces are on the way. Ideally, these \nforces would flow from multiple staging \npositions to reduce vulnerability to \nnuclear attack. The politics of the region, \nhowever, will work against securing a \nmultitude of staging areas from which to \ndeploy. \nThe region under the purview of \nCentcom has always been riddled with \npolitical violence that has posed \nformidable challenges to military \noperations. But in plotting a course over \nthe horizon, the political and military \nobstacles for American military surges \ninto the region are poised to grow even \nlarger. As a result, theater contingency \nplanners will have fewer good options for \nprojecting American military power into \nthe region -- and they'll have to do more \nwith the bad and the ugly. \nRichard L.

And since then \nthe United States, the European powers, \nRussia, and China, all sought to arrange \nanother round of negotiations, first in \nDecember and then in January. It now \nappears that Iran, which is about to enter \nits presidential election season, has \nfinally agreed to what will be the first \nround of negotiations with the P5+1 since \nthe last round in Moscow seven months \nago. On Tuesday, Tehran announced that \nit will join talks on February 26 in \nKazakhstan. \nThe negotiations will be a serious test for \nthe Obama administration and for John \nKerry, the new secretary of state. \nPrevious rounds have all faltered because \nneither side was willing to make \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029814 \nconcessions to the other, and so far there \nis little sign that the United States and the \nP5+1 have improved their offer to Iran \nvery much. As the talks were announced, \nthe Washington Post reported: \"The P5+1 \npowers have made only mild revisions to \na proposal that Iran flatly rejected last \nJune.\" Until now, the United States has \nbeen unwilling to acknowledge Iran's \nright to enrich uranium on its own soil \nand to suggest that some economic \nsanctions might be lifted as part of a deal, \nand Iran has refused to agree even to a \nlimited deal called \"stop, ship, and shut\" \n— involving the suspension of its \nenrichment to 20 percent purity, shipping \nits existing stockpiles of 20% uranium to \na third country for processing, and \nshutting down its underground facility at \nFordo, near Qom — without an agreement \nto lift sanctions. \nAfter the reelection of Barack Obama in \nNovember, there were great hopes that \nthe president would have greater political \nfreedom of offer concessions to Iran. Yet, \npublicly at least, the White House isn't \nsignaling that it is ready to make a more \ngenerous offer to Iran, and in fact Obama \nin January signed into law yet another \nround of draconian economic sanctions. \nPerhaps as a result, Iran allegedly \ndragged its feet on setting a date for talks. \nDespite prodding from the P5+1 — \nincluding urgent efforts by Russia — in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029815 \nJanuary Iran reportedly went silent about  \ntalks. Russia, increasingly frustrated by \nthe inability of Tehran and the West to \nnegotiate seriously, vented its frustration. \n\"Some of our partners in the six powers \nand the Iranian side cannot come to an \nagreement about where to meet,\" Russian \nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a  \nnews conference. \"We are ready to meet \nat any location as soon as possible. We \nbelieve the essence of our talks is far \nmore important (than the site), and we \nhope that common sense will prevail and \nwe will stop behaving like little \nchildren.\" \nAccording to analysts in Washington, \nreinforced by comments from Iran itself, \na big reason for Tehran's recalcitrance is \nthat Iran wants to prove to the United \nStates that its vaunted sanctions regime \nwill not force Iran to make unilateral \nconcessions at the bargaining table. In \naddition, Iran is concerned that it won't \nget much in return in talks with the West, \nand that it will be asked to make \nunilateral concessions on uranium \nenrichment without getting sanctions \nrelief in return. Combined with Iranian  \ninternal divisions, as its own presidential  \nelection season gets underway, that could \nmean that for the next six months or so \nAyatollah Ali Khamenei simply won't be \nready to talk seriously, despite scheduling \nthe Kazakhstan round. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029816 \nOthers suspect that Iran is waiting to see \nhow President Obama's new national \nsecurity team — with Kerry as secretary of \nstate, Chuck Hagel as secretary of \ndefense, and John Brennan at the Central \nIntelligence Agency — will shape \nObama's stance at any talks. \nIn Washington, some would argue there's \na growing consensus, at the level of think \ntanks, Iran experts, and other analysts, \nthat a preliminary, first-round deal, \nincluding \"shop, ship, and shut,\" might \nwork, if in response the P5+1 could lift \nsome of the economic sanctions on Iran \nand agree to limited Iranian enrichment. \nPerhaps the best-case scenario is the \npossibility that there are ongoing, secret \nand back-channel talks between \nWashington and Tehran. Nothing along \nthose lines has leaked and there is no \nindication of this, yet. But in advance of \nthe first round of Iran-P5+1 talks in \nVienna in 2009, the United States and \nIran did indeed engage in quiet, behind-\nthe-scenes diplomacy. \nIn fact, of course, any sanctions relief for \nIran will occur slowly and step-by-step, \nnot all at once, in parallel with steps \ntaken by Iran and openness to more \nintrusive inspections and oversight by the \nIAEA. \nBut it's certainly not helpful that in early \nJanuary yet another round of unilateral \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029817 \nsanctions was passed by Congress and \nsigned into law by President Obama. The \ncomplex set of new measures targets key \nindustrial sectors, including shipping and \nimports of products such as aluminum, \nsteel and coal, and seeks to block Iran \nfrom using barter commodities such as \noil and gold to pay for imports. The \nWashington Post paraphrased U.S. \nofficials as saying that, \"the new policies \nare closer to a true trade embargo, \ndesigned to systematically attack and \nundercut Iran's major financial pillars \nand threaten the country with economic \ncollapse.\" Obama signed the National \nDefense Authorization Act (NDAA) that \ncontained the sanctions provisions \ndespite having hinted earlier that he \nmight veto the NDAA over a host of \nmeasures contained in the bill. \nIf the Obama administration believes that \never-tougher sanctions will cause Iran to \ncave in at the talks, it's likely that they \nare badly misreading Iranian politics. \nFor many observers, however, and for \nIran, too, the nomination of Hagel for \nsecretary of defense may be a sign that \nthe White House is beginning to realize \nthat sanctions, and threats of military \naction, won't force Iran's hand. \nAs has been widely reported, hawks, \nneoconservatives, and members of the \npro-Israel lobby in Washington have \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029818 \nslammed Hagel for his past comments \nand positions on Iran. In conjunction with \nIsrael-friendly members of Congress, \nthey've warned Obama to rein Hagel in \nso as not to send a dovish signal to \nTehran. Robert Satloff, executive \ndirection of the Washington Institute for \nNear East Policy (WINEP), a pro-Israel \nthink tank, warned bluntly that the White \nHouse should act quickly to make sure \nthat Hagel backs away from his previous \nviews on Iran and at least toes the \nadministration's tougher line. \"If the \nWhite House does not take steps soon to \ncorrect that impression, the chances for a \nnegotiated resolution of the Iran nuclear \ncrisis will fall nearly to zero and the \nlikelihood of Israeli military action will \nrise dramatically,\" he wrote. \nIndeed, within days of his nomination as \nsecretary of defense, Hagel was already \nbacking away from his earlier views, \nmeeting with senior Pentagon officials \nand influential senators who'll vote on \nhis confirmation to clarify his views on \nIran, asserting that he supports broad \ninternational sanctions against Iran and \nthat he believes that the military option \nought to be \"on the table.\" Several \nDemocratic senators who met with Hagel \nannounced with satisfaction that the \nformer senator from Nebraska had \nsufficiently backtracked or \"clarified\" his \nviews on Iran. Consequently, they \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029819 \nannounced that he had earned their \nsupport — and their vote. \nThen, during his confirmation hearings \non January 31, Hagel — under hostile \nquestioning from several Republican \nsenators — backed away from earlier-held \npositions on Iran, including the role of \nsanctions. And, though he previously \nbeen a sharp critic of a military attack on \nIran, in his opening statement Hagel said: \n\"I am fully committed to the President's \ngoal of preventing Iran from obtaining a \nnuclear weapon, and—as I've said in the \npast—all options must be on the table to \nachieve that goal. My policy is one of \nprevention, and not one of containment—\nand the President has made clear that is \nthe policy of our government. As \nSecretary of Defense, I will make sure \nthe Department is prepared for any \ncontingency.\" \nSatloff's views were echoed by another \ntough-talking official at WINEP, former \nAmbassador Dennis Ross, a pro-Israel \nhawk who served as Obama's top adviser \non Iran during much of the president's \nfirst term. \"I think 2013 is going to be \ndecisive,\" Ross told the Los Angeles  \nTimes, expressing concern about Hagel's \nprevious comments. \"Time really is \nrunning out. For diplomacy to have a \nchance of success, the Iranians need to \nunderstand that if diplomacy fails, force \nis going to be the result. We still have a \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029820 \nchallenge to convince the Iranians that \nwe're quite serious about the use of \nforce,\" he said. \"In the first term, the \nadministration didn't always speak with \none voice on this issue. So what Hagel \nsays can make a difference.\" \nDespite his poorly receieved performance  \nat his confirmation hearings, it's widely \nbelieved in Washington that Hagel will \nbe confirmed as secretary of defense and \nthat his private advice to Obama will \nmore closely hew to his long-held beliefs \nabout the futility of sanctions and the \ngrave downside to a military strike. Partly \nfor that reason, it remains very unlikely \nthat the Obama administration will resort \nto force to resolve the dispute with Iran. \nIn fact, in remarks that Iranian officials \ncited as promising, Vice President Joe \nBiden expressed the administration's \nwillingness to hold bilateral talks with the \nIranians. In response to a question at the \nMunich Security Conference Biden said, \n\"We have made it clear at the outset \nthat...we would be prepared to meet \nbilaterally with the Iranian leadership\" \nwhen Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah \nAli Khamenei is serious about \nnegotiations. Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali \nAkbar Salehi responded favorably and \nsaid, \"I am optimistic, I feel this new \nadministration is really seeking this time \nto at least divert from its previous \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029821 \ntraditional approach vis-a-vis my \ncountry.\" \nBut if Washington remains committed to \never-tougher sanctions — and without \npromising Iran that sanctions will be \nlifted as part of a deal — then negotiations \nare unlikely to succeed. Vali Nasr, \nanother former Obama administration \nofficial with expertise on Iran, suggested \nrecently that there's not much more the \nworld can do to sanction Iran, and that \nsuch penalties could drive Tehran to take \nradical action. The regime of sanctions \nagainst Iran over its nuclear activity \n\"really has reached its end,\" Nasr, dean of \nthe Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced \nInternational Studies at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, said during the World \nEconomic Forum in Davos. And he \nwarned that unless there is a diplomatic \nbreakthrough — or, alternatively, an \nattack on Iran — \"you really are looking \nat a scenario where Iran is going to rush \nvery quickly towards nuclear power, \nbecause they also think, like North \nKorea, that (then) you have much more \nleverage to get rid of these sanctions.\" \nRobert Dreyfuss is an independent, \ninvestigative journalist in the \nWashington, D.

Zoellick \nFebruary 5, 2013 -- Five years into the \nglobal economic storm, America's \ntraditional allies, theEuropean Union and \nJapan, are struggling. Developing \neconomies are reshaping the global \ndynamic but also face big challenges. The \nUnited States is the one country that \ncould lead the modernization of the \ninternational system so as to supply \nsecurity, economic opportunity, and \nprospects for liberty. America's own \nstrategy for economic revival cannot be \nlimited to the nation's borders. And its \nfuture foreign policy—its projection of \npower and principle—must be grounded \nin the emerging economic order. \nPresident Obama has said he admires \nRonald Reagan's transformative thinking. \nIf so, he should ask for an assessment of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029823 \nReagan's second-term innovations on \ncurrency and monetary affairs, trade, debt \nand development. Reagan advanced a \nnew international system to match the \nrevival of capitalism after the oil shocks \nand stagflation of the 1970s. America's \nsuccess in the 1980s contributed both to \nthe end of the Cold War, by persuading \nthe Soviet Union it could not keep up, \nand to two decades of exceptional global \ngrowth. \nThe new U.S. international economic \nstrategy should have five parts. First, this \ncountry should strengthen its continental \nbase by building on the North American \nFree Trade Agreement with Canada and \nMexico. Together, the three partners \ncould boost energy security, improve \nproductivity, and give North Americans \nan edge in manufacturing and other \nindustries that are already experiencing \nrising wages in East Asia. A politically \nacceptable immigration policy, and a \npush for educational innovation using \nnew technologies and competition, could \nlead to a more prosperous, populous, \nintegrated and democratic future for the \nhemisphere. \nSecond, the extraordinary monetary \npolicies of late, led by the Federal \nReserve's continued near-zero interest-\nrate policy, are taking us into uncharted \nterritory. Central banks have tried most \nevery tool to stimulate growth; if Japan is \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029824 \nany warning, the next tactic is \ncompetitive devaluation, which risks a \nnew protectionism. \"Currency \nmanipulation\" could become a danger \nthat reaches far beyond the debate about \nChinese policies. The world economy \nwill need at some point to withdraw the \ndrug of cheap money and negative real \ninterest rates. The U.S. should anticipate \nthese dangers. \nThe International Monetary Fund also \ncould help set standards about exchange-\nrate policies and serve as a referee that \nblows a whistle, even if it cannot \npenalize. The IMF and the World Trade \nOrganization should anticipate this risk \nand give effect to the existing WTO \nagreement that economies must \"avoid \nmanipulating exchange rates . . . to gain \nan unfair competitive advantage.\" \nThird, the U.S. needs to break the logjam \non opening markets. As the leading world \neconomy, America should initially try to \nstrengthen and increase international \ntrade through the WTO. As my \ncolleagues at the Peterson Institute have \npointed out, there are gains from the \nstymied Doha Round of trade \nnegotiations that should be harvested \nnow: ending agricultural export \nsubsidies; limiting food export controls; \neliminating tariffs and quotas for almost \nall exports of the poorest countries; \nfacilitating customs and clearance \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029825 \nprocedures; and improving the \ntransparency and speed of the system for \nsettling disputes. \nNext, the U.S. needs to keep the WTO \ncurrent with a vastly changed world \neconomy. The past WTO agreements are \nvaluable for all 158 WTO members. But \nsome economies want to go further by \nreducing barriers in important sectors \nsuch as the services trade, environmental \ngoods and services, government \nprocurement, and the digital economy. \nThe services trade, for example, is vital \nfor boosting innovation, productivity and \njobs in developing and developed \ncountries alike—but regulatory, \nlicensing, zoning and other barriers to \nservices are often equivalent to a 30% \ntariff or higher. Because liberalization in \nthe WTO has been stuck, countries have \nturned increasingly to bilateral and \nmultilateral free-trade agreements, some \nof which have addressed these newer \ntopics. The U.S. should foster the WTO \nprinciple of world-wide liberalization by \nadopting standards in various industries \nand sectors that would be open to all \neconomies that reciprocate. The WTO \nalso needs new rules for fair trading by \nstate-owned enterprises. \nYet the U.S. also should use free-trade \nagreements to open markets. Trade \ncompetition advances structural reforms \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029826 \nand growth without bigger government \nand more spending. The Obama \nadministration has talked about trans-\nPacific and trans-Atlantic accords. Yet it \nhas failed to close even one new free-\ntrade agreement. Ron Kirk, the \npresident's trade representative, said in \n2009 that the administration did not have \n\"deal fever.\" In fact, it has been \"deal \ndelinquent.\" \nFourth, gender equality is not only fair \nand right—it is smart economics. No \neconomy can reach its potential if it \noverlooks the talents of half its people. \nThe U.S. should lead in identifying \nstructural barriers in countries that hold \nback girls' and women's health, \neducation, credit, jobs and \nentrepreneurship. \nFinally, the U.S. needs to match growth \npriorities of developing economies. \nPresident Obama should expand the \nglobal food-security initiative he \nannounced in 2009 to boost agricultural \nproductivity and production across the \nvalue chain, including through the private \nsector, in sub-Saharan Africa and other \npoor regions. Infrastructure investment \ncould increase global demand today \nwhile building productivity for tomorrow. \nThe U.S. can lead a push with middle-\nincome economies to develop public-\nprivate infrastructure models that move \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029827 \nfrom \"one-offs\" to a deal flow. The zero \nreturns for savers from U.S. monetary \npolicy can make infrastructure \ninvestments attractive. \nIn addition to offering financing, the \nprivate sector can improve the design, \noperation and maintenance of \ninfrastructure. As the state of Indiana has \nshown, the federal government could \nprofitably use public-private partnerships \nfor its infrastructure, too. \nThe administration has talked about some \nof these topics. But it is oddly passive, as \nif it were hesitant to lead. State \nDepartment speeches are not enough. To \ncarve out an international economic \nstrategy, the new secretary of the \nTreasury needs to choreograph policies \nacross all U.S. departments and with \nmultilateral economic institutions. The \nU.S. had better wake up: International \neconomic strategy is the new foreign \npolicy. \nMr. Zoellick has served as president of \nthe World Bank Group, U.S. trade \nrepresentative and deputy secretary of \nstate. He is now a fellow at the Belfer \nCenter at Harvard and the Peterson \nInstitute for International Economics. \nClick here to Reply or Forward \nWhy this ad?Ads — \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029828 \nTeach English Worldwide  \nBecome an English Teacher Overseas Earn Your TESOL \nOnline at USC. \nrossieronline.usc.edu \n22.3 GB (10%) of 210.1 GBManage  \n©2013 Google - Terms & Privacy \nLast account activity: 0 minutes ago \nDetails \nTeach English Worldwide \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
