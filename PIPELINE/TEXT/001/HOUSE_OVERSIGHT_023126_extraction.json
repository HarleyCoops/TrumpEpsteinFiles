His victims have never \nhad a voice, until now. By Emily Michot I Julie K. Brown  \nA former top prosecutor involved in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case is defending his old \nboss, Alexander Acosta, whose decision to craft a secret plea deal with the wealthy \nNew York hedge fund manager has come under federal scrutiny. \nIn his first public comments on the 10-year-old case, Jeffrey H. Sloman — who at \nthe time was second in command under Acosta at the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023126 \nMiami — said prosecutors resolved the case based on the facts and evidence, and \nwhat he called \"legal impediments,\" including the belief that many of Epstein's \nteenage victims were too \"terrified\" to cooperate in the case. \n\"Given the obstacles we faced in fashioning a robust federal prosecution, we decided \nto negotiate a resolution,\" said Sloman, now in private practice. \"We did not reach \nthis decision lightly and it came only after significant and often rancorous internal \ndebate.\" \nJeffrey Sloman, who was second-in-command to then-U.S. Attorney Alexander \nAcosta when the latter was deciding whether to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein, says the \noffice handled the case properly. Aixa Montero Holt \nIn a lengthy opinion piece  submitted to the Miami Herald Editorial Board, Sloman \nalleges that the attacks on Acosta's role in the controversial case are politically \ndriven by critics who failed to raise significant issues when Acosta was nominated \nand confirmed as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017. \nSloman's comments come two weeks after the Justice Department announced it had \nopened an investigation over whether there was prosecutorial misconduct in the \ncase involving Epstein, who ran a sex pyramid scheme from his Palm Beach estate \nthat targeted scores of underage girls from 2001 to 2006. \nAbout 30 members of Congress demanded the probe following a Miami Herald \nseries of stories, \"Perversion of Justice,\" that detailed how federal prosecutors, led \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023127 \nby Acosta, stitched together an unusual immunity deal that allowed Epstein to \nescape what could have been a life sentence in federal prison. \nU.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta has been criticized for the plea deal he \nworked out with Jeffrey Epstein. Acosta was U.S. attorney for Southern Florida at \nthe time. Alan Diaz \nInstead, Epstein — whose friends included President Donald Trump, former \nPresident Bill Clinton and other politically connected people — was allowed to \nquietly plead guilty to prostitution charges in state court. He served 13 months in \nthe county jail, where he was allowed liberal work release privileges rarely given to \nsex offenders in Florida and barred by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Department's own \nrules. \nHe was released in 2009, but his victims — who were 13 to 16 years old at the time — \nare still fighting more than a decade later to have his non-prosecution agreement \noverturned. \nIn his op-ed, Sloman called Acosta \"an outstanding public servant ... at risk of \nbecoming collateral damage in Washington's latest polarized conflagration,\" adding, \n\"I won't let it happen without first being heard.\" \nJeffrey Epstein apologizes, but not to his victims \nJeffrey Epstein, a multimillionaire who molested dozens of underage girls, and is \nsuspected of trafficking countless other girls around the world, issued a public \napology Tuesday. It was not to the victims of his abuse, but to one of their lawyers. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023128 \n\"As additional details about Epstein's crimes have emerged, it is clear to me that we \nshould have pushed for much harsher terms,\" Sloman wrote. \"That said, some have \nmistakenly suggested that our office kowtowed to Epstein's high-priced defense \nlawyers or, worse, that his lawyers corrupted or intimidated us into submission. ... \nNothing could be further from the truth.\" \nSloman did not directly address the chief complaint brought by Epstein's victims, \nwho are now in their late 20S and early 30s. Those who spoke to the Herald said \nthey felt betrayed by federal prosecutors, who sealed the non-prosecution agreement \nfrom public view so that they wouldn't find out about it before he was sentenced. It \nwould be almost a year before they were successful in having it unsealed. By then, it \nwas too late to try to derail it. \nThey allege, in a federal lawsuit filed against the government, that prosecutors \ndeliberately kept the deal secret — in violation of federal law — to prevent them \nfrom appearing at Epstein's sentencing to possibly undo the deal. Nor did Sloman \naddress why prosecutors also gave immunity to a number of Epstein's co-\nconspirators, who have never been identified. \n\"They cut a deal which they have to know was a failure,\" said Marci Hamilton, a law \nprofessor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of Child USA, \nwhich advocates for children's civil liberties. \" They kept it secret and they didn't \ncharge the co-conspirators. The horror of this is if you don't hold all the 'Johns' \naccountable, then it doesn't stop. This case involved multiple girls, multiple men, \nmultiple recruiters, multiple times and he recruited girls to get other girls. That's a \ntrafficking organization.\" \nAcosta has not commented since 2011, when he defended his decisions in a publicly \nissued letter that can be found in the federal court file. In it, he described what he \ncalled a \"yearlong assault\" on prosecutors by Epstein's \"army of legal superstars,\" \nincluding Roy Black, Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz, among others. In four \nlong paragraphs, Acosta detailed how defense attorneys relentlessly worked to \nmanipulate the negotiation process, often frustrating prosecutors. \n\"They would obtain concessions as part of a negotiation and agree to proceed, only \nto change their minds, and appeal the office's decision to Washington,\" Acosta \nwrote, adding that their tactics included delving into the private family lives of \nindividual prosecutors in an effort to discredit them and get them removed from the \ncase. \nWrote Sloman: \"The Herald's 'Perversion of Justice' series presented a heartrending \nportrait of Epstein's victims and made a strong case that he should have gone to jail \nmuch longer, but never explained or substantiated its accusation that we schemed \nwith Epstein's lawyers.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023129 \nThe Herald's series quoted a trove of letters and emails between prosecutors and \nEpstein's defense team that showed that Epstein's lawyers were allowed to dictate \nthe terms of each deal that they drew up, and prosecutors repeatedly backed down \non deadlines. The lead prosecutor, Marie Villafaria, amid the negotiations wrote to \nEpstein lawyer Jay Lefkowitz: \"I thought we had worked very well together in \nresolving this dispute. ... I feel that I bent over backwards to keep in mind the effect \nthat the agreement would have on Mr. Epstein.\" \nWhere are they now? The biggest players in the Jeffrey Epstein case \nThe girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their \ncause remain angry over what they regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's \nemployees and those who engineered his non-prosecution agreement have \nprospered. \nThe email chain also shows that prosecutors sometimes communicated with the \ndefense team using private emails, and that their correspondence referenced \ndiscussions that they wanted to have by phone or in person so that there would be \nno paper trail, the Herald found. At one point, Acosta met privately with Lefkowitz, \nwho came from the same Washington, D.C.-based law firm, at a Marriott hotel in \nWest Palm Beach, the emails showed. It was at that meeting, the records show, \nwhen Acosta agreed to keep the deal secret. \nThe correspondences also show that Sloman sought several times to have Epstein's \nvictims notified about the deal, as required under the Crime Victims Rights Act. But \nafter Epstein's lawyers aggressively objected and appealed to Acosta, it never \nhappened. \nSloman, however, insisted that Epstein's lawyers' aggressive defense had no bearing \non the office's decision to set aside what court records show was a 53-page federal \nindictment it had prepared against Epstein. Sloman said the facts dictated that \nEpstein should plead guilty to what he called \"a crime in state court that reflected \nhis true conduct,\" adding that the case was \"at heart, a local sex case.\" \n\"It is a gross mischaracterization to describe this as a local sex case,\" said lawyer \nJack Scarola, a representative of several of Epstein's then-underage victims. \"There \nwas ample evidence that Epstein was operating on a large international scale. The \ninvolvement of the federal government was a consequence of evidence that children \nwere crossing national and state borders for the purpose of prostitution.\" \nAt the time that the case was closed, FBI investigators had identified nearly 40 \nvictims — and more were coming forward — who said they had been molested or \nsexually assaulted by Epstein and some of his co-conspirators. One of those victims, \nCourtney Wild, told the Herald that she brought at least 6o girls to his waterfront \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023130 \nPalm Beach estate over time. She wanted Epstein prosecuted — and was willing to \ntestify — but prosecutors never gave her the chance, she told the Herald. \nIn addition, FBI records show that agents had traveled to New York and New \nMexico to interview other possible victims, the Herald found. The non-prosecution \ndeal that was struck was filed under seal. The result was that no one — not even the \njudge — would know the full scope of Epstein's crimes and how many victims were \ninvolved. \nAcosta, who now heads a federal agency with oversight of international child labor \nlaws and human trafficking, was personally involved in the negotiations, records, \nletters and emails show. \nAG nominee Barr pledges to look into handling of Epstein case \nSen. Ben Sasse questioned attorney general nominee William Barr about the Jeffrey \nEpstein case on January 15, 2019, getting the nominee to commit to having the \nDepartment of Justice look into the handling of that case if confirmed. \nBy C-SPAN \nSloman reiterated Acosta's earlier contention that most of Epstein's victims \nwouldn't cooperate. \n\"So somehow, had Epstein been a child molester of one or two victims, then they \nwould have prosecuted him?\" said Wild's attorney, Brad Edwards, in an interview \nwith the Herald for its series published in November. \"But because he molested \nhundreds of victims and some of them wouldn't testify, then they are saying, 'we \ncan't prosecute.' How absurd is that argument?\" \nEdwards tried unsuccessfully to block the plea deal in federal court. In 2008, days \nafter Epstein was sentenced, he filed an emergency order, alleging that the \nagreement was illegal because it violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which \ngrants crime victims certain rights, including the right to confer with prosecutors \nand be notified of a plea deal. The lawsuit is still pending a decade later. \n\"There is a reason for the Crime Victims Rights Act — so that prosecutors don't \npreempt a victim's ability to speak for themselves about a proposed plea bargain,\" \nScarola said. \"Here, the decision was being made secretly for them.\" \nDARREN K.
