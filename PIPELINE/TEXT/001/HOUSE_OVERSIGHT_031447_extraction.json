WEINBERG, P.C. \nATTORNEY AT LAW \n20 PARK PLAZA, SUITE 1000 \nBOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS 02116 \nFAX \nNIGHT EMERGENCY \nAugust 19, 2015 \nVia Certified Mail  \nMelanie Ann Pustay \nDirector of Office of Information Policy \nSean R. O'Neill \nChief, Administrative Appeals Staff \nOffice of Information Policy \nUnited States Department of Justice, Suite 11050 \n1425 New York Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \nEMAIL ADDRESSES: \nRE: FBI Request No 1203982-001/ DOJ OIP Appeal AP-2013-01397 (Jeffrey \nEpstein) \nDear Ms. Pustay and Mr. O'Neill: \nOn March 29, 2013, the OIP determined that the FBI could not rely on 5 U.S.C. § \n552(b)(7)(A) as a basis to withhold all records of past investigations regarding Mr. Epstein's \nprior FBI FOIA request. On April 25, 2013, the FBI reopened the above-numbered FOIA \nrequest and stated that it had started its processing and searching for responsive records. On \nJune 24, 2013, the FBI was informed that Mr. Epstein would pay the costs of copying. At \npresent, 27 1/2 months after the FBI started to process Mr. Epstein's FOIA request, Mr. Epstein \nhas received just two \"batches,\" the first numbering 372 pages (including redactions) that was \nproduced on December 16, 2014, and the second \"batch\" numbering 336 pages that was \nproduced 5 1/2 months later on May 29, 2015, out of a file that exceeds 12,000 pages. The \nprocessing of a third \"batch\" of documents will not begin until, at earliest, October, 2015, see \ninfra. At this pace, the FBI will not complete the processing Mr. Epstein's file until 2025. A \ncitizen should not have to wait over a decade for an agency to meet its FOIA obligations. As \ndocumented below — and within the May 1, 2015, and August 13, 2015, letters to Mr. Dennis \nArgall, FBI FOIPA Public Liaison Officer, each of which are attached — the FBI has declined to \nmeet its statutory obligations in providing Freedom of Information Act mandated disclosures \nrelating to the above-numbered request without unreasonable delay. Accordingly, I appeal to the \n01P to require the FBI to comply with its March 29, 2013, determination in a reasonably prompt \nmanner. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031447 \nI spoke with Mr. Argall by telephone on August 12, 2015, and inquired as to when I \ncould expect a third interim production. He informed me that the FBI reviewer assigned to the \nEpstein file had not commenced the processing of any additional materials in the 2 months \nfollowing the May 29 production and, further, that any such review was not currently scheduled \nand would not begin until, at earliest, October 2015. Given the lengthy delays due which \ninclude second level FOIA reviews conducted in Southern Florida by either the USAO or FBI, it \npredictably will take, at the very minimum, 5 1/2 months from the prior production in May until a \nthird \"batch\" would be provided (not the 60-90 days I had repeatedly been told was the ordinary \ndelay between separate 500 page productions on large files such as Mr. Epstein's). At this pace \n— a production offewer than 500 pages out of the still unprocessed 11,000 pages each 5 1/2 \nmonths — the remaining 22 \"batches\" will not be produced for ten more years. Mr. Argall also \nadvised that the reviewer assigned to the request was processing other files and that, in essence, \nother than communicating with me (which Mr. Argall has done on a regular basis), he could not \nsuggest a way to expedite the pace other than by my advising Mr. Epstein to relinquish his FOIA \nrights to the review of his entire file. \nThe FBI response to the above-numbered FOIA request has been utterly incompatible \nwith the language of the FOIA, which states that \"[u]pon any determination by an agency to \ncomply with a request for records, the records shall be made promptly available to such person \nmaking such request,\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i)(emphasis added), and with court opinions \ndefining the FOIA \"basic policy\" as focusing on \"citizens' right to be informed about 'what their \ngovernment is up to,\" Dep't of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. \n749, 773 (1989). Additionally, the FBI's delays in this matter violate the policy of President \nObama, announced on January 21, 2009, which directed each agency to \"act promptly\" and \nmake \"timely disclosures of information.\" Even further, the Attorney General in a Memorandum \nfor the Heads of Executive Della'____tinents and Agencies dated March 19, 2009, stressed that FOIA \n\"professionals should be mindful of their obligation to work 'in a spirit of cooperation' with \nFOIA requesters,\" that \"unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles have no place in the 'new era of open \nGovernment,' and that \"timely disclosure of information is an essential component of \ntransparency [and] long delays should not be viewed as an inevitable and insurmountable \nconsequence of high demand.\" (emphasis added). The pace of disclosure where Mr. Epstein has \nreceived less than 1,000 of over 12,000 pages in the over 28 months since the OIP required the \nFBI to process his FOIA request is in stark conflict with the mandates of both the President and \nthe Attorney General. More is required than for Mr. Epstein to simply wait, year after year, for \nthe FBI to comply with its FOIA obligations. \nIn a recent opinion, Clemente v. FBI, 71 F.Supp.3d 262 (D.D.C. 2014), Judge Hogan found that \nthe \"FBI is not 'deluged with [a] volume of requests . . vastly in excess of that anticipated by \nCongress,' that the \"FBI has not shown exceptional circumstance or sufficient progress in \nreducing its backlog to warrant an Open America stay,\" and that although the plaintiff's request \n\"that the FBI process 5,000 pages a month is higher than the rate would be in an ordinary \ncase, . . . the FBI has successfully processed documents at that rate in other cases.\" Mr. Epstein \nacknowledges the differences between his case and that of plaintiff Clemente, however, an \nagreement that his file be processed at even 10% of the 5,000 pages a month ordered in the \nClemente case would speed up the production of his FOIA file by many multiples given that Mr. \n2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031448 \nI would request that you intervene in this matter and require that the FBI agree to a \nprocedure that expedites the production of the 12,000 page file. I would also request a \nconference with you and/or with the specific individuals who will be responsible for discharging \nthe FBI's FOIA responsibilities as to the pending Epstein request for FOTA materials so that I \ncan be assured that the FBI will be discharging its legal obligations without continued unlawful \nand inexplicable delay. \nYours trtily _ \nMartin G. n erg \ncc: James A. Baker \nGeneral Counsel \nFederal Bureau of Investigation \n935 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20535 \nEpstein, after 28 months, has received just over 700 pages of redacted documents out of a file of \nover 12,000 pages. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031449 \n"
