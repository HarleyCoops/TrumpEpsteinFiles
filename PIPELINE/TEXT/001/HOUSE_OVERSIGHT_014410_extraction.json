We expect growth of 1.4% in CY2017 and 1.2% in\nCY2018, well above consensus of just 0.8% growth next year. For the first time in four\nyears both monetary and fiscal policy are supporting growth. The combination of\nmodestly higher commodity prices, a weaker yen, and a tightening output gap should\ndrive Japan-style core inflation to 1.0% in CY2017, and 1.4% in CY2018. We expect the\nBoJ to keep its rate targets unchanged for the foreseeable future as inflation moves in\nthe right direction.\nFiscal and monetary policy realigning\nFor years Japan has oscillated between loose and tight fiscal policy. Japanese\npolicymakers now seem to be on the same page and we see little risk of another policy\nerror. If anything, we see upside risks from greater fiscal stimulus via a third\nsupplementary budget or a relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget. Meanwhile, the\nBoJ’s new interest-pegging regime ensures that financial conditions will become\nincreasingly stimulatory as inflation rises.\nEconomics\nJapan\nIzumi Devalier\nJapan Economist\nMerrill Lynch (Japan)\n+81 3 6225 6257\nizumi.devalier@baml.com\n2017 – a year of recovering domestic demand\nWe think the economy is heading towards a cyclical sweet spot and see a broad-based\nrecovery in domestic demand. Specifically, 1) consumption is poised to rebound as the\nsaving rate peaks; 2) capex should accelerate in response to the improving demand\noutlook, deepening supply-side constraints, and “low-for-longer” real rates; and 3)\nincreased efforts by policymakers to accelerate income redistribution could push up the\nvelocity of money at the margin, helping to reflate the economy.\nUnauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\nBiggest risk factor: US policy uncertainty\nExternal developments pose the greatest risk to our forecasts, chief among them US\npolicy uncertainty. The downside scenario for Japan is a combination of rising US\nprotectionism, sliding global trade, and a stronger yen, which could reduce 2017 growth\nto zero. The Trump presidency may increase pressure on Japan to achieve greater\nmilitary self-reliance, boosting defense spending. There will also be greater incentives to\ndeepen economic and trade linkages with key regional players, such as China and Russia.\nChart 1: We think consensus is underestimating the strength of medium-term GDP and inflation\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\nReal GDP %YoY\n0.7\n0.6\n1.4\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts, Bloomberg\n1.2\n0.8 0.7\nCY16 CY17 CY18 CY16 CY17 CY18\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.

Growth accelerated to an aboveconsensus\n2.2% q-o-q saar, after a 0.7% rise in Q2 CY16 and 2.1% rise in Q1 CY16. We\nexpect a moderation in Q4 CY16, but underlying growth will remain firmly in the 1.0-\n1.5% range. We are currently tracking CY2016 growth of 0.7%, a modest improvement\nfrom 0.6% in CY2015, though the switch to a new GDP standard 1 next month raises\nuncertainty around our forecasts.\nUpturn in exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17\nThe recent recovery has been driven by a fading consumption tax shock and stronger\nexports. The downturn in the global industrial cycle in 2014-16 hurt Japan, but\nmanufacturing activity bottomed out early this year and is now modestly expanding\n(Chart 2). The OECD leading indicator continues to signal a synchronized pick-up in\nglobal growth (Chart 3). The domestic inventory cycle also points to production gains\nahead (Chart 4). For Japanese exporters, the improvement in demand has been most\nvisible for Europe (Chart 5). US and Chinese demand will likely follow, though the\nmainland’s structural shift to services implies only a modest acceleration. We expect the\ncurrent up-cycle in global exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17 – possibly longer\ndepending on developments in the US (more on this later). The combination of stronger\nexternal demand and a weaker currency should shore up business confidence, especially\namong manufacturers, and lay the foundations of Japan’s recovery.\nChart 2: Industrial activity has bottomed out\nIndex 2010=100 3mma sa\n110\n105\n100\n95\n90\n85\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\nIP Real exports\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, METI, BoJ\nChart 3: OECD leading indicator points to modest global expansion\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\nOECD global leading indicator, %YoY (LHS)\nJapan real exports, %YoY (RHS)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, OECD, BoJ\n50\n30\n10\n-10\n-30\n-50\nChart 4: The shipment-inventory cycle points to production gains ahead\nShipments %YoY\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\nMar 2013\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, METI\nSep 2016\n-10 -5 0 5 10\nInventories %YoY\nChart 5: Japan's real exports by destination, 3mma %YoY\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n-20\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nN.

There are good reasons to be cautiously optimistic: after all, despite a triple\nwhammy of weak domestic demand, weak commodity prices, and a stronger yen,\nJapanese inflation measures are showing early signs of bottoming out (Chart 6).\nWe expect Japan-style core inflation (CPI ex fresh food) to trough in Q4 CY16, after\nwhich it should accelerate relatively quickly in the first two quarters of 2017 in response\nto 1) a recovery in crude oil prices, 2) a weaker yen (we assume USDJPY rebounds to\n120 by the end of the year), and 3) stronger wage growth. This also implies stronger\ncore-core inflation (CPI ex food & energy). We are bullish on all three factors and see\nCY17 core inflation running at an above-consensus 1.0% and 1.4% in CY18.\nThis is still short of the central bank’s 2% target (Chart 7). But we believe there will be\nlittle pressure to lower rates further, especially against the backdrop of a weakening yen\nand rising global yields. More broadly, things are moving in the right direction for the\nBoJ. The private sector has been steadily re-leveraging, albeit gradually. Meanwhile,\nlabor markets continue to tighten and wage growth is slowly improving: the 4-quarter\nmoving average for hourly wages is now up to 1.2% y-o-y (Chart 8). With the labor\nmarket for lower-cost part-time workers nearing saturation, growth in higher-quality,\nfull-time jobs is picking up (Chart 9). We expect a moderation in employment gains and\nfaster wage growth ahead.\nChart 6: Produce and consumer price inflation (ex-tax effect)\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nCorporate goods prices %YoY (LHS)\nHeadline CPI %YoY (LHS)\nCorporate service prices %YoY (RHS)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MIA\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n-1.5\nChart 7: Japan-style core inflation (CPI ex fresh food) forecasts (FY basis)\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n-1.0\n-2.0\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nBoJ BofAML Consensus Target\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, BoJ, JCER *Consensus is JCER ESP survey\nChart 8: Wage growth is picking up on the back of tight labor markets\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\nChart 9: Full-time job growth is accelerating\n3.0\nAbenomics\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n-1.0\n-2.0\n-3.0\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\nHourly wages, %YoY 4qtr ma\nUS-style core inflation (ex-tax), %YoY 4qtr ma\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MHLW, MIA\nPart-time, ppt contribution\nTotal employment, %YoY\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MIA\nFull-time, ppt contribution\nJapan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016 3\nFiscal policy: turning looser In FY17\nFiscal policy is undergoing an equally important shift. In August, the Cabinet approved\nan economic stimulus package totaling JPY28trn (roughly 5.5% of GDP). Though “real\nwater” government spending is a comparatively modest JPY7.5trn (1.5% of GDP), this is\nenough to put the fiscal impulse back in expansionary territory, after three years of\ntightening (Chart 10). The stimulus measures, which are centered on public investment\nand cash transfers to households, should boost CY2017 GDP by 0.5ppt. Public\nconstruction orders are already rebounding as the government front-loaded public\ninfrastructure spending (Chart 11). Meanwhile, the next stage of the consumption tax\nincrease has been postponed until October 2019.\nChart 10: After 3 years of tightening, fiscal policy to turn loose in FY17\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, IMF, CAO\nTo be clear, we are not talking about massive shifts in the fiscal stance here—the\nMinistry of Finance remains very much opposed to expanding the deficit and Prime\nMinister Abe has yet to abandon the government’s long-standing goal of balancing the\nprimary balance by FY2020.\nHowever, there is a growing consensus among Japanese policymakers that premature\nfiscal tightening is counter-productive for reflation efforts, especially when monetary\npolicy is stretched. Even BoJ Governor Kuroda, who initially underplayed the risks from\n2014 fiscal tightening, has recently acknowledged that loose monetary and fiscal\npolicies will have a “synergistic effect.” The upshot is that the risk of another policy\nerror is low, in our view. If anything, we see upside risks from greater fiscal stimulus in\nthe form of a third supplementary budget or relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget.\nWe would not rule out further delays to the October 2019 consumption tax hike, either.\nChart 11: Public investment is poised to pick up in the months ahead\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\nForecasts\nFY10 FY11 FY12 FY13 FY14 FY15 f FY16 f FY17 f\nFiscal impulse (change in cyclically-adjusted primary balance), % GDP\n-20\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nPublic construction orders received %YoY 3mma\nPublic construction orders completed %YoY 3mma\nContractionary\nExpansionary\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MITI\n4 Japan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016\n2017: a good year for domestic demand\nPolicy tailwinds are only one pillar of our call for Japan’s outperformance in 2017. We\nalso believe the stars are aligning for an organic improvement in domestic demand,\nwhich would support the current recovery: the economy is firing on all cylinders for the\nfirst time since 2013, and growth should accelerate to 1.4% in CY2017, followed by\n1.2% expansion in CY2018 (Chart 12).\nWe see three catalysts: a consumer comeback, stronger capex, and a shift in income\naway from high-saving corporations in favour of higher-spending households and\nstockholders.\nChart 12: Steady improvement in growth, led by domestic demand\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n-1.0\nBofAMLForecasts\n-2.0\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nPrivate demand Public demand Net exports Real GDP growth %YoY\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts, CAO\n1. Consumer comeback\nHouseholds have been the noticeable laggard in the current recovery and the main\nreason why Japan’s economy has barely grown since the 2014 consumption tax hike.\nThis is not for a lack of income growth: real employee compensation (wages +\nemployment) has staged an impressive recovery of late, rising 1.2% in CY15, and an\nestimated 1.9% in CY16 (Chart 13).\nOne explanation is that private consumption is simply being underestimated in demandside\nGDP statistics: researchers at the Bank of Japan recently produced experimental\nsupply-side estimates of GDP that were significantly higher than existing expenditureside\nstatistics. 2 We find the BoJ research interesting and agree that Japanese\nconsumption statistics are beset by data quality issues. But this alone cannot account\nfor the consumption slump. We think two factors are equally to blame for depressed\nhousehold spending: 1) a squeeze on disposable income from higher taxes and social\nsecurity contributions; and 2) a surge in the saving rate (Chart 14).\nCalling Japan right in 2017 is largely about correctly forecasting whether these two\ntrends will reverse. We see several reasons for optimism. First, we expect real employee\ncompensation to accelerate further, driven by a continued pick-up in per capita wages.\nThe call on the saving rate is admittedly trickier. But having surpassed the 2006 highs,\nwe think it is unlikely to surge further, given that consumer confidence is improving and\nincome growth is firming. FY17 tax reforms are also likely to support household\nsentiment at the margin: for example, discussions are underway about enlarging tax cuts\nfor second-earners who work part-time. Overall, we expect private consumption to rise\n1.0% in CY17, adding 0.6ppt to growth.\nShould the saving rate stabilize, as we expect, consumption should again start rising in\ntandem with compensation. Investors should not have to wait long to get some visibility\naround these trends. We expect the saving rate to peak in Q4 CY16 and consumption to\nrise strongly from this quarter.\n2\nLink to the research paper (in Japanese only):\nhttps://www.boj.or.jp/research/wps_rev/wps_2016/data/wp16j09.pdf\nJapan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016 5\nChart 13: Real labor income and private consumption\nChart 14: Workers' saving rate at all-time high\n270\n265\n260\n255\n250\n245\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n330\n320\n310\n300\n290\n280\n22\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n1970\n1973\n1976\n1979\n1982\n1985\n1988\n1991\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n2012\n2015\nReal employee compensation, JPY trn saar (LHS)\nPrivate consumption, JPY trn saar (RHS)\nSaving rate of workers' households, % 4qtr ma\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, CAO\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MIA\n2. Capex revival\nWe also see a fundamental case for higher capital spending. Borrowing rates are very\nlow and will fall further in real terms as inflation rises. Stronger growth and improved\nconfidence should also encourage higher capex. And deepening supply-side constraints\noffer a strong incentive for Japan Inc. to accelerate productivity-enhancing capex,\nensuring that this expansion is durable.\nFor these reasons, we think that the impulse of capital expenditures will likely be higher\nin the non-manufacturing sector, where capacity utilization rates are higher, and labor\nshortages (and hence wage pressures) are more acute (Chart 15 and Chart 16).\nChart 15: Capacity utilization rates by sector\nChart 16: Labor shortages by sector\n-10\nInsufficient\n-40\nInsufficient\n0\n-20\n10\n0\n20\n20\n30\nExcess\n40\n2003 2005 2006 2007 2008 2010 2011 2012 2013 2015 2016\nBoJ Tankan production capacity - manufacturing, DI\nBoJ Tankan production capacity - non-manufacturing, DI\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, BoJ\n40\nExcess\n60\n2003 2005 2006 2007 2008 2010 2011 2012 2013 2015 2016\nBoJ Tankan employment conditions - manufacturing, DI\nBoJ Tankan employment conditions - non-manufacturing, DI\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, BoJ\nChart 17 shows the ratio of personnel costs to sales, using MoF corporate survey data.\nThe ratio is particularly high for lodging & accommodations (23%), eating & drinking\nservices (27%), medical, healthcare & welfare (37%) and education & learning support\n(37%). Somewhat surprisingly, personnel expenses are fairly restrained in retail. But this\nis partly due to the relatively heavy reliance on lower-cost part-time workers. Given the\nrapid growth in part-timers’ wages, such cost savings is likely to become increasingly\ndifficult to maintain.\n6 Japan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016\nChart 17: Personnel costs to sales, % ratio 4qtr ma (as of Apr-Jun 2016)\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MoF\nAnalysis by METI suggests that many of these non-manufacturing industries have the\nscope to raise productivity. Wholesale/retail, utilities, and eating & accommodation have\nparticularly low levels of productivity relative to the US (Chart 18). We think the solution\nis to boost capex, especially in ICT and automation. More broadly, an acceleration in\ncapex is needed if we are to see a pick-up in productivity and sustained profits. Though\nwe are by no means in the late stages of the profit cycle, the trend clearly points to\nhigher wage costs going forward, requiring proactive efficiency-enhancing investment\nby corporates. Bottom-up data capex data for MSCI Japan also suggest that the\ninvestment cycle has troughed and will pick up next year as earnings momentum\nimproves (Chart 19).\nChart 18: Japan's labor productivity relative to the US: services is low\nChart 19: Capex – YoY change in Japan vs Global Earnings Revisions\n(2003-07)\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, METI\n3. Policy priorities and redistribution\nWe think an increase in government pressure on corporations could speed up income\nredistribution at the margin, ensuring that money circulates to those sectors and agents\nwith a higher propensity to consume. Elevated corporate savings remain a focal point\nfor the government. Cabinet Office officials have used the concept of the “cash-out\nratio” 3 to highlight the creaky transmission from corporate profits to spending.

The measure is defined as cash out / cash and deposits. The numerator\nincludes capex, personnel expenses, R&D, dividends, and changes in equity investments in related\ncompanies. The denominator includes cash and deposits, and securities, short-term lending, and\ninvestment securities classified under liquid assets. Since we are restricted to Ministry of Finance\nCorporate survey data, our version of the “cash-out ratio” is defined as capex + personnel costs +\ndividends / cash and liquid assets.\nJapan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016 7\nshows that this measure has been on a steady downtrend, with the numbers particularly\nlow for large corporates.\nSo far, the government’s approach has relied more on carrots than sticks, with Prime\nMinister Abe using a combination of moral suasion and sweeteners to encourage firms\nto disgorge profits. The pattern has continued as we approach FY2017. For example,\nlocal media have reported that the government is considering offering corporate tax\nbreaks to SMEs that raise wages, in light of more modest wage growth at SMEs.\nDiscussions are also underway in the Prime Minister’s office about reforming working\npractices with the immediate focus on “Equal Pay for Equal work (EPEW)”—i.e. reducing\nthe wage gap between regular and non-regular employees.\nBut the issue is contentious from both a capital and labour perspective. And considering\nthe time it will likely take for related legislation to pass in the Diet, we think the lack of\ncompliance mechanisms may mean that the immediate impact of EPEW will be limited.\nInstead, the debate seems to have shifted towards limiting excessive and unproductive\novertime work. This is low-hanging fruit that does not address the issue of Japan’s\nlabour market rigidities, which are at the heart of the problem of suppressed wages and\nweak household spending power.\nThat said, there are signs that the government’s patience is wearing thin and that the\nPrime Minister is increasingly leaning towards direct intervention. For example, the\ngovernment has already delivered a minimum wage hike in FY2016 and plans to take the\nnational average up to JPY1,000 by 2020 via yearly hikes of 3%. These policy changes\nshould offer small tailwinds for the recovery in private consumption. We also think the\ndebate over a possible retained earnings tax is unlikely to go away. We are sceptical it\nwill be introduced in this year’s tax reforms. However, the government’s escalating war\non corporates hoarding cash is likely to lead to a continued rise in dividend payouts and\nshare buybacks (Chart 21).\nChart 20: Firms' cash-out ratio*, % 4qtr ma\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\nChart 21: Dividends and share buybacks by Japanese firms (TSE 1st\nsection listed)\n(JPY trn)\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0%\n1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\nAll firm sizes Large firms Small firms\n0\nDividend\nShare buyback\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MoF *The cash-out ratio is defined as personnel\nexpenses, capex, and dividend payouts as a share of cash and liquid asset balances\nSource: Nikkei Astra, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nNote: FY2016 dividend is companies' guidance.

Specifically,\nwe see higher uncertainty over global trade, risk sentiment, and FX as a result of\npolitical transitions in the US and Eurozone. We consider multiple policy scenarios under\na Trump presidency.\nTrump’s campaign promises have mixed implications for Japan. On a positive note\nderegulation, tax cuts, and aggressive infrastructure spending could boost US aggregate\n8 Japan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016\ndemand. Our US economics team expects the stimulus to boost growth in H2 CY17 and\nlikely CY18. Japan should be a big winner from stronger US growth, given its high\nexposure to the US economy in terms of exports and corporate profits (Chart 22 and\nChart 23). On the negative side, aggressive protectionist trade measures, if\nimplemented, would depress US growth and global trade further. If combined with a\nstronger yen, Japan’s economy would be hit hard.\nChart 22: Japan's export exposure (% of total gross and value-added\nexports*)\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nSource: OECD\nUSA CHN KOR TWN GER\nGross exports\nValue-added basis\nChart 23: Breakdown of Japan exports to US by commodity, 2015\n6% 7%\n12%\n22%\n39%\n14%\nChemicals Manufactured goods Machinery\nElectrical Machinery Transport equipment Others\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MoF\nBase case: “benign Trump” scenario\nFor the moment, we are assuming limited positive and negative policy changes. Our US\nteam expects uncertainty to cause a modest slowing of growth in the first half of next\nyear, but this will be more than offset by fiscal stimulus in the second half and into\n2018. But the size of the fiscal expansion will likely be smaller than promised, and the\nintroduction of modest protectionist measures means that the boost to global trade will\nessentially be zero. Table 1 shows the impact on growth under two scenarios, based on\ndifferent assumptions for global trade and FX. Under the upside case, Japan’s GDP could\nrebound towards 2%, as the economy benefits from a combination of stronger global\ntrade and a weak currency. Under a downside “protectionist” scenario, 2017 growth\nwould slow to around zero and would most likely tip Japan back into deflation.\nTable 1: Sensitivity of Japan's growth to global trade and foreign exchange rate\n(Assumptions) Baseline Case 1 - Upside Case 2 - Downside\nGlobal trade 0.0% 3.0% -10.0%\n% JPY appreciation (*) -7.0% -10.0% 10.0%\n(Simulation results) Change (Contribution) Change (Contribution) Change (Contribution)\n(**) (**) (**)\nReal GDP impact 0.2ppt - 0.9ppt - -1.4ppt -\nConsumption 0.0% (0.02ppt) 0.3% (0.15ppt) -0.8% (-0.44ppt)\nCapex 1.9% (0.26ppt) 2.9% (0.40ppt) -3.2% (-0.44ppt)\nNet Exports - (0.00ppt) - (0.30ppt) - (-0.23ppt)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, CAO, MoF, IMF\n(*) Rate of appreciation of Japanese yen in terms of effective exchange rate\n(**) Contributions to the change in real GDP\nPolitical impact of a Trump administration\nFor Japan, the impact of Trump’s election goes beyond economic issues.

There is a lot of uncertainty as to how far Trump will go to redefine\nthe US-Japan alliance. Despite his criticism, Japan already pays about 75% of US\nmilitary hosting costs. However, it seems fair to assume that Japan will be expected to\nJapan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016 9\nincrease its defense spending. Under Prime Minister Abe, the defense budget has\nexpanded by 7% but has been kept at roughly 1% of GDP, in keeping with historical\nguidelines. This is small by international standards and more likely than not will rise in\nthe coming years (Chart 24). The composition of spending is also likely to shift from\noperating costs towards procurement, which is currently a very small part of the budget\n(Chart 25).\nChart 24: Military spending % of GDP as of 2015—Japan's is low by int'l\nstandards\n6\n5\n4\nChart 25: Breakdown of Japan's defense-related expenditures\n100%\n50%\n3\n2\n1\n0\nJP UK AU CH FR KR US RU\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, World Bank\n0%\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nJP R&D, facility development, maintenance etc.\nJP procurement of equipment\nJP personnel and food provisions\nU.S.Forces Japan-related cost\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Ministry of Defense\nTPP and trade policy: potential for linkages with other regional players\nTrump and his aides have made it clear that they consider the Trans Pacific Partnership\n(TPP) to be a “bad deal.” Media have reported that President Obama is not considering\npushing the deal through a lame duck Congress. This means the deal is likely dead in its\ncurrent form.\nWhile negative for Japan, the expected withdrawal of the US from TPP could spur new\narrangements with regional partners. One potential positive is the prospect of improved\neconomic and trade linkages with other key players in the region, including Russia and\neven China. Three upcoming events are worth monitoring closely (Table 2): first, the 19-\n20 November APEC Summit in Lima, Peru, where we are likely to see vigorous\ndiscussions on the future of the TPP as well as further progress on the Regional\nComprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP); second, the 15 December Abe-Putin\nSummit, in Yamaguchi prefecture; and third a potential trilateral summit between Japan,\nChina, and Korea, which onshore media now say is being scheduled for 19-20 December,\nthough it may not happen given the unfolding leadership upheaval in Korea.\nBullish bottom line – don’t underestimate the recovery\nWe are optimistic on Japan and think the acceleration in GDP and inflation in 2017 will\nbe much stronger than consensus expects. For the first time since 2013, fiscal and\nmonetary policy will be lined up in the same expansionary direction. The global export\ncycle has turned and is now tracking modest expansion. Meanwhile, the headwinds to\ndomestic demand are finally turning into tailwinds. Unlike in the past, we think the risks\nof a policy error are low. Assuming that external risks are kept at bay, we think Japan will\nsurprise with the strength of its recovery.\n10 Japan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016\nTable 2: Calendar of political events\nDate\n2016\nSep 26 - Nov 30 (to be extended)\nNov 15\nNov 17\nNov 19-20\nDec 8\nDec 15-16\nDec 24\nEvent\nExtraordinary Diet session (supplementary budget, TPP, tax-hike delay, casino bill)\nJapan-Russia trade officials meet (Tokyo)\nAbe, Trump meet in New York\nAbe, Putin meet at APEC (progress on territorial issue a key public concern)\nJul-Sep GDP 2nd preliminary (change to 2008SNA)\nOutline of FY2017 Tax Reform to be released\nRussia's Putin to visit Abe in Yamaguchi prefecture\nCabinet to compile FY17 budget\n2017\nOrdinary Diet session (Jan)\nLDP annual convention (Mar 5)\nTokyo parliamentary election (summer)\n2018 and later\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nGovernor Kuroda's term ends (Apr)\n2018\nAbe's second term as LDP President ends (Sep)\nLower House election if no snap election before (Dec)\nNationwide local elections (spring)\n2019\nUpper house election (summer)\nConsumption tax hike (Oct)\n2020 Tokyo Olympics\n2021 LDP Presidential term ends\nJapan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016 11\nTable 3: Economic forecast summary\nCalendar Year Fiscal Year Quarterly\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2015 2016 2017 2018 3Q16 4Q16 1Q17 2Q17 3Q17 4Q17 1Q18\n(A) (F) (F) (F) (A) (F) (F) (F) (A) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F) (F)\nReal GDP (%,qoq ann.) 0.6 0.7 1.4 1.2 0.9 1.1 1.4 1.2 2.2 0.3 2.1 1.5 1.0 2.4 -0.1\nPrivate Consumption (%,qoq ann.) -1.2 0.4 1.0 1.2 -0.1 0.6 1.1 1.3 0.2 1.0 1.2 1.0 1.4 1.4 0.8\nPrivate Capex (%,qoq ann.) 1.6 0.6 1.7 3.2 2.1 0.7 2.4 2.9 0.1 5.0 -0.8 1.4 2.5 7.0 3.1\nPrivate Resid.
