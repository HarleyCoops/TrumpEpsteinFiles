Read below from David Hayes at the Mayo Clinic. How do I get David's email to \nBiden? Thanks \nSent from my iPad \nBruce Moskowitz M.D. \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: \"Hayes, David L., M.D.\" < \nDate: June 30, 2016 at 8:57:26 AM EDT \nTo: \"Bruce Moskowitz \nSubject: Research App \n)\" < \nBruce — thought of you when watching the evening news yesterday. Joe Biden was being interviewed about his work on \n\"Cancer Moonshot\" or something like that. He said that they were working on or planned to work on a database/app \nthat has never before been done, that would allow a patient or a physician to see who was doing research on a specific \ntumor anywhere in the world. \nYou've already got it. You have connections everywhere, you should get to Biden on that work group. \nDavid \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025944 \n"
