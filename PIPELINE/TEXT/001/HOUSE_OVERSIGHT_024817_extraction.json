This strong\nconsumer interest is validated by the growing number of brands and form factors that are\nnow available through increasingly diverse retail channels, including Amazon, Sephora and\nNeiman Marcus. That said, consumption of CBD on-premise will likely take longer, given\nregulatory uncertainty. And, while our analysis primarily focuses on consumer staples\napplications for CBD, it is interesting to see a growing number of specialty apparel brands\nembrace hemp as a sustainable textile.\nRetail sales of CBD consumer products in 2018 have been estimated between ~$600 mm\nand $2 bn. By 2025, we believe CBD offerings could conservatively generate $16 bn in retail\nsales (assuming a ~40% increase in consumer incidence, to 10%, and spend of less than $2 /\nday). Our bottom-up analysis anticipates a diverse category, that is still led by traditional\nhealth & wellness form factors (e.g., $6.4 bn in nutraceuticals, and $4 bn in topicals). And,\nwhile likely smaller, we also expect categories like food, beverages, beauty and vapor to all\ngenerate sales between ~$1-2.5 bn by 2025.\nHerein, we offer a detailed look at category brand and pricing architecture in the U.S.\nCBD market today, as well as detailed discussions of 21 public and private operators that\ncurrently have exposure to the category, including Outperform rated Canopy Growth, Tilray\nand Turning Point Brands, which have all announced plans to enter the U.S. CBD market.\nThe Science of CBD (Nadeau)\nCannabis’s therapeutic potential is attributable to the valuable overlap between\nphytocannabinoids (i.e. plant-derived cannabinoids) and the endogenous cannabinoid\nsystem in humans, termed a “therapeutic handshake.” While THC's activity in the body is\nfairly well elucidated, CBD’s pharmacokinetics are less well understood (no specific receptor\nfor CBD has been identified). Clinical trial results to date demonstrate few adverse effects\nfrom oral CBD doses of up to 1500 mg/day or up to 30mg IV. The scientific understanding\nof CBD’s clinical effects is based mostly on studies in specific indications, like epilepsy. GW\nPharma’s Epidiolex (highly potent, pure formulation of CBD) was approved by the FDA in\n2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet\nsyndrome, and other companies (Tilray, MMJ Phytotech, Insys) have clinical trials underway\nin seizure disorders as well.\nCBD Hemp Cultivation (Neivert)\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 41 states have set up cultivation\nand production programs to regulate the production of hemp. There is little research on\nCBD hemp cultivation methods as hemp cultivation research historically has focused on\nfiber and grain/seed. This lack of research, combined with a number of variables that affect\nhemp for CBD yield, makes hemp for CBD cultivation much more art than science at this\npoint. That said, no other crop in the U.S. offers the type of return of the CBD Plasticulture\nModel, and we would thus expect the country's two largest crops, corn and soybeans, to\nlose some acreage to CBD hemp.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

Synthetic biology methods, which harness\nfermentation to produce cannabinoids, are particularly attractive considering they can\npotentially produce a variety of cannabinoids while being highly scalable, efficient, and\nenvironmentally friendly.\nWhile QA/QC testing standards for CBD currently vary greatly by state (if any exist\nat all), we expect Life Science Tools companies to benefit from this nascent market\nopportunity as testing regulations are implemented and standardized. Similar to medical/\nrecreational cannabis testing, instruments such as mass spectrometers and liquid/gas\nchromatographs are utilized to analyze CBD samples. Key vendors for mass spectrometry\nand chromatography instruments include Agilent, Danaher (SCIEX), PerkinElmer, Shimadzu,\nThermo Fisher, and Waters Corporation.\nCBD From a Retailer and Payor Perspective (Rhyee)\nHealthcare: Drug Retailer Perspective: CBD products appear to be gaining traction with\nindependent pharmacies, many of whom are already selling or planning to sell CBD oils.\nIndependent pharmacies likely find the high-margin profile of CBD oils attractive, which\nwe suspect is similar to those of more traditional over-the-counter drugs, as well as the\ndifferentiation it affords independents relative to larger chain pharmacies. For those selling\nCBD oils today, the focus is on quality, particularly as it relates to bioavailability. Large\npharmacy chains, such as CVS and Walgreens, don’t currently sell CBD oil, but WBA noted it\nis monitoring the CBD market.\nHealthcare: Payor Perspective: Generally speaking, managed care does not cover OTC\nproducts, with the same being true for Medicare and Medicaid. Based on our conversations\nwith a number of payors, whether CBD oils will be covered as a medical benefit by\ngovernment sponsored health programs is determined by the Center for Medicare and\nMedicaid Services (CMS) and state governments. Currently, CBD products are not a covered\nbenefit, or an extra benefit, that has been approved by CMS or states, and it isn’t known\nat this time whether CMS or states governments are considering reimbursement for CBD\nproducts. Separately, Payors noted three factors complicating commercial coverage of\nCBD oils, including (1) legal issues, as CBD oils derived from THC (cannabis) isn’t legal if\nit contains equal to or more than 0.3% THC; (2) lack of regulation by the FDA; and (3) its\navailability as an OTC medication.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

In Europe, CBD\nproducts are now widely available in markets like the U.K., Italy and Switzerland, though\nregulations vary with Italy allowing for \"cannabis light\" products, with allowable THC of as\nmuch as 0.6%, while in Switzerland CBD products can have as much as 1% THC, and are\nclassified as a tobacco substitute. In Latin America, hemp has been in production since the\n1500s is also rapidly expanding their regulatory frameworks around marijuana and hemp.\nCanadian licensed producers have been actively entering the market in Latin America to\ncapitalize on this evolving opportunity, including Canopy Growth, Tilray, Aurora and Cronos.\nRegulatory Outlook (Eric Assaraf - Cowen Washington Research Group)\nThe 2018 Farm Bill declassifies industrial hemp as a Schedule I substance, shifts regulatory\nauthority from the DEA to the Department of Agriculture, and provides autonomy for\nstates to regulate the industry. However, the new law does not change the FDA's oversight\nauthority over CBD products and FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has made it clear that\nhis agency will continue to step in when certain health claims are made. Additionally, FDA\nhas stated that CBD cannot be added to food products sold across state lines or marketed\nas a dietary supplement, regardless of whether it is hemp-derived. The FDA will explore\nnew pathways for CBD to be sold legally; however, it seems clear that there will be a period\nof regulatory uncertainty over CBD products at the state and federal level.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

And, the opportunity is increasingly drawing the attention of larger\ncompetitors (where for instance, WEED announced that they would consider spending\nas much as $500 mm in U.S. hemp / CBD). By 2025, we estimate that the U.S. CBD\nmarket could approach $16 bn (from $600 mm -$2 bn in 2018).\nHerein, we offer our views of:\n1. Consumer Products Market Sizing (Azer)\n2.

Indeed, to put the 6.9% incidence rate in context, that\ncompares to JUUL use of 4.2%, and 19.6% of consumers that consider themselves a\ncurrent tobacco user, per our survey.\nFrom a user perspective, category engagement not surprisingly skews younger, with use\namong 18-24 and 25-34 year olds at over 9%, while it is below 4% for consumers 55+.\nFigure 1 CBD Use Over-Indexes to Consumers Aged 18-34\n10.0%\n8.0%\n6.0%\n4.0%\n2.0%\n0.0%\n6.9%\nDo You Use CBD as a Supplement?\n9.2% 9.5%\n7.8%\n6.4%\n3.7%\nTotal 18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55+\nSource: Cowen Survey, n=~2500, January 2019\nWhile the category remains nascent (with revenue estimates ranging from $600 mm to\n$2 bn in 2018) it seems clear that the abundance of choice, which we discuss in more\ndetail herein, has been a key driver of that consumer engagement. In particular, we\nwere surprised to see that beverages already account for close to 20% of reported form\nfactor use, given that this segment is among the newer offerings in the market place.\nMeanwhile, tinctures, which were arguably one of the original delivery systems, has a\ndominant 44% share.\nFigure 2 Tinctures Are the Most Popular Delivery Mechanism\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

With growing consumer awareness, we conservatively\nbelieve that CBD use can grow to 10% of adults in the U.S., or ~25 mm consumers (using\ncurrent population) by 2025. If we assume that the average consumer ultimately spends\n$640 per year (or less than $2 / day), that would imply a $16 bn market opportunity for\nCBD. We would note that using the U.S. Census 18+ population projection in 2025, a\n10% incidence rate would equate to just over $590 in annual spend to achieve $16 bn.\nConversely, holding the $640 in spend constant with the U.S. Census forecasted\npopulation would result in over $17 bn in revenues by 2025.\nThat said, we view this estimate as somewhat conservative, as we can envision a\nscenario where a consumer that uses a CBD tincture or capsule, may also be inclined to\nconvert his or her beauty regimen to include CBD (e.g., CBD infused beauty products),\nand or use a topical for targeted relief as well. Our $16 bn estimate assumes the\nfollowing category contributions:\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

GW Pharma’s Epidiolex (highly potent, pure\nformulation of CBD) was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of seizures\nassociated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, and other companies\n(Tilray, MMJ Phytotech, Insys) have clinical trials underway in seizure disorders as well.\nAdditional possible indications for CBD products include autism spectrum disorders,\npsychiatric conditions, diabetic neuropathy pain, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and back\npain; clinical trials in these indications are underway.\nClinical trial results to date demonstrate few adverse effects from oral CBD doses of up\nto 1500 mg/day or up to 30mg IV. Specifically, CBD studies have not reported effects on\nblood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate, and no negative changes in mood or\npsychomotor slowing. Some studies (such as GW’s in Epidiolex) have shown side effects\nresulting from high doses of CBD (~2g/day) inhibiting hepatic drug metabolism,\nprompting increased blood levels of some background medications. Additionally, in vitro\nstudies have shown CBD to be pro-apoptotic in lymphocytes and to inhibit IL8 and IL10\nproduction, suggesting that it may suppress the immune system. However, though\nunknowns remain, the summation of pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that the\ncompound is safe at typical doses seen in over the counter products (5-10mg).\nAdditionally, other cannabinoids (found in CBD distillate) have been discovered that may\nhave differentiated pharmacological effects. For example, cannabidivarin (CBDV) may\nhave differentiated anticonvulsant effects, tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) may have\nanti-diabetic and appetite suppressant effects, cannabidiol-acid (CBDA) may have antinausea\neffects, and bannabigerol (CBG) may have anti-cancer effects. Further research\nis needed to elucidate the clinical effects of these compounds.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

The bill defines industrial hemp as a variety of cannabis with a\nTHC concentration of </=0.3% and allows farmers to grow and sell hemp under state\nregulation. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 41 states have\nset up cultivation and production programs to regulate the production of hemp. (CT, ID,\nSD, IA, OH, TX, LA, MS and GA do not currently allow hemp cultivation.)\nHemp is currently being grown under state Industrial Research Pilot Programs. Once\nUSDA rules are released, pilot programs may end in favor of USDA rules and rules of\nstate programs approved by the USDA.\nPrior to the 2018 Farm Bill, the 2014 Farm Bill allowed universities and state\ndepartments of agriculture to conduct hemp research under Agricultural Pilot Programs\nin an effort to evaluate industrial hemp as a commercial crop. The bill allowed states to\nbegin research on best methods for hemp cultivation.\nCultivation Practices Of Hemp Dependent On Intended Harvestable Component\nHemp is grown for fiber, grain/seed and floral materials with different varieties of hemp\nplanted for each component. Fibers are used in rope and textiles, grain is used in human\nfood (not legal for animal feed), pressed seed oil from grain is used like sunflower seed\noil, and oils, including CBD, are removed from floral materials for health supplements.\nCultivation practices differ for fiber, grain/seed and CBD in an effort to maximize the\nyield of the desired harvestable component. U.S. states have conducted pilot programs\nin recent years to help gain a better understanding of best practices.\nLimited Research Available On CBD Hemp Cultivation\nThere is little research on CBD hemp cultivation methods as hemp cultivation research\nhistorically has focused on fiber and grain/seed. This lack of research, combined with a\nnumber of variables that impact hemp for CBD yield, makes hemp for CBD cultivation\nmuch more art than science at this point. Cultivation methods have been described as all\nover the map. That being said, we detail methods from recent academic research studies\nand conversations with industry participants below. (The University of Kentucky and\nUniversity of Vermont have both conducted research in CBD hemp cultivation in recent\nyears but further research is needed for conclusions regarding proper production\ntechniques.)\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.\nHemp CBD Cultivation Steps:\n�\n�\n�\nObtain a license. Growers must obtain a grower license from their state\ndepartment of agriculture for the specific type of hemp they want to grow.\nFind a buyer/processor. Growers then need to find a buyer/processor for their\nharvest as crops can only be sold to licensed processors.\nSource seeds or clones. The grower must acquire seeds or transplants. Clones\n(rooted cutting of a plant) can be used instead of seeds. The key factor in\nselecting seeds or clones is understanding which strains produce flowers with\nhigh CBD concentrations while keeping THC at </=0.3% since CBD and THC are\npositively correlated which caps the CBD level. (A crop that exceeds 0.3% THC\nCOWEN.COM 11\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\nwill be destroyed.) Seeds that are certified (sold by domestic and international\nhemp seed distributors) contain </=0.3% THC or produce hemp with </= 0.3%\nTHC.\nCBD is more concentrated in female flowers (3%-6%) compared to male\nflowers making male seeds unwanted. Unfertilized female flowers have been\nfound to produce higher CBD levels than female flowers fertilized by male\nplants making male seeds unwanted in a production field. We note that seed\nmix (male and female) costs are significantly lower than feminized seed costs\n(incremental work is needed to increase the supply of feminized seeds).\nConversations with industry participants indicate that clones (first grown in a\ngreenhouse and then transplanted to the field) are becoming more common as\nthey provide a cheaper path to all female flowers in the field. Retail clones can\ncost $4-$7 each and can be produced for $3 each with access to a greenhouse.\nTest soil for contaminants. We note soil that has been used for corn production\nhas been cited as supportive for maximizing hemp yields.\nWater System Installation. A drip irrigation is most effective way to water\nhemp as it allows roots to breathe and conserves the most water.\nPesticides: Currently, pesticides are illegal for industrial hemp cultivation\nwhich makes plastic mulch an important step. So far, disease pests and insects\nhave not been found to significantly impact yields.\nFertilizer. Fertilizer requirements similar to wheat are considered adequate\nwith nitrogen the most critical.\nPlanting. Adequate soil moisture and temperature (>/=50°F), which influences\ntiming for planting, is recommended for successful germination. Industrial\nhemp can be planted in late April in Kentucky and late June in Vermont.\nPlanting depth for seeds should be ~0.50 inches.\nFemale seedlings, started in a greenhouse approximately 6 weeks prior to\nplanting, or transplanted female clones (planted with root structure), can be\nplanted into black plastic outdoors to control weeds. 5 ft x 5 ft plant spacing\nhas been found to be ideal and results in a population of 1,742 plants per acre.\nHarvest. Average time to harvest a 6 inch clone is 90-120 days, Flower buds\nfrom outdoor plants are removed by hand or using a debudder machine after\nusing a chainsaw or lopper to cut the plant down. Flower bud harvest is labor\nintensive and can take ~30 hours per acre. Flower buds in a UVM study were\ndried at 80°F for 18-36 hours until dry enough for storage without molding.\nIndoor storage requirements creates a production challenge. As with most\ncrops, variations in yield can result from variations in genetics (variety), soil,\nweather, and other growing conditions.\nTesting. State Departments of Agriculture conduct field and greenhouse\ninspections for THC levels, which is the only way to separate hemp from illegal\ncannabis. Crops that test >0.3% THC will be destroyed.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

The University of Kentucky (College\nof Agriculture) recently published six budget models for industrial hemp producers. Four\nof the six budgets address CBD hemp, with a separate budget for grain and another for\nfiber. We highlight the University of Kentucky’s CBD Plasticulture budget model below\nsince it is the most profitable and will likely be the most commonly implemented. We\nnote all four of the CBD hemp models indicate a positive return above variable costs per\nacre while hemp grain and hemp fiber do not reach breakeven due to low pricing for\nboth harvestable components..\nUniversity Of Kentucky’s Budget Assumptions For CBD Plasticulture:\n�\n�\n�\nDry matter yield per acre: UK estimates 1,200 lbs of dry matter yield produced\nper acre based on 1,500 plants per acre (recall 5 ft. 5ft. allows for up to 1,742\nplant per acre) and 0.8 lb of dry matter yield per plant (yield per plant can\nrange from 0.5 lb-1.5 lbs).\nGross return per acre: CBD concentration and price per % are the factors that\ndetermine the price of dry matter yield/lb. In the below example, 6% CBD% *\n$5.00 per % = $30/lb. Gross return per acre is then calculated by multiplying\ndry matter yield/lb by dry matter yield/acre (1,200).\nVariable cost per acre: 72% of variable cost per acre is for clone transplants for\n1,500 plants at $5.00 each. Other notable costs include planting, plastic to\nprotect against weeds, drip line for water, harvesting costs, cash rent and\napplication/test fees. We note clones currently can range from $3.50-$5.50\nper plant. Clones have become more common than seeds in Kentucky as they\noffer an easy way to produce female plants. A seed mix may be cheaper but\nwould include male seeds than can potentially pollinate female seeds and\nnegatively impact CBD concentration which influences pricing for dry matter\nyield. Feminized seeds are an option but will likely be the most expensive\noption. We note that the model assumes outdoor production rather than\ngreenhouse production since a greenhouse is efficient for clone production\n(then transplanted to the field) but prohibitive for plant production.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

For example, Marinol and Syndros, which the\nFDA cleared for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS patients,\ninclude the active ingredient dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol\n(THC) which is considered the psychoactive component of marijuana. In June 2018, the\nFDA approved an oral formulation of cannabidiol (CBD), Epidiolex, which GW\nPharmaceuticals PLC developed for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare\nand severe forms of epilepsy in children.\nIn addition to THC and CBD, more than 100 other phytocannabinoids have been\nidentified from the cannabis plant. This includes lesser-known compounds such as\ntetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabichromene (CBC).\nThe broad spectrum of phytocannabinoids can bind to a range of different receptors in\nthe human body and induce a wide variety of pharmacological responses. However, due\nto the limited research into these varying effects, a full understanding of the role of each\ncannabinoid compound is still poorly understood.

However, cannabinoids are only produced in limited quantities regardless of\nthe strain; in total, cannabinoids account for <1% of the dry weight of the cannabis\nplant.\nSelective breeding has led to strains of the cannabis plant that produce relatively large\namounts of the intermediary forms of THC and CBD. While THC content varies\nsubstantially among cannabis strains, it generally represents 15-35% of the cannabinoid\ncontent of the plant, and CBD is typically 1-12%. The relative abundance of these\ncompounds have allowed them to be well studied and their diversity of applications\nhave created a large commercial market.\nAfter THC and CBD, the remaining cannabinoids are found only in trace amounts in the\nplant. Compounds such as THCV, CBG, and CBC have elicited therapeutic interest, but\nbecause they are only present in minute amounts they have been difficult to extract and\npurify and impossible to produce at commercial scale. This has limited their study up to\nthis point.\nAlternative Methods For Producing Cannabinoids\nTo combat the limited availability of cannabinoids using cultivation-based methods,\nalternative approaches have been developed that use chemical and biotechnological\nsynthesis to produce cannabinoids.\nChemical Synthesis\nChemical synthesis methods use organic chemistry to produce cannabinoids; however,\nthe process has several drawbacks. Chemical methods have largely failed to be cost\neffective for commercial scale cannabinoid production because of the complexity\nrequired to produce the cannabinoid molecules, and extensive purification is needed to\nobtain a high quality product. Commercial chemical synthesis also generates large\namounts of organic waste, takes several weeks to produce kilogram quantities, and is\nexpensive. As such, practical methods for the chemical synthesis of many cannabinoid\nmolecules has not been developed.\nBiotechnological Synthesis (Synthetic Biology)\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.\nAn emerging alternative to traditional cultivation and chemical synthesis is the use of\nbiotechnology-based approaches to produce cannabinoids. These synthetic biology\napproaches produce cannabinoids through modifying the metabolism of genetically\nengineered organisms. This converts the organism into a biological factory, producing\nthe desired cannabinoid in large quantities.\nCompared to chemical methods, biosynthesis methods are more cost effective, scalable,\nand environmentally friendly.\nCompared to traditional methods, biosynthesis of cannabinoids is potentially more\nsustainable, more reliable, faster, and less expensive. Biosynthesis does not require as\nmuch water or energy input, is not subject to weather or other exogenous factors, takes\n~3-5 days to yield an end product vs. traditional methods taking up to 4 months, and is\ntheoretically less expensive. Additionally, growing cannabis often involves using several\nhard-to-remove impurities (e.g., pesticides), that could potentially create significant\nsafety issues and other undesirable dynamics.

According to one of our consultants who runs a cannabis testing\nlaboratory, separations instrumentation including liquid chromatography (LC) and gas\nchromatography (GC), and mass spectrometry (primarily single quadrupoles, triple\nquadrupoles, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers) are the primary\ntechnologies used in cannabis testing. We note that the cannabis testing opportunity is\nnot limited to LC, GC, and mass spec technologies – other technologies including genetic\nanalysis tools (DNA sequencers, microarrays, and PCR) could have a greater role in the\ncannabis industry in the future.\nCannabis Testing Details\nThere are three major categories of tests used to measure and monitor the quality of\nrecreational and medicinal cannabis products: potency testing, terpene profiling, and\ncontaminant testing. Contaminant testing typically includes testing for the following: (1)\npesticides; (2) residual solvents; (3) heavy metals; (4) moisture content; (5) mycotoxins;\nand (6) microorganisms.\nFor the most part, standards and regulations for cannabis potency and contaminants\ntesting are still in the infancy stage and vary widely by state – accordingly, testing of\ncannabis products vary greatly by locality. The aforementioned tests (also in Figure 13)\nare the most commonly performed tests. These tests are primarily performed using\nseparations instruments and mass spectrometry (see pages 22-23 for details on these\ninstruments and a list of vendors).

The solvent\ndelivery unit pumps the solvent through the LC system while the sample injector\nintroduces the sample into the solvent flow (known as the mobile phase). The\nchromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by\nthe detector, which measures the presence and amount of constituents. The data\nacquisition unit then records and stores the information from the detector. The\nunderlying principles of GC are similar to those of LC, with the key difference being that\nthe mobile phase is a gas instead of a liquid.\nLC Is Often Combined With Mass Spec\nTo obtain the mass spectrum of a single compound in a mixture, the individual\ncomponents must be separated prior to MS analysis. Separation is necessary for\nunambiguous identification because multiple compounds present simultaneously create\nan overlapping or mixed spectrum. The most common separation techniques used in\ncombination with MS are gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC). LC\nand MS from different vendors can be combined. LC is more commonly used as high\ntemperatures required for GC make it incompatible with the compounds under analysis -\nthis is a key reason why some cannabis testing labs prefer testing THC using liquid\nchromatography (to be clear, analysis using gas chromatography requires heating THC\nwhich changes its properties).\nChromatography Market Estimates\nFigure 15 Chromatography Market Shares\nOther, 36%\nShimadzu, 8%\nMerck KGaA/\nSigma Aldrich,\n10%\nAgilent, 17%\nWaters, 16%\nThermo Fisher,\n13%\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

In our 2019 global cannabis outlook\nreport (here), we had believed the CBD purchases in the U.S. likely skewed to the lowerend\nof that range. However, with new survey data from Cowen’s proprietary consumer\nsurvey, we can see that among our ~2,500 respondents (18+) in January 2019 nearly 7%\nreported using CBD as a supplement. Coupled with the diverse form factors reportedly\nbeing used (including close to 20% for beverages, which was surprising to us), we are\nnow inclined to size the current market at closer to $2 bn.\nIndeed, looking at Google search trends, we can see that interest looks to have climbed\nsteadily in 2016 and 2017, and accelerated meaningfully in 2018, which has continued\ninto 2019.\nFigure 17 CBD Interest Has Been Increasing\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nSource: Google Trends and Cowen and Company\nU.S. Google Trends: CBD\nEncouragingly, interest has been rising consistently among different form factors,\nranging from supplements like CBD gummies, to topicals and oils.

We believe the non-ingestible nature of the product\nmakes it more attractive to consumers looking to experiment in CBD and can provide a\nsource of trial into the category. While the CBD market clearly needs more clinical\nresearch into the benefits of the cannabinoid, it has been suggested that two of the\nprimary benefits are anti-inflammation and muscle recovery, which can cater to a large\nand diverse consumer base.\nOver the next two years, we expect the topical CBD market to grow to $1.5 bn (almost\n$1 bn less than our outlook for nutraceuticals). We estimate that in 2018, the total\naddressable U.S. topical market, which includes both OTC and rx offerings was ~$12.8\nbn. If we assume no growth in the category base, a $1.5 bn CBD category by 2020\nwould imply a ~12% share of the market, the largest market share among all of the\ncategories analyzed, excluding nutraceuticals.\nFigure 49 We Believe CBD Topicals Could Be A $1.5 BN Market in 2 Years\n$1,600\n$1,400\n$1,200\n$1,000\n$800\n$600\n$400\n$200\n$0\n$500\nSource: Cowen and Company\nU.S. CBD Topicals ($ in mm)\n$1,000\n$1,500\n2018 2019E 2020E\nOur below scenario analysis provides a wider incremental range of market share\noutcomes relative to other categories.

For beverages, in particular\nwater, this is evidenced by analyzing current Google Trends, where interest rose\nconsiderably over the course of 2018 and looks to still be achieving new highs, which is\nnot surprising, given the recent passage of the U.S. Farm Bill.\nFigure 60 Increasing Interest Reflected In Google Search Trends\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nU.S. Google Trends (CBD Water)\nSource: Google Trends and Cowen and Company\nOver the next 2 years we believe that the U.S. CBD water category can generate close to\n$600 mm in revenues. In Nielsen, U.S. bottled water generated just over $13 bn in 2018.\nAssuming Nielsen channels account for 50% coverage of the category implies total\nrevenues of over $26 bn. Applying the 4.2% CAGR the category has grown over the last\n3 years and extrapolating out results in total revenue surpassing $28 bn by 2020. Our\nestimates are premised on CBD water achieving a ~1.5% market share in 2019 and a\nconservative ~2% market share of the U.S. bottled water category in 2020. We would\nnote that a ~2% share of the bottled water category compares to a ~3% share for\ncoconut water. With the amount of consumer interest and potential functional benefits\nthat come along with CBD, we believe that a modest 2% share of the category is\nreasonable, in particular if multiple larger players within the beverage space enter the\ncategory and drive distribution.

This has been reflected in\nconsistent strong growth from MNST’s Ultra line, which offers functional benefits\nwithout the sugar, Muscle Monster, which is high in protein, as well as the emergence of\nBang, which contains BCAA. At their recent Analyst Day, MNST indicated that they will\nbe launching a new product called Reign, which will offer 5x the amount of BCAA as\nBang. As the lines between core energy drinks and health and wellness offerings\ncontinue to blur, we would expect all of the major players to come to market with\nofferings that contain CBD and provide incremental functional benefits (such as muscle\nrecovery).\nWe believe that by 2020 it is reasonable for CBD’s share of the energy category to reach\n~1%, which we view as conservative as it is below the current market share run rate that\nBang has already been able to achieve. A 1% share would imply revenues of ~$180 mm\nfor the CBD segment, assuming that the category continues to grow at the same 4.3%\nCAGR it has delivered over the past three years.

With core beer under pressure, a continued theme from the key manufacturers\nwithin the space has been a focus on innovation, as well as a move away from alcohol\ninto low and no-alcohol offerings (ABI is targeting 20% of portfolio to be low / no alcohol\nby 2025).\nOn the innovation front, hard seltzer looks to be resonating with consumers, which we\nbelieve is sticky, as it offers consumers a new product and opportunity to drive\nincremental drinking occasions, while checking the box from a health and wellness\nstandpoint. In 2018, the hard seltzer category achieved a 1% market share of the\ncombined beer category, which includes, core beer, cider and FMBs. If we assume that\nCBD-infused beer is able to capture a modest fifth of that amount of share by 2020 (~20\nbps), that could result in a revenue opportunity of over $130 mm.

Over the next two\nyears, we believe the category can generate over $350 mm in revenues, with upside if\nconsumer adoption of this particular form factor resembles the adult use market for\nTHC, or the growing popularity of nicotine vapor. We benchmark the market\nopportunity against the U.S. e-cigarette category, which we are forecasting to grow\n~32% in 2019 and ~27% in 2020, resulting in revenues surpassing $11 bn in 2020. In\naddition to e-commerce, we believe there will be distribution channel overlap with e-\ncigs, with a focus on vape shops and convenience stores (as opposed to just\ndispensaries). If vapor generates $360 mm in revenues in 2020, that would result in an\nimplied market share of 3.2%, roughly 10% of JUUL’s current U.S. market share.\nFigure 95 Vapor Will Be Smaller, But Can Grow To Almost $400 MM Figure 96 Our E-Cig Model Assumes Revenues Of ~$11 BN By 2020\n$400\n$350\n$300\n$250\n$200\n$150\n$100\n$50\n$0\n$40\nSource: Cowen and Company\nU.S. CBD Vape Sales ($ in mm)\n$160\n$360\n2018 2019E 2020E\n$12.0\n$10.0\n$8.0\n$6.0\n$4.0\n$2.0\n$0.0\n$3.6\nSource: Cowen and Company\nU.S. E-Cigarette Sales ($ in bn)\n$6.6\n$8.7\n$11.1\n2017 2018 2019E 2020E\nThe below scenario analysis shows that every 50 bps of market share capture is worth\n~$56 mm in revenues.

Infused MFG (91%\nownership) produces hemp-based CBD products and Spire Global Strategy (100%\nOwnership) is an advisory firm offering due diligence, security and intelligence services.\nThe company was an early competitor having launched its first CBD brand in June 2017.\nThe two main brands are Canna Hemp and Canna Fuze, which are distributed across 600\nretail locations across the U.S. (largely focused on dispensaries), with 15% of sales\ncoming from e-commerce. In 2018, 1933 delivered ~$12.6 mm in overall revenues, with\na gross margin of 49%. Infused MFG specifically contributed 34% to revenues (~$4.3\nmm), while achieving a gross margin of 71%.\nCanopy Growth (Outperform, C$82 PT). Canopy Growth is a leader in global cannabis,\nwith exposure to over a dozen countries spanning five continents. As the market share\nleader in the nascent adult use market in Canada, WEED generated sales of $83 mm in\nits most recent quarter. In addition, WEED was the first Canadian licensed producer to\npartner with a major consumer packaged goods company. In October 2017, they\nannounced the initial relationship with Constellation Brands, which was meaningfully\nexpanded with a $4 bn investment announced in August 2018. The company has\nannounced its intention to invest $100-$150 mm in New York State (where STZ is\nheadquartered), to construct a hemp industrial park focused on extraction and product\nmanufacturing. More recently, management has noted a willingness to invest as much\nas $500 mm against U.S. CBD with the expectation that this infrastructure could\nultimately be converted to capitalize on a U.S. adult use opportunity, when it\nmaterializes.\nCharlotte’s Web.

Going forward, Charlotte’s Web will continue to drive innovation and will look to\nimprove their liquid delivery system to enhance efficacy, convenience and frequency of\nuse. What is more, they will offer botanical blends to target consumer need states (sleep\nand cognitive function), upgrade bioavailability technology and focus on additional\nisolated cannabinoid products. To drive sustained growth, the company will look to build\nbrand awareness through media events and social platforms, among others and\nintroduce new, differentiated botanical products in the form of tinctures, capsules,\npowders, sports performance, topicals, cosmetics, beverages and pet products.\nCharlotte’s Web will selectively pursue M&A to complement their current strengths and\nwill also look to expand internationally, with a near term focus on the EU, South America\nand Asia.

With both ingestible and topical CBD products currently offered in select\nWegman’s stores, Curaleaf Hemp is focused on expanding into more channels and\nbecoming a national CBD brand by the end of the year. Curaleaf Hemp products are midtier\npriced, coming in above value offerings, but below what would be considered superpremium.\nThis allows them to competitively target pharmacy chains and grocery stores.\nCuraleaf believes women represent an outsized opportunity within CBD and will focus\ntheir efforts on positioning their products towards that specific cohort. This makes good\nsense to us as our proprietary survey indicated that women slightly over-index to CBD\nrelative to men.

We don’t find this surprising given\nthe high demand for and strong expected growth potential of CBD products, as well as\nthe differentiation it affords independents relative to larger chain pharmacies.\nIndependent pharmacies also likely find the high-margin profile of CBD oils attractive,\nwhich we suspect is similar to those of more traditional over-the-counter drugs. OTC\ndrugs are a substantial profit driver for independent pharmacies. The greater\nacceptance of and improving sentiment towards CBD products as a viable business for\nindependent pharmacies is evidenced by a panel held by the National Community\nPharmacists Association (NCPA) at its annual convention in October 2018, which served\nto educate independent pharmacy owners of the legality, clinical uses, potential risks\nand marketing tactics of CBD oils. For those independent pharmacies that have decided\nto sell CBD oils, ensuring that they provide high-quality products is paramount, with a\nfocus on looking at the bioavailability of CBD. Additionally, independent pharmacies\nemphasize the importance of patient education, in regards to treatment and potential\nside effects. Anecdotally, reports note that many independent pharmacies have received\npositive feedback from patients, attributing diminished opioid dependence and pain\nrelief to CBD oils.\nLarge Pharmacy Chains Don’t Appear As Quick To Offer CBD Oils\nLarge pharmacy chains, such as CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens, don’t currently sell CBD\noil. WBA management has noted that, while the company is monitoring the CBD market\nand the potential to sell it, WBA currently has no public stance on whether it plans to\nsell CBD products future. Interestingly, Boots, which is a pharmacy chain in the U.K.\nowned by WBA, sells CBD oil in three different doses (Figure 107).

That said, based on our\ndiscussions with a number of payors, if a state government were to provide\nreimbursement for CBD products under Medicaid, it would have to add CBD oils as a\ncovered benefit under the state plan, which may or may not require CMS approval. We\nnote that CMS and states do provide reimbursement for non-traditional treatments, if\nthey determine that there’s some benefit, such as issues around social determinants, As\nsuch, we see the potential for CBD oils to become a covered benefit under CMS, even\nwithout FDA approval.\nOn the commercial side of the market, payors we spoke with noted that CBD oils aren’t\neligible for coverage under commercial health plans because they’re not regulated by\nthe FDA. There are a couple of exceptions, such as GWPH’s Epidiolex, which is a\nprescription pharmaceutical formulation of highly purified, plant-derived cannabidiol for\nthe treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), or Dravet\nsyndrome in patients two years of age or older. Epidiolex is covered by commercial\ninsurance as it is an FDA approved drug. Payors noted three factors complicating\ncommercial coverage of CBD oils, including (1) legal issues, as CBD oils derived from THC\n(cannabis) aren’t legal if they contain equal to or more than 0.3% THC; (2) lack of\nregulation by the FDA; and (3) their availability as OTC medications.\nHealth Care: Provider Perspective (Rhyee)\nThe certified use of medical marijuana appears to be gaining acceptance by the provider\ncommunity, as evidenced by the recent distribution of a memo by the chief physician\nexecutive of Intermountain Healthcare, Utah’s largest health provider, to its network of\nproviders that the health system is lifting its prior directive that advised physicians not\nto write letters recommending cannabis treatments. However, it’s difficult to assess\nproviders’ stance on recommending the use of CBD oils. With greater clinical evidence\nsupporting the efficacy in treating various conditions, we may very well see doctors\nrecommend CBD oils as well, which some claim to be effective in treating loss of\nappetite in cancer patients, chronic pain, epilepsy, Huntington’s disease, sleep disorders,\nmultiple sclerosis symptoms, schizophrenia, and glaucoma.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

While we currently lack insight into when CBD products may become\navailable in Whole Foods stores, or what a regional or national rollout might look like,\nbelow we analyze Amazon’s physical footprint to highlight the potential for distribution.\nAmazon’s expanding physical footprint is made up of a small number of Go Stores,\nAmazon Fresh Grocery Pickup in Seattle, Amazon Branded Book Stores and most\nnotably its Whole Foods Market business. Whole Foods is a health focused supermarket\nchain based out of Austin TX that operates ~470 US locations and was purchased by\nAmazon in Aug ’17. Since acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon has deeply integrated it with\nthe company’s Prime offering. In combination with Amazon’s Prime Now platform,\nWhole Foods is now offering 2-hour delivery on thousands of in-store items in 63 cities,\nwhich account for over 50% of the US population and over 2/3rds of US GDP. Whole\nFoods also offers curbside pickup in over 20 markets.\nFigure 112 Amazon Prime Now & Same Day Delivery Top 50 US Metro Areas By 2017 GDP (%)\n2017 GDP\nRank\nU.S. Metropolitan Areas\n% of '17\nUS GDP\n% of '17 US\nPopulation\nAmazon Prime Now\nAvailable\nAmazon Prime Free Same-\nDay Delivery\nWFM Delivery via\nPrime Now\n1 New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA 9.8% 6.2% P P P\n2 Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA 5.9% 4.1% P P P\n3 Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI 3.9% 2.9% P P P\n4 Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX 3.1% 2.0% P P P\n5 Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV 3.0% 1.9% P P P\n6 San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA 2.9% 2.2% P P P\n7 Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX 2.8% 1.4% P P P\n8 Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD 2.5% 1.9% P P P\n9 Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH 2.5% 1.5% P P P\n10 Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA 2.2% 1.7% P P P\n11 Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA 2.0% 1.8% P P P\n12 Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL 2.0% 1.1% P P P\n13 San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA 1.6% 1.1% P P\n14 Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI 1.5% 1.3% P\n15 Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI 1.5% 0.6% P P P\n16 Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ 1.4% 1.0% P P P\n17 San Diego-Carlsbad, CA 1.3% 1.4% P P P\n18 Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO 1.2% 0.9% P P P\n19 Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD 1.1% 0.9% P P P\n20 Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC 1.0% 0.7% P P P\n21 Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA 1.0% 0.9% P P P\n22 St. Louis, MO-IL 0.9% 0.7% P\n23 Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA 0.9% 1.4% P\n24 Austin-Round Rock, TX 0.8% 0.7% P P P\n25 Pittsburgh, PA 0.8% 0.6% P\n26 Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL 0.8% 0.9% P P P\n27 Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, IN 0.8% 0.6% P P P\n28 Cleveland-Elyria, OH 0.8% 0.7% P P\n29 Cincinnati, OH-KY-IN 0.8% 0.6% P P P\n30 Columbus, OH 0.8% 0.6% P P P\n31 Nashville-Davidson--Murfreesboro--Franklin, TN 0.8% 0.7% P P P\n32 Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL 0.8% 0.6% P P P\n33 Kansas City, MO-KS 0.7% 0.7% P P\n34 San Antonio-New Braunfels, TX 0.7% 0.6% P P P\n35 Sacramento--Roseville--Arden-Arcade, CA 0.7% 0.7% P P P\n36 Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV 0.6% 0.6% P P P\n37 Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, WI 0.6% 0.5% P P P\n38 Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, CT 0.6% 0.3%\n39 Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC 0.5% 0.5% P P\n40 Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, CT 0.5% 0.4% P\n41 Salt Lake City, UT 0.5% 0.4% P P\n42 Raleigh, NC 0.5% 0.5% P P P\n43 Providence-Warwick, RI-MA 0.5% 0.4% P\n44 Richmond, VA 0.5% 0.4% P P P\n45 New Orleans-Metairie, LA 0.5% 0.4% P\n46 Jacksonville, FL 0.4% 0.4% P P\n47 Louisville/Jefferson County, KY-IN 0.4% 0.4% P P\n48 Oklahoma City, OK 0.4% 0.4% P P\n49 Memphis, TN-MS-AR 0.4% 0.4% P\n50 Urban Honolulu, HI 0.4% 0.4%\nTotal 72.6% 54.0% 34 40 46\nAmazon Prime Now Markets 62.3% 44.8%\nAmazon Same Day Delivery Markets 66.0% 48.6%\nWhole Foods Delivery via Prime Now Markets 69.2% 50.9%\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

Amazon offers private label goods across the gamut of product verticals,\nincluding consumables and vitamins.\nPer industry participants that have discussed AMZN’s private label business with us,\nAmazon’s approach is similar across most new product lines, most notably that the\ncompany is now focusing less on heavy discounting to take share from competition. By\ncontrast, we believe that while any foray into CBD could start with a big push by AMZN\nto gain share, if sales and reviews aren’t working, AMZN would likely reduce resources\nquickly. Additionally, Amazon Private Label tends to replicate top sellers for goods that\nare high replenishment, commodity-type products with undifferentiated branding, then\nadd secondary brands over time. Amazon private label has in some cases captured huge\nmarket share early (anywhere from 25-40% market share by SKU within the first six\nmonths).\nAMZN also tends to have the most success in verticals where branding is less important\n(a fact that could provide an advantage to more established CBD companies). The\nwidespread availability and acceptance by a retailer such as Amazon could also help to\ndrive mainstream adoption of CBD products and thus provide a benefit for the industry\nas a whole.\nOther Potential Platforms: EBAY Has The Reach To Make An Impact\nThere are other platforms that may be easier to break into than Amazon that would also\nprovide an avenue to reach a wide array of consumers. Ebay could be an alternative for\nCBD companies to tap into. EBAY has been losing share in eCommerce over the last\nseveral years, and developing a leading marketplace in a new product vertical such as\nCBD products could be an incentive to become an early adopter. Ebay currently has\n179MM active buyers on the platform worldwide, and the company generated over\n$90BN in GMV in 2018.\nOur survey indicates that unlike Amazon, EBAY has had less success in driving\nconsistent purchasing in areas like personal care and beauty as well as in vitamins and\nsupplements. Our data suggests that unlike Amazon, these two key verticals are\npurchased at about the same rate as any other category, which suggests that there is an\nopportunity for these verticals to grow meaningfully, in our view.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

We believe that growth could\ntake on a barbell dynamic, with early adopters being both high-end luxury players\nalongside lower-end local convenience shops, with middle-ground retailers including\nWMT, TGT, and COST likely being the last to sell CBD products after a test-and-learn\nphase is observed among the early adopters. We expect that CBD in beauty could be a\n~$1bn opportunity within skincare specifically; the skincare category currently\ncomprises ~23% of the overall $87bn beauty products market.\nLuxury Department Stores Are Early Adopters. A number of independent retail\noperators have recently announced plans to expand their physical presence to\nincorporate CBD. For example, luxury department store Barneys New York is adding a\n300-square-foot cannabis store-within-store concept called “The High End” to its\nflagship store in Beverly Hills, where it will sell CBD beauty products and vintage\nparaphernalia. Neiman Marcus also announced its “Trending Beauty” initiative, which\nincludes carrying leading CBD brands (5 SKUs) online and within 5 of its 44 stores.\nAnother example is Green Growth Brands (CSE: GGB, not covered) recently announcing a\ndeal with DSW Inc. (DSW, not covered) to sell its Seventh Sense brand within 96 USbased\nDSW stores; this announcement comes after a 10-week trial phase where 74.4%\nof product presented on shelves was reportedly sold. GGB also announced it will open\n108 stores within Simon Property malls (SPG, not covered), starting in March 2019.\nBeauty Could Be First Major Distribution Channel. Cowen believes that the future of\nbeauty will increasingly emphasize clean, natural ingredients within products – in line\nwith the broader health and wellness movement that is permeating into various other\nretail verticals. Therefore, we believe that beauty could be the first major distribution\nchannel to adopt CBD given the compound’s properties as a natural remedy to manage\npain, inflammation, and anxiety.\nSephora.com currently carries 3 SKUs with CBD dosages (Lord Jones and Josie Maran),\nand a variety of hemp-based products. Meanwhile, ULTA only has hemp-based offerings\nbut could adopt a comparable line to Sephora within its Prestige assortment. Average\nUnit Retail (AUR) for the three Sephora CBD SKUs is ~$70, or $1.85/mL, which supports\nour view that adopters will skew toward Prestige-cosmetics-oriented retailers such as\nspecialty beauty players (Sephora, ULTA) and department stores (JWN, M), before Mass\ncosmetics carriers like grocery stores, pharmacies or broadline retailers adopt it, as price\npoints are closer to $10/SKU.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.\nHistorically, broadline retailers, including WMT, TGT, and COST have shied away from\nentering controversial categories in their earlier innings, preferring to be last movers\nand not create controversies. We do note, TGT has previously made small inroads into\nCBD. According to AdAge, TGT briefly sold hemp and CBD oils in late 2017 before pulling\nall the products. Also, we note, WMT’s website does sell several hemp oil products.\nFigure 114 CBD Presence Is Limited In Mass Retail Outlets\nSource: Cowen and Company, company websites; Note: Search “CBD oil, CBD, Cannabis, Cannabis Oil”\nCOWEN.COM 69\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\nGrowing Application For Hemp And CBD Within The Apparel & Footwear\nMarket (Kernan)\nWith the changing tide on marijuana legalization and hemp cultivation, the use case for\nand interest in CBD applications are rapidly expanding. We think there lies within this\nfervor potential for greater utilization of hemp derived textiles in apparel, footwear and\naccessories after largely being relegated to specialist brands with a few exceptions. The\nWestern Producer, a Western Canada weekly agriculture publication, commented that\n“industrial hemp could reach whole crop utilization” in an article published on 1/10/19\n“Revenue Streams Expand For Hemp Growers.” We think this compliments the\nsustainability movement that is gaining ground in global apparel and footwear\nproduction and among Millennial and Gen Z consumers. Western Producer quotes Jan\nSlaski, senior researcher for InnoTech Alberta, that “textile applications have brought\n[about] the development of hemp-based uniforms, socks, underwear and other\napparel…” as its properties, which Patagonia describes as “linen-like,” provide a “quality\nsuitable for fine textiles.”\nApproximately $820MM worth of legal hemp products were sold in the U.S. in 2017 and\nroughly 13% of those hemp-based products are textiles according to Entrepreneur’s\n9/4/18 article, “The Hemp Business Is Booming.” The article’s author Rose Leadem cites\na history of the crop dating back “to the 1600s when growing hemp was encouraged for\nuse in sails, ropes and clothing.” This period was followed by years of back and forth\nregulation that alternately banned and unbanned hemp cultivation in the U.S. While the\n2014 U.S. Farm Bill allowed for heavily restricted industrial hemp cultivation, the more\nrecent 2018 U.S. Farm Bill, as described by the Brookings Instituted, offers a more\n“expansive” cultivation of hemp.\nFigure 115 Textiles Have Low Penetration Among Legal U.S. Hemp Products (2017)\nTextiles, 13%\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

We note that there are some\nglobal brands that offer hemp fiber, mostly but not all on a limited basis, in their clothing\nand footwear assortment. These brands include Patagonia, Columbia Sportswear’s\nprAna brand, Orvis, Thought Clothing, Toad&Co, Jungmaven, Eartheasy, Sanuk, Toms,\n70\nCOWEN.COM\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\nFigure 116 Patagonia Iron Forge Hemp\nCanvas Ranch Jacket (55% Hemp)\nAdidas and Nau. Nike offered a hemp-based SB Dunk Low sneaker in 2004, re-issuing\nthe shoe in 2016 around Earth Day. Patagonia, a $1B global brand that encompasses a\nfocus on the environment and social responsibility in its mission statement, views hemp\nas a “natural fiber that’s cultivated with low impact on the environment.” The brand’s\nassortment includes some hemp-based products made with 100% hemp, which it\nimports from China, or blended with other fibers like recycled polyester, organic cotton,\nand spandex.\nFigure 117 prAna Sharla Sweater (55% Hemp)\nFigure 118 Men’s (Hemp upper)\nSource: www.patagonia.com Source: www.prana.com Source: www.sanku.com\nThere is also a growing market for apparel and footwear that provide recovery\nattributes. For example, Under Armour has its Recovery line of apparel that includes\nCelliant which is designed to “capture body heat and convert it to infrared light that is\nreturned to your body, boosting localized blood flow and upping the amount of oxygen\nreaching your muscles.” Celliant is described as “utilizing a proprietary mineral matrix\nthat can be embedded into the core of a yarn or applied to a wide variety of fabrics.”\nThis demonstrates the ability to weave outside attributes into existing textiles to add\nbeneficial components beyond just providing an item of clothing. With CBD being\nreported as having health and wellness properties, such as to combat inflammation,\nthere could be potential for CBD to be infused into textiles. Canada’s Fashion magazine\nrecently highlighted Devan Chemicals in its 1/4/19 article, “CBD Is Everywhere. Will\nCBC-Infused Clothing Be Next?” Devan Chemicals is a Belgium-based company that has\n“added CBD to their textile solutions portfolio.” The company’s “R Vital” fabric reflects a\nweave of microcapsules of CBD that release when a person wears the clothing as\ndemonstrated in their website’s flow chart below. While still early stage, perhaps there\nwill be demand for widescale CBD infused textiles, although, as the article points out, it\nis unclear how the “potency” holds up over time and after washing.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

Tilray will have the ability to display its name on ABG cannabis\nproducts. Tilray will initially pay ABG $100MM and up to $250MM in cash in stock. In\nreturn ABG will pay TLRY 49% of revenues from any cannabis products with any ABG\nbrand name, with a minimum of $10MM/year for 10 years, essentially guaranteeing\nTLRY will receive a return on its initial $100MM investment. This type of deal opens the\ndoor for CBD products to partner with IP ownership to expand brands and CBD use\npartnerships.\nDSW And Green Growth Brands\nGreen Growth Brands’ CBD infused Seventh Sense products, including foot creams and\nmuscle balms, will be sold at 96 DSW stores nationwide out of DSW’s 500-store base.\nAs the sale of CBD wellness products become widely acceptable and stigma around once\nillegal products subsides, opportunity should increase to move into other nationwide\nretailers. Under our coverage universe, Dick’s Sporting Goods may have the potential to\noffer wellness products containing CBD. DKS has a total of 864 stores nationwide.

During an interview with CNBC last\nmonth, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson cited no plans to introduce CBD-based beverages\nin the near term, but did not dismiss the notion of ultimately piloting the ingredient.\nDespite early traction with craft/independent coffee shops, regulators in several states\nrecently banned CBD as an additive. The dynamics are fluid, likely delaying adoption\nfrom major coffee players like Starbucks in the near term. That said, we acknowledge a\nlonger-term opportunity if coffee shops are able to properly measure and disclose the\nCBD levels in their coffee, as bottled CBD beverages that disclose CBD oil levels in\npackaging are not restricted under the current ban.\nShould the regulation of CBD oil as an additive to food/beverage change or craft/\nindependent coffee shops find a way to comply with the existing regulation, we could\nenvision Starbucks ultimately piloting the ingredient. We believe Starbucks would need\nto better understand the science behind the ingredient, in addition to the standard\nevaluation of any new SKU around supply chain availability as well as meeting\nStarbucks’ high speed of service standards. Furthermore, given Starbucks’ heavy\nreliance on the drive-thru business at more than 50% of sales and 80%+ of ongoing\ndevelopment, SBUX would need to gain clarity around potential liability this entails\naround selling cannabis-infused beverages before introduction. We note in 2010,\nStarbucks launched an Evenings program that sold beer and wine inside of participating\nrestaurants.

The main CBD-related\nchanges in the law are that it: 1) declassifies industrial hemp as a Schedule I substance\nunder the Controlled Substances Act, 2) shifts regulatory authority over hemp from the\nDrug Enforcement Administration to the Department of Agriculture, and 3) provides\nautonomy for states to regulate the industry.\nHowever, the 2018 Farm bill does not change the FDA's oversight authority over CBD\nproducts intended for human consumption. The statutory language emphasizes that\n\"nothing in this subtitle shall affect or modify … the authority of the Commissioner of\nFood and Drugs … under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [FDCA] … to\npromulgate Federal regulations and guidelines that relate to the production of hemp.”\nFDA Implications\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a statement and FAQ immediately following\nthe signing of the 2018 Farm Bill, essentially reminding CBD manufacturers of FDA’s\ncontinued regulatory authority over CBD products.\nOn the positive side, Gottlieb indicated that the FDA is open to engaging with industry\nplayers early to clarify uncertainty and to help develop a clear and consistent pathway\nfor bringing legal CBD products to market. To that end, the FDA intends to hold a public\nmeeting “in the near future” to gather stakeholder input on CBD products, including the\nperspectives of consumers and manufacturers. The FDA will use this meeting to inform\nan “efficient regulatory framework for allowing product developers that meet the\nrequirements under [FDA] authorities to lawfully market these types of products.\"\nOn the other hand, Commissioner Gottlieb expressed concern over the proliferation of\nCBD products making drug claims. According to Gottlieb, \"the FDA requires a cannabis\nproduct (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic\nbenefit, or with any other disease claim, to be approved by the FDA for its intended use\nbefore it may be introduced into interstate commerce. This is the same standard to\nwhich we hold any product marketed as a drug for human or animal use. Cannabis and\ncannabis-derived products claiming in their marketing and promotional materials that\nthey’re intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of\ndiseases (such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, psychiatric disorders and diabetes) are\nconsidered new drugs or new animal drugs and must go through the FDA drug approval\nprocess for human or animal use before they are marketed in the U.S.\"\nEven before the passage of the Farm Bill, the FDA has kept a close watch on certain\nhealth claims being made by CBD manufacturers. A simple web search on the FDA's\nwebsite turns up dozens of previous warning letters to CBD manufacturers making such\nclaims (see below for links to FDA warning letters). According to Gottlieb, “the FDA will\ncontinue to evaluate and take action against products that are being unlawfully\nmarketed and create risks for consumers.”\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.\nIn his statement, Gottlieb also presented the following warning for CBD additives to\nfood and beverages:\n\"Additionally, it’s unlawful under the FD&C Act to introduce food containing added CBD\nor THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary\nCOWEN.COM 75\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\nsupplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. This is because\nboth CBD and THC are active ingredients in FDA-approved drugs and were the subject\nof substantial clinical investigations before they were marketed as foods or dietary\nsupplements. Under the FD&C Act, it’s illegal to introduce drug ingredients like these\ninto the food supply, or to market them as dietary supplements. This is a requirement\nthat we apply across the board to food products that contain substances that are active\ningredients in any drug.\"\nIn response to Gottlieb’s statement, Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.)\nsent a letter to the FDA on Jan. 15 urging the agency to update federal regulations\ngoverning the use and interstate sale of certain hemp-derived ingredients in food,\nbeverages or dietary supplements. The two senators, who authored the 2018 Farm Bill’s\nHemp Farming Act provision, indicated that it was “Congress’ intent to ensure that both\nU.S. producers and consumers have access to a full range of hemp-derived products,\nincluding hemp-derived cannabinoids.” They requested feedback from FDA within 30\ndays on the agency’s specific plans regarding implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill.\nSample Of FDA Warning Letters On CBD Products:\nhttps://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm616278.htm\nhttps://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2017/ucm583192.ht\nm\nhttps://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2017/ucm583197.ht\nm\nNotable State-Level Events\nCalifornia\nCalifornia has historically been more aligned with the FDA’s stance that industrial hempderived\nCBD cannot be used in food or dietary supplements. However, that state does\npermit the sale of food products with cannabis-derived CBD in licensed dispensaries.\nThe Food and Drug Branch of California Department of Public Health (CDPH) issued an\nupdated FAQ on CBD in food products in July 2018 indicating that its definition of “food”\ndoes not include cannabis products like edibles, which are legal in California. CDPH also\ntechnically bans the sale of CBD oil outside of licensed cannabis retailers, though it isn’t\nalways enforced.\nSeparately, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law in late September 2018\n(Assembly Bill 2914) that bans the addition of CBD or THC to any cocktail at a public\nestablishment. The new law “prohibit[s] an alcoholic beverage licensee from, at its\nlicensed premises, selling, offering, or providing cannabis or cannabis products, including\nan alcoholic beverage that contains cannabis or cannabis products, and would provide\nthat no alcoholic beverage shall be manufactured, sold, or offered for sale if it contains\ntetrahydrocannabinol or cannabinoids, regardless of source.”\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

Similar to California,\nthe Maine Department of Health and Human Services appears to be following the FDA’s\nlead in determining that CBD is an unapproved food additive.\nState health inspectors in Maine have reportedly told businesses to remove “all foods,\ntinctures and capsules” containing CBD from their shelves; however, business owners\ncan still sell “CBD products that can be smoked, vaped, worn as a patch or applied as a\nlotion, and all medical marijuana patients can still buy oral CBDs from licensed\ncaregivers or dispensaries.”\nNew York\nIn response to the 2018 Farm Bill, the New York State Department of Agriculture and\nMarkets issued a FAQ dated Dec. 18, 2018 on the manufacture and sale of hempderived\nCBD products. The department indicates that its current guidance is subject to\nchange and that it will likely be issuing additional regulations as the industry evolves.\nThe FAQ suggests that New York will allow the sale of CBD products sold as a topical or\ndietary supplement (pill or tincture), the latter of which runs counter to FDA’s current\nposition. However, the guidance appears to restrict CBD products for vaping/inhalation.\nAdditionally, New York will require licensure and prior written approval to produce and\nsell certain food and beverages under the New York State Industrial Hemp Research\nPilot Program. Licensees under the program can sell products that are “(1) listed in your\nResearch Plan and (2) produced in a facility meeting dietary-supplement GMP standards\nand (3) properly labeled and packaged for sale pursuant to FDA regulations for dietary\nsupplements, and (4) in compliance with all provisions of the Research Partner\nAgreement.”\nOtherwise, New York will restrict the manufacture and sale of ready-to-eat food and\nbeverage products with added CBD infusions or CBD extracts and lists products such as\n“CBD chocolate syrup, CBD soda, and CBD-infused frosting drizzled cookies.” In early\nFebruary, the New York Times reported that the New York Department of Health and\nMental Hygiene was beginning to more aggressively enforce this restriction in New York\nCity restaurants and eateries.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.\nNorth Carolina\nThe North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services recently\nannounced its intent to issue warning letters to manufacturers and retailers who sell\nproducts containing CBD oil in the state. According to a Feb 8 press release, North\nCarolina will follow current federal laws, meaning that “CBD cannot legally be added to\nany human food or animal feed that is for sale,” as CBD is the active ingredient in an\nFDA-approved therapy and cannot be considered a dietary supplement.\nNorth Carolina intends to take an “educate before regulate stance with industry,”\naccording to the release. However, the state will “reserve the right to be more assertive”\nto ensure consumer health and safety, likely meaning product embargoes and seizures.\nCOWEN.COM 77\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\nOhio\nState and local health officials in Ohio have also begun cracking down on retailers selling\nCBD products, according to a recent report from the Cincinnati Enquirer. The Ohio\nDepartment of Agriculture is reportedly ordering the “embargo” of products containing\nCBD, which has forced some businesses to remove products from store shelves.\nLike most states, Ohio has not yet set up regulations for hemp, which the 2018 Farm Bill\nrequires from each state before the manufacture and sale of certain hemp-derived\nproducts. In the meantime, CBD sales are technically limited to one of the Ohio’s 56\nlicensed dispensaries, under the state’s medical marijuana program.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

Resin and herbal\ncannabis are classified as Schedule IV, the most prohibitive category, including\ndangerous substances that have little to no medical benefits. THC is classified as a\nSchedule II substance in the 1971 Convention. CBD does not currently have its own\nscheduled class in the Conventions. Based on recent recommendations from the World\nHealth Organization (WHO), these classifications are likely to change in the short term.\nAlthough the cannabis plant, as a whole, is scheduled under the conventions, there is not\na distinct separation between marijuana and hemp at the moment. However, there is an\nexemption in the conventions for industrial uses of hemp, permitted there is no\npotential for abuse. The language in the treaties is vague and has allowed member\nstates to interpret the conventions in a way that permits the use of hemp to fit their\nnational legislation. This is a principle based on the practice of “good faith.”\nCannabis Recommendations (WHO)\nBeginning in November 2017, CBD was subject to its first pre-critical review conducted\nby the WHO at the 39th meeting of the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD).\nFollowing the critical review of CBD at the ECDD’s 40th meeting, it was recommended\nthat “pure CBD should not be scheduled in the International Drug Control Conventions.”\nFurther clarifications were recently added outlining that CBD preparations containing\nless than 0.2% THC should be removed from the drug conventions. The clarification does\nnot specifically mention the difference between CBD preparations derived from hemp or\nmarijuana. This outcome is based on expert consultations that found that CBD has no\npotential for abuse or dependence. CBD will be the first cannabinoid not controlled\nunder international law.\nThe WHO also recommended that THC be removed from the 1971 Convention and listed\nunder Schedule I. Similarly, it recommended that herbal cannabis and resin remain\nunder Schedule I and removed from Schedule IV of the 1961 Convention. Extracts and\ntinctures were also recommended to be removed from Schedule I. This marks a historic\ndecision because this was the first time cannabis has ever been subject to a critical\nreview conducted by the WHO.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.\nIn March 2019, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, comprised of 53 countries, will vote\non the WHO’s recommendations to schedule substances. A simple majority is required.\nHowever, it is uncertain whether the member states will vote on cannabis and its\nderivatives since the WHO delayed the announcement of the recommendation by two\nmonths. This may postpone the vote until 2020.\nWhen the vote is passed to remove pure CBD and CBD preparations, countries that\npermit the use of pure CBD and preparations of CBD will not be in violation of any\ninternational treaties. Although countries would no longer be obliged to enforce any\ncontrol on CBD, national jurisdictions may still implement measures to regulate or\nprohibit CBD use.\nCOWEN.COM 79\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\nEuropean Landscape\nEuropean Parliament Resolution\nIn February 2019, the European Parliament passed a significant resolution to create\nharmonized policies and standardized practices for medical cannabis products in the EU.\nThe Parliament stressed the importance of conducting clinical trials, which requires a\nformal assessment of socio-economic and regulatory barriers that have prohibited\naccess to research in the past. This is not a legislative, binding resolution; the European\nCommission will need to consider a regulatory framework that permits access and\navailability to cannabis medicine, therapies and scientific studies.\nThe European Parliament explicitly stated support for the WHO’s recommendations to\ninstitutionalize the medical and scientific uses of cannabis. Having these two\ninternational institutions aligned on standardizing medical cannabis policies will\nfacilitate support for interstate agreements and trade, and paves way for rapid\nlegislative change and growth.\nEU Standards And Regulations\nThere is not a supranational regulatory framework for cannabis in the EU. However,\ngeneral standards, such as Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), Good Agricultural and\nCollection Practice and Good Distribution Practice, are now significant for cannabis\ncompliance. Licenses and authorization must be obtained for certification. This is\nespecially required for pharmaceutical grade cannabis, which is why many Canadian LPs\ncan export to Europe and made investments to build GMP-certified facilities. Although\nnot necessary for non-prescribed cannabis, products with GMP-certification have\ntrusted quality recognition across the EU.\nIn the EU, the legal limit for THC content is less than 0.2%, in comparison to North\nAmerica where it is less than 0.3% THC. There are some disparities across the continent\nwith higher margins in Italy (up to 0.6%) and various import requirements country to\ncountry. Outside of the EU, Switzerland permits up to 1% THC content, which is treated\nas a tobacco substitute.\nEU Novel Food\nRecently, CBD has been added to the European Union’s (EU) Novel Food Catalogue.\nFoodstuff may be supplements, ingredients or other substance forms. A “novel” food is a\nproduct not previously consumed in the EU, to a significant degree, prior to May 15,\n1997, such as for example, foods that enter the market through new technology or\nagricultural products normally consumed and grown outside of the EU (e.g. chia seeds,\nvitamin K, UV treated food).\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.\nAmendments to the Catalogue occur frequently and provide a regulatory framework for\nEU Member States (MS) to follow. Some MS (i.e. UK, France, Germany, Italy, and\nHolland) requested to update the catalogue with CBD and hemp-derived products. The\nEuropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is now conducting a risk assessment for CBD.\nThis categorization includes pure CBD extracts and products that contain CBD extracts.\nThe EFSA’s assessment is limited to a daily intake of 130 milligrams. The outcome of the\nreview is expected in March 2019. By October 2019, the European Commission will\nrelease a draft act to authorize CBD in the updated Catalogue.\nWhile the EFSA assesses CBD, some countries have already banned the sale of CBD and\nremoved product from the shelves (e.g. France, Austria). MS may have their national\nfood or health agencies provide further guidance for CBD products and preparations.\nObtaining authorization for CBD and hemp-derived products (e.g. tinctures, edibles,\n80\nCOWEN.COM\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\nbeverages) will be imperative. This regulatory framework does not affect skincare,\ncosmetics or topicals with CBD or hemp ingredients.\nEurope\nUK\nThe UK legalized prescription based medical cannabis in November 2018. Medical\ncannabis treatments that are advertised with specific medical claims must obtain\nauthorization from the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Currently,\nlicensed medical cannabis products are Sativex, Dronabinol and Nabilone. Epidiolex,\nmedical grade pure CBD produced by British pharmaceutical company, GW\nPharmaceuticals, is undergoing the licensing process. “Unlicensed” products may be able\nto be obtained, such as products from Tilray or Bedrocan, under special circumstances\nwhich are unmet by other licensed products. Canopy and Aurora announced at the\nbeginning of 2019 that it plans to export to the UK later this year. Despite changes in\nlegality, the number of patients who have been prescribed medical cannabis treatments\nis quite limited.\nWhile pharmaceutical grade products are difficult to obtain, CBD products are widely\navailable across the UK. Pure CBD is not a controlled substance under the Misuse of\nDrugs Act 1971. Therefore, as long as CBD products are not authorized by the MHRA,\nmedical claims on labeling and packaging cannot be made. There are also no enforced\nregulations for testing or packaging. These loopholes in the legislation have led to an\nincreasing number of CBD products marketed as health supplements or wellness\nproducts. Due to the growing trend, CBD products have been widely available across the\nUK, primarily sold in boutique shops, cafes, health stores and online. Holland and\nBarrett, a health foods store, was the first High Street store to carry CBD products in\n2017. Other mainstream outlets now sell hemp-based beauty products, CBD tinctures,\nedibles, vapes, e-liquids and other forms of the substance. A handful of restaurants also\noffer CBD cocktails or hot drinks, and the number of kitchens and chefs using cannabisbased\nproducts is increasing across the country.\nHowever, in January 2019, the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) announced that it\nplans to conduct an investigation of CBD products for consumer safety. It is expected\nthat the FSA will later provide requirements for authorization. This may take up to 18\nmonths. Although enforcement is unclear at the moment, some CBD products have\nalready been removed from the shelves. Since the FSA’s assessment does not apply to\ncosmetics or skincare products with CBD, some CBD companies have expressed interest\nin launching beauty products now.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.\nA license is required in order to cultivate hemp in the UK. There are restrictions on\nwhere the farm can be located that must be approved by the Home Office. Many\ncompanies still struggle to secure banking and payment options for their hemp-related\nbusinesses. A lobbying group, the British Hemp Association, was formed to educate and\npush for legislative changes, such as whole plant processing and financial support. Due\nto barriers of entry, the number of hemp farmlands is small, around 810 hectares.\nItaly\nMedical cannabis has been legal in Italy since 2013, yet access and supply remained\nrestricted for years. In 2017, the Military Chemical and Pharmaceutical Plant (MCPP)\nreceived a license to cultivate medical cannabis, which supplemented the imported\nsupply from the Netherlands (i.e. from Bedrocan). The MCPP cultivates a medical\ncannabis product, FM2, that contains 5-8% THC and 7.5-12% CBD. A high THC product\n(FM1) and a CBD product (FM0) will soon be available. The MCPP only produces 100-150\nCOWEN.COM 81\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\nkg per year, which has led to a shortage of supply. In 2018, an import license was\ngranted to Canadian licensed producer (LP), Aurora, for 100 kg of medical cannabis per\nyear to help meet the demand.\nItaly has a rich history of hemp cultivation and it used to be one of the main producers in\nthe world prior to prohibition of the plant. The market opened up in 2016 when the\ngovernment announced that a license to cultivate hemp for industrial, food, cosmetic\nand energy purposes was no longer required. Whereas the rest of the EU requires THC\ncontent to be below 0.2%, Italy permits a margin of up to 0.6%.\nBased on the license exemption, many companies started producing and selling high\nCBD, low THC referred to as “cannabis light.” Cannabis light products must state that the\nproduct is not for human consumption; however, once a person purchases the product\nthe use is essentially up to their own discretion. These products are legally sold and\nbranded as “collectors’ items.” Since it is a “collectors’ item,” imported “cannabis light”\nproducts are not taxed. However, it is necessary to have proper test and analytics when\ncrossing the border to guarantee the product passes customs.\nOne of the first “cannabis light” companies, EasyJoint Project, launched in 2017 and is\nsold in hemp specialist shops. There are now around 1,000 e-commerce sites and other\nretail stores that sell CBD oil, capsules, CBD for pets, dried flower, vapes and cosmetics.\nLegally, the Health Ministry must approve products, yet this is not frequently enforced.\nForeign companies have invested in land over the last couple of years, including public\nCanadian companies Wayland, LGC Capital, Canopy and CROP. In 2018, Wayland\nentered a JV with CBD Italian Factory S.S. with plans to supply the local market with\nCBD for medical, therapeutic and veterinary purposes. LGC Capital entered an\nagreement with EasyJoint to acquire 47% of the company to gain access to the local\n“cannabis light” companies’ 415 retail outlets and 11 branded stores. In February 2019,\nCanopy made an investment in Italian organic hemp producer and CBD extractor,\nCanapar Corp. CROP, a Canadian holdings company, acquired 30% of Italian company,\nZhemplar, to cultivate and extract low THC, high CBD products, under a white label\nbrand, Tiffany CBD and Hempire Italia. The company also has exclusive rights with Yield\nGrowth Corp to over 55 wellness products that can be infused with CBD.\nSwitzerland\nSwitzerland is recognized for its progressive drug policies and evidence based\napproaches. Medical cannabis has been regulated since 2008 and continued to open\nwith regulatory changes in 2017. The number of patients is relatively small, at around\n3,000 people. Prior to June 2018, it was not possible to obtain pharmaceutical grade\npure CBD for medical purposes. That changed once the Food and Drug Administration in\nthe U.S. approved Epidiolex; subsequently, the Swiss law changed, too. Pharmacies can\nnow prepare magistral formulas for CBD for patients who meet certain conditions\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.\nAlthough cannabis is controlled under the Narcotics Act, CBD is not included in that\nlegislation. The country permits 1% THC to be cultivated, produced and used, which is\nregulated as a tobacco substitute. These products (e.g. pre-rolled joints, dried flower,\nand cannabis cigarettes) are regulated under the Tobacco Ordinance and can be\npurchased in supermarkets, specialty shops, kiosks and cafes. The first cannabis\ncigarette was available for purchase in 2017. These products are predominantly\nconsumed by affluent businesspeople during breaks at work or the end of the day.\nThe Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) provides regulatory oversight for tobacco\nand CBD products. Registration with the FOPH is required for tobacco substitutes to\n82\nCOWEN.COM\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\nguarantee quality control and compliance. However, this is practiced under “selfsupervision”\nrequiring the company to register products prior to market placement. In\nrecent years, the FOPH has been removing CBD products from storefronts due to lack of\nself-compliance, transparency and false claims.\nSwiss law also permits CBD to be used in pure or synthesized form for cosmetic\nproducts. The Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office regulates cosmetic products as\nwell as products that contain hemp-derived ingredients and CBD liquids for e-cigarettes.\nNone of these products can make any pharmacological claims. The Federal Office for\nAgriculture regulates hemp seeds, oil, fiber, etc, and seeds must be certified and listed\nunder the European Union’s Common Catalogue of Varieties.\nFrom 2017 to 2018 there was an influx in the number of cannabis companies in\nSwitzerland, leveling off from around 500 companies to around 100 companies. While\nmany are supplying the local market, a number of companies are exploring and\nexporting to neighboring markets (e.g. Italy, France, Germany). Beyond their\ngeographical advantage, Switzerland also is recognized for its quality and sophisticated\npharmaceutical sector.\nAt the end of 2018, LGC Capital entered a partnership with Viridi, a Swiss cultivator,\nprocessor and distributor of high-CBD products. Wayland acquired Haxon AG, a Swiss\nhemp producer of 1% THC products. Creso Pharma Limited entered into an agreement\nwith Hempmate Zurich AG for further expansion into the European CBD market.\nFrance\nMedical cannabis has been legal in France since 2013 and Marinol has been the only\nproduct prescribed. In 2018, the ANSM launched an investigation to explore scientific\ndata for therapeutic uses of the plants, type of eligible conditions and consider\nregulatory frameworks in other legal medical markets. An initial recommendation found\nthat legal medical cannabis should be authorized and final recommendations are\nexpected to be released by September 2019. Aurora has already announced plans to\nexpand into France by investing in infrastructure prior to the market opening.\nFrance is the leading hemp cultivator and processor in Europe, and the global leader in\nhemp seed production. In 2016, there was a total of 33,000 hectares growing hemp.\nStalks and seeds can be processed, yet buds cannot be legally processed, unless for\nmedical purposes. Synthetics are permitted for use. The country permits the cultivation\nof 20 strains, approved by the EU. There is one company, Hemp-it, that has received a\nlicense to grow different varieties.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.\nDespite its leading position in hemp production, the French government has cracked\ndown on the sale of hemp-derived products and CBD sold in stores, cafes and seed\nshops, as a response to public health and safety. Over the past few months, the Ministry\nof Social Affairs and Health and National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health\nproducts (ANSM) have been conducting a review on the uses and authorizations\nrequired for CBD. There are a number of CBD and hemp-derived skincare and cosmetic\ncompanies that sell lotions, cremes, pain balms, beard oils, etc. France’s extensive\nhistory in the cosmetics industry positions the country well for CBD skincare.\nCOWEN.COM 83\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\nLatin American Landscape\nChile\nMedical cannabis has been legal in Chile since 2017 following a pilot program conducting\nscientific research that began in 2014. A consortium of non-for-profit organizations,\nmost notably the Daya Foundation, ran this program. They treated over 1,000 patients\nin the first year of operations. Following the regulatory change in 2017, imported\nmedical cannabis products were available from pharmacies.\nProduct authorization and cultivation licenses are required to grow and distribute\nmedical cannabis products in country. The Agricultural and Livestock Service of Chile\ngoverns these licenses. Chile also permits home-grow, which is popular in the country\nand the region.\nDayacann (part of Daya Foundation) was the first company to receive a license to\ncultivate medical cannabis in Chile. Khiron Life Sciences entered an MOU with Dayacann\nin January 2019 to further expand into the Chilean market of around 1.8 million\npatients. In 2018, Tilray entered a partnership with Alef Biotechnology (now Tilray Latin\nAmerica) for distribution in Chile and Brazil, and recently received a license to cultivate\nand process medical cannabis products. Two Tilray products, T100 and TC100 were\napproved for prescription in 2016. Canopy Growth’s Spectrum Cannabis Chile is also\noperating in Santiago focused on medical research and patient outreach.\nHemp production has been part of Chile’s history, dating back to the 1500s, and has\nremained legal. There have been provisions in Chilean law to differentiate between\ncannabis and hemp. Despite its legality, there are not many hemp farms in the country.\nChile hosts Expoweed, a hemp trade show, that is Latin America’s biggest hemp event.\nWith the land and history, the country has positioned itself for growth as demand for\nhemp-based products increase.\nColombia\nColombia is becoming a Latin American hub for cannabis cultivation due to favorable\nclimate and cost of production. The country permits exports of extracts only, with the\nexception of small quantities of dried flower that are exported for scientific reasons.\nOnly permitting extracts for export is strategic to have traceability from seed to harvest\nand production. This is in order to curb organized crime and money laundering related to\nthe country’s history of drug trafficking. There have been trade agreements established\nbetween the EU and Canada in order to facilitate exportation of extracts.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

Colombia enjoys an\nadvantageous climate for cultivating cannabis at a low cost for production, which has\nattracted interest from many foreign companies.\nMexico\nMedical cannabis has been regulated in Mexico since 2017. This regulatory change\nfollowed a favorable Supreme Court ruling for a young girl who treated her Lennox-\nGastaut syndrome with CBD oil in 2015. It is permitted to have medical cannabis\nproducts with up to 1% THC content and these products are regulated by the Health\nMinistry. Aurora (through their subsidiary Farmacias Magistrales) recently received a\nlicense to import medical cannabis products containing over 1% THC. Pharamacielo\nrecently announced a JV with Mexican pharmaceutical company MINO Labs S.A. de C.V.\nto distribute medical cannabis domestically.\nMexico is the second largest hemp producer in Latin America. The law changed in 2017\nto permit the cultivation and processing of industrial hemp. In November 2018, the\ngovernment released a list of 38 OTC products – 21 food supplements, 9 cosmetics, 6\nedibles or beverages, 2 raw material – that have been approved for sale in the country.\nSeven companies received authorization for these products, which includes 2 American,\n4 Mexican and 1 Spanish company. These products must contain no more than 1% THC.\nProducts can be purchased through retail stores and e-commerce sites. The regulatory\nagency authorizing these products is the Mexican Federal Commission for Protection\nAgainst Sanitary Risks.\nMexico has announced plans to legalize cannabis for adult-use purposes in 2019, which\nwould significantly change the shape of the market opportunities. The country would\nbecome the third in the world to implement a nationwide policy to legalize cannabis for\nall purposes. In the proposed legislation there would include six types of cultivation\nlicenses – 1. Personal, 2. Scientific, 3. Therapeutic, 4. Recreational, 5. Pharmaceutical\nand 6.

GW’s Epidiolex\n(highly potent, pure CBD) was approved by the FDA in 2018, and several other\ncompanies are dedicating resources to conducting the pre-clinical and clinical research\nnecessary to follow in GW’s footsteps. These companies are developing cannabinoids\nthat differ by route of administration (oral capsule, oromucosal spray, sublingual pill,\naerosol, topical cream, etc), formulation (level of purification, bioavailability,\nconcentration), and dosing strategy (single agent or in combination). Below we\nsummarize the clinical trial data from GW’s Epidiolex in epilepsy and psychiatric\nindications, and Zynerba’s transdermal CBD gel ZYN002 in Fragile X syndrome.\nGW conducted a broad Phase III program for Epidiolex in epilepsy, consisting of two\nPhase III trials in Dravet, two Phase III trials in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a Phase\nIII trial in tuberous sclerosis complex, and a Phase II/III trial in infantile spasms. The first\nthree Phase III trials (one in Dravet and two in LGS) supported an NDA submission,\nleading to FDA approval in June 2018.\nThe Phase III efficacy portion of the first Dravet trial randomized 120 patients to either\nEpidiolex (20 mg/kg/day, n=61), or placebo (n=59). Epidiolex was added to background\nanti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). On average, patients were taking ~3 AEDS after previously\nhaving failed 4 or more. The average age of trial participants was 10 years and 30% of\npatients were less than 6 years of age. Patients entered the study with a median\nbaseline convulsive seizure frequency of 13/month. The primary endpoint was the %\nchange in monthly frequency of convulsive seizures during the 14-week treatment\nperiod compared with the 4-week baseline between Epidiolex and placebo.\nOn the trial's primary endpoint, Epidiolex achieved a highly statistically significant\nmedian reduction in monthly convulsive seizures of 39% compared with a reduction in\nplacebo patients of 13% (p=0.01). The difference between Epidiolex and placebo\nemerged during the first month of treatment and was maintained through the entirety\nof the treatment period. Nine pre-specified sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint\nconfirmed the robustness of the primary endpoint result. These analyses dealt with\nstatistical elements such as the data’s normality, assumptions about discontinuations,\nand the time period over which the data were analyzed. A number of secondary\nendpoints were also assessed (responder analysis, seizure types, global impression of\nchange).\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

This presentation disclosed that during the\nmaintenance period the reduction in seizure frequency was 41% for Epidiolex vs. 16%\nfor placebo, p=0.0052. The median reduction in total seizures was 29% for Epidiolex vs.\n9% for placebo during the treatment period, and 37% for Epidiolex vs. 10% for placebo\nduring the maintenance period. There was a clear separation between Epidiolex and\nplacebo in a continuous response analysis of convulsive seizures across all reductions in\nconvulsive seizure frequency. In particular 43% of Epidiolex patients vs. 27% of patients\ntaking placebo had at least a 50% reduction in convulsive seizures. 62% of Epidiolex\npatients vs. 35% of placebo patients were rated slightly improved, much improved, or\nvery much improved on the Caregiver Global Impression of Change (CGIC). It was noted\nthat three Epidiolex and no placebo patients achieved convulsive and total seizure\nfreedom during the treatment period.

The primary efficacy endpoint of the trials was a comparison\nbetween Epidiolex and placebo in the percentage change in the monthly frequency of\ndrop seizures during the 14 week treatment period (including 2 weeks of dose\nescalation) compared to the 4 week baseline period. Following the completion of the\nblinded portion of the trial, all patients were eligible to receive Epidiolex in an open label\nextension study.\nFigure 124 2nd LGS Phase 3 Trial Dose Ranging Design\nSource: GW Pharma\nThe first Phase III trial, patients were on an average of three AEDs, and had previously\ntried and failed an average of 6 other AEDs. Even on their baseline medications, the\npatients were experiencing a median baseline drop seizure frequency of 74 per month.\nThe average age of patients in the trial was 15 years, although 34% were 18 years or\nolder. On the primary endpoint, Epidiolex produced a median reduction in monthly drop\nseizures of 44% compared to a reduction of 22% in patients taking placebo (p=0.0135).\nEpidiolex reduced all seizures by 41% vs. a 14% reduction for placebo (p=0.0005), while\nthe reduction in all seizures during the maintenance period was 45% for Epidiolex vs.\n15% for placebo (p=0.0004). Similar to the Dravet trial, there was a clear separation\nbetween Epidiolex and placebo on percent reduction in drop seizure frequency across all\nmagnitudes of reduction. In particular, 44% of Epidiolex patients had at least a 50%\nreduction in drop seizures, compared to 24% of patients taking placebo (p=0.0043). 58%\nof Epidiolex patients compared to 34% of placebo patients were rated as \"slightly\nimproved\", \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" on the Subject/Caregiver Global\nImpression of Change.\nEpidiolex appeared to be well tolerated in the trial. 86% of patients on Epdiolex had an\nadverse event, compared to 69% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events\nwere diarrhea (19% of patients on Epidiolex vs. 8% of placebo patients), somnolence\n(15% vs. 9%), pyrexia (13% vs. 8%), decreased appetite (13% vs. 2%) and vomiting (11%\nvs. 17%). Again, there was no difference in the number of patients who experienced\nstatus epilepticus between Epidiolex (n=1) and placebo (n=1). There was one death in\nthe Epidiolex group from acute respiratory distress syndrome, but it was not considered\ntreatment related.

The median baseline drop seizure frequency was 85 per\nCOWEN.COM 89\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\nFigure 125 GWPCARE3: Reduction In Drop Seizures\nmonth and the average age of patients in the trial was 16 yrs, although 30% were 18 yrs\nor older. On the primary endpoint, 20 mg/kg Epidiolex produced a median reduction in\nmonthly drop seizures of 42% compared to a reduction of 17% in patients taking\nplacebo, p=0.0047. There was also a suggestion of a dose response in the data, with the\nlower 10 mg/kg/day dose of Epidiolex producing a median reduction in monthly drop\nseizures of 37%, p=0.0016. In both dose groups the difference between Epidiolex and\nplacebo emerged during the first month of treatment and was sustained during the\nentire treatment period. GW disclosed that the trial's secondary endpoints, and a series\nof sensitivity analyses, confirmed the robustness of the results. Similar to Epidiolex's\nother Phase III studies, although patients on clobazam (51%) had some additional\nbenefit, GW indicated that Epidiolex also showed efficacy in patients not on clobazam.\nFigure 126 GWPCARE3: Responder Analysis\nSource: GW Pharma, AAN 2017 Source: GW Pharma, AAN 2017\nAdditional data were presented at AAN 2017. Included in this presentation were several\nof the trial's secondary endpoints and a series of sensitivity analyses. All of these\nconfirmed the robustness of the results. For example, the proportion of patients with a\n>50% reduction in seizure frequency was 40% for 20 mg/kg Epidiolex (p<0.001), 36% for\n10 mg/kg Epidiolex (p<0.01), and 15% for placebo. The proportion of patients with a\n>75% reduction in seizure frequency was 25% for 20 mg/kg Epidiolex (p<0.01), 11% for\n10 mg/kg (p<0.05) Epidiolex, and 3% for placebo. The proportion of patients who\nachieved seizure freedom was 7% for 20 mg/kg Epidiolex, 4% for 10 mg/kg Epidiolex,\nand 1% for placebo.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

The most common AEs on 20\nmg/kg were somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, upper respiratory infection,\npyrexia, vomiting and nasopharyngitis. For 10mg/kg the most common AEs were\nsomnolence, decreased appetite, upper respiratory infection, diarrhea, and status\nepilepticus. None of the cases of status epilepticus on 10 mg/kg were deemed\ntreatment-related. Thirteen patients on 20 mg/kg Epidiolex had an SAE, of which five\nwere considered treatment related; and 13 patients on 10 mg/kg Epidiolex had an SAE,\nof which 2 were considered treatment related, compared to 8 patients on placebo.\nElevations in ALT/AST levels were observed in 11 patients in the 20mg/kg group and 2\npatients in the 10mg/kg group; 10 of the 13 patients were also on valproic acid. Five\nEpidiolex patients withdrew due to the elevations, but none of the patients met the\ncriteria for drug-induced liver injury. GW noted that overall 10 mg/kg seemed to be\nsomewhat better tolerated; 6 patients on 20 mg/kg Epidiolex and 1 patient on 10\nmg/kg Epidiolex discontinued treatment due to adverse events, compared with 1\npatient on placebo. There were no deaths in the trial. The results of the trial were\npublished in NEJM in May 2018.\nFollowing the release of Phase III datasets from 1 Dravet and 2 LGS trials, a key area of\ncontroversy among investors (though not physicians) had been the drug-drug\ninteraction between Epidiolex and clobazam, and in particular whether Epidiolex was\neffective in patients who were not also taking clobazam. This was put to rest at AES\n2017 when GW presented a pooled analysis of the two Phase III LGS trials evaluating\nEpidiolex’s efficacy with and without concomitant clobazam. Even without clobazam,\nEpidiolex produced solid placebo-adjusted response rates. Response was characterized\nin terms of “25% responders”, “50% responders”, and “75% responders”, meaning the\nproportion of patients who had a 25%, 50%, or 75% decrease in seizure frequency. For\npatients randomized to Epidiolex’s 20mg/kg dose, the placebo-adjusted 50% response\nrate was 22% for patients on Epidiolex without clobazam, compared to 33% for patients\non Epidiolex and clobazam. We believe that investors had been hoping for a 12-15%\nplacebo-adjusted 50% response rate for patients on Epidiolex without clobazam in order\nto be satisfied that Epidiolex was active without clobazam, and therefore the results\ncleared this bar. For patients randomized to 10 mg/kg Epidiolex, the placebo-adjusted\n50% response rate was 25% for patients on Epidiolex without clobazam, compared to\n27% for patients on Epidiolex with clobazam. The results for other thresholds of seizure\nfrequency reduction were also generally solid. For 25% responders, the placeboadjusted\nresponse rate was 9% for patients on 20 mg/kg Epidiolex without clobazam,\ncompared to 24% for patients on 20mg/kg Epidiolex with clobazam. At the 75%\nresponder threshold, the placebo adjusted response rate was 8% for patients on\n20mg/kg Epidiolex without clobazam, compared to 30% for patients on 20mg/kg\nEpidiolex with clobazam. In addition to the pooled Phase III data, there were also\nabstracts from the compassionate use experience of Massachusetts General Hospital\nand the University of Alabama Birmingham. The analyses from these two institutions\nalso concluded that Epidiolex does not need to be combined with clobazam to be\neffective.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

Results from an exploratory study of\nCBD (GWP42003) in schizophrenia were released in September 2015. The trial was a\nPhase IIa 6 week, placebo-controlled exploratory trial in 88 patients with schizophrenia\nrefractory to first line anti-psychotic medications. To be enrolled, patients must have\nbeen treated for a minimum of four weeks on a first line anti-psychotic medication and\nstill have a PANSS total score in excess of 60. CBD was administered as adjunct therapy\non a background of antipsychotic medication. The trial did not have a primary endpoint,\nbut rather a number of exploratory endpoints.\nCBD consistently demonstrated superiority to placebo, suggesting that CBD may have\nsubstantial anti-psychotic effects. CBD produced statistically significant benefits\ncompared to placebo on the PANSS positive sub-scale (p=0.018), the Clinical Global\nImpression of Severity (p=0.04) and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (p=0.02).\nThe proportion of responders (improvement in PANSS Total score > 20%) was higher on\nCBD than placebo (p=0.07), with an Odds Ratio of 2.65. Moreover, CBD trended superior\nto placebo (p=0.07) on sub-domains of the PANSS that were particularly relevant to\ncognition in people with schizophrenia. The Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms\nshowed a trend in favor of CBD, and reached statistical significance in patients taking\nCBD together with a leading first line anti-psychotic medication. The rest of the\nexploratory endpoints, many of which were other scales measuring functionality and\ncognition in schizophrenia patients, also trended in favor of CBD.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.\nEven in the context of schizophrenia, CBD produced a clean safety profile, with no\nserious adverse events and a balanced incidence of adverse events compared to\nplacebo. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (9.3% CBD vs. 4.4% placebo),\nnausea (7% CBD vs. 0% placebo), headache (7% CBD vs. 8.9% placebo) and somnolence\n(0% CBD vs. 6.7% placebo). There were two withdrawals from the study due to\ntreatment-related adverse events, one each for CBD and placebo.\nCBD's activity in schizophrenia is supported by pre-clinical data in animal models, as well\nas by a recent study published in The Journal of Clinical Investigations (2012) which\nsuggested CBD may be useful as either monotherapy or in combination with first line\nanti-psychotic agents. Nonetheless, while the p-values suggest that CBD has activity, its\npotency is difficult to judge without knowing the effect sizes. Therefore, additional data\nfrom this and subsequent studies will be necessary to fully understand the potential of\nCBD in schizophrenia. GW Pharma has indicated that it intends to pursue CBD's future\ndevelopment in pediatric orphan neuropsychiatric indications.\n92\nCOWEN.COM\nCOWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\nFigure 130 ZYN002 Produced Reductions In ADAMS At 12 Weeks…\nSource: Zynerba\nGW’s platform allows it to produce chemotypes with precise concentrations of various\ncannabinoids, and the company is testing numerous other cannabinoids.

Hemp\nstalk fiber was traditionally used as a textile for use in rope; clothing; and sails due to its\ntensile strength. Hemp seeds are used in foods and compressed to make oils that were\nused as a lighting fuel. The original diesel engine was designed to run on a variety of\nbiodiesel fuels, including vegetable oils and seed oils, which included hempseed oil. In\n1937, hemp production was banned due to its similarity to marijuana despite low THC\npresence, but to aid the war effort the federal government requested that farmers plant\nindustrial hemp to make up for a shortfall in imports from the Asian Pacific. Farmers\nplanted 36,000 acres of hemp in 1942 and set a target of 50,000 acres in order to\nproduce the 34,000 feet of hemp that was needed in each Naval battleship and for\nother textile uses. The cheap availability of petroleum based synthetic products and\nfederal regulations against hemp production caused hemp production to decline rapidly\nagain after the war in the U.S. and throughout most of Europe. As hemp now looks to\nmake a comeback in light of recent legislation, we see the use cases for industrial hemp\nto include many of the traditional textile and food uses that were previously common, in\naddition to the growing CBD market.\nFigure 134 - Industrial Hemp Imports In 2017 (Metric Tons)\nPressed Products\nApparel Fibre Board Ethanol Bread Supplements Animal Feed\nNetting Mulch Biofuels Granola Soap Proteins\nCanvas Printing Cereal Cosmetics Flour\nCardboard\nSolvents, lubricants, fuels\nTrue Hemp Yarn\n$2,739\nTrue Hemp Woven\nFabrics\n$1,819\nHemp Seed\nOilcake and Solids\n1,475\nTrue Hemp,\nraw/proc. not\nspun\n621\nTrue Hemp Yarn\n31\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

The process of\npelleting industrial hemp biomass would be a similar to that of pelleting wood waste,\nwhich gets converted into densified biomass products such as roundwood, pulpwood,\nsawmill residuals, and wood product manufacturing residues, which typically cost ~$30\nper ton. Wood biomass fuel has an annual capacity of 12.6 million tons per year and\nproduces ~675 GWh per year in energy. Access to local refineries is key to utilizing hemp\nbiomass as a cellulosic biofuel. Through local access to refineries, the fuel can be refined\nwhile transportation costs, which can make the products uncompetitive, are minimized.\nGiven the commoditized market for biodiesel however, where soybean oil has ~50% of\nthe market input by weight and corn oil has ~15% of the market input by weight, we do\nnot expect hemp to materialize as a meaningful player due to the competitive\nadvantage of high production crops competing for low cost production.\nCanola oil Corn oil Cottonseed oil Palm oil Soybean oil Other Vegetable\nPoultry Tallow White grease Other Animal Fats Yellow grease Other Recycled\nAlgae Other Alcohol Catalysts\nBiochemical CBD Production Methods\nCBD is most commonly produced by either CO2 or ethanol extraction from hemp plants.\nIn CO2 extraction, plants are filtered through a series of chambers with temperature\nand pressures applied to the plants that isolate the cannabinoids. The C02 method is\nable to isolate CBD at a 90% efficiency and is typically used when producing small\nquantities. Ethanol extraction introduces the hemp plant to solvent ethanol and enables\nhigher volumes production. In addition to hemp-based production of CBD, we believe\nthe opportunity exists for players within the biochemical space to produce CBD by\nutilizing a fermentation approach from other feedstocks. Amyris recently announced a\n$255 million cannabinoid development, licensing and commercialization agreement.\nAmyris plans to utilize the C5 molecule found in sugarcane in a fermentation process to\nproduce CBD. The company believes that the fermentation process ensures a level of\npurity that is not possible through traditional plant-based production, where CBD levels\ncan vary from plant to plant. In order to build out the industrial scale necessary for mass\nfood market, CBD products will need to be produced at standardized levels. Given\nAmyris plans to produce CBD at its Brotas plant in Brazil, which is fueled by biomass coproduct\nof the nearby sugarcane fields, we believe this will be an attractive option for\ncompanies looking to integrate CBD into their products sustainably assuming the\ncompany is able to produce cost competitively with hemp plants.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.

While\nover 50% of the population is in favor of legalization, only a few states have thus far\nlegalized cannabis for recreational use and the product remains illegal at the federal level.\nLooking forward, much work and change still needs to occur in order for this industry to\nrealize its full potential.\nRisks Pertaining to U.S. Cannabis-Related Companies: If you are considering investing in a\nU.S. company that is connected to the cannabis industry, be aware that cannabis-related\ncompanies may be at risk of federal and/or state criminal prosecution. The Department of\nTreasury has issued guidance that The Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) makes it illegal\nunder U.S. federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense cannabis and cannabis-related\nproducts. Many states impose and enforce similar prohibitions. Notwithstanding the federal\nban, however, many U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized certain cannabisrelated\nactivities.\nRisks Pertaining to Canadian Cannabis-Related Companies: In Canada, cannabis is an\nemerging industry and is subject to regulatory headwinds. While medical cannabis is legal\nin Canada, legislation has also been introduced to legalize adult-use sales on October 17,\n2018. An initial regulatory framework has been laid out for the adult-use market, looking\nahead, the category will be subject a number of potential headwinds, including taxes and\nrestrictions on from factors and packaging.\nThis report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com.
