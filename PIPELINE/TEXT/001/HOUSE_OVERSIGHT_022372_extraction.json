    "full_text": "﻿Election 2016: Trump Wins Presidency,\nRepublicans Hold Congress\nWashington Council Ernst & Young 9 November 2016\nAfter the most tumultuous and unpredictable campaign in modern history, Republican Donald Trump\nupset Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the Presidency, claiming at least 279 electoral votes (270\nelectoral votes to win) to Clinton’s 228, with results in Arizona, Michigan, and New Hampshire still\noutstanding, according to the Associated Press. The popular vote margin remains close, with Trump\ncurrently trailing by approximately 200,000 votes out of a total of almost 120 million votes that have\nbeen counted. Clinton’s blue wall of support was pierced by Trump with unexpected wins in\nPennsylvania and Wisconsin. He also won the needed battleground states of Florida, Ohio, and North\nCarolina. With fewer losses than expected, Republicans will retain their majorities in the House and\nSenate, thereby controlling both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\nClinton, who called Trump last night to concede the race, said this morning, “I offered to work with him\n[Trump] on behalf of our country” and “our nation is more deeply divided than we thought,” but went on\nto say, “we stand together…and our best days are still ahead of us.” In his remarks shortly before 3:00\nAM, President-elect Trump said, “It is time to bind the wounds of division. It is time for us to come\ntogether as one united America.” He went on to say that it was “not a campaign, but an incredible\nmovement.” And, alluding to his policy agenda, Trump said we “would be working together to begin the\ntask of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream.” Trump has touted an agenda of\nrevitalizing the economy and promoting job growth by reforming the tax code, rebuilding America’s\ninfrastructure, repealing and replacing “Obamacare,” and being “tough” on immigration and in\nrenegotiating international trade agreements.\nMaintaining the Senate majority will give Republicans the ability to set the agenda in the\nSenate. However, bipartisan cooperation still will be necessary to achieve meaningful policy\naccomplishments as Senate rules generally require a 60-vote threshold for movement on most\nissues. An early challenge may be filling the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Antonin\nScalia in early 2016 – one that could spark fireworks on Capitol Hill and across the country’s highly\ncharged political environment. How Republicans, Democrats, and Trump navigate through the process\nof nominating and confirming a new Justice to the Supreme Court is likely to set the tone in the Senate\nfor the next two years. The nature of Speaker Paul Ryan’s relationship with President-elect Trump and\nhis often unruly House Republican Conference is not clear at this time. However, the House Republican\n“Better Way” agenda, which was developed in consultation with the Trump campaign, is now a focal\npoint for congressional action.\nA\nO\nR\nC\nO\nM\nN\nK\nY\nElectoral votes\nTrump Clinton\n279 228\nLeaning Democratic\nLeaning Republican\n\nContents\nElection results\nSenate profile\nHouse profile\nAdministration and agenda\nLame-duck session 2016\nTax\nHealth\nEnergy\nFinancial services\nTrade\n2\n4\n6\n8\n11\n13\n17\n19\n21\n23\n1 | Election 2016\nElection results\nWith Republicans set to control the White House, Senate, and House\nof Representatives for the session of Congress beginning in January\n2017, the lame-duck session of the current Congress between now\nand the end of this year seems likely to be limited to keeping the\ngovernment funded beyond the expiration of the current continuing\nresolution on December 9, 2016. President-elect Trump and the\nRepublican Congress are certain to provide ambitious policy agendas\nwith plenty of proposals to analyze and the need for significant\nlegislative activity. However, it remains to be seen where Democrats\nand Republicans, particularly in the Senate, will be able to forge\ncompromise.\nWith 24 of the 34 Senate seats up for election on November 8th held\nby Republicans, and many of those seats quite vulnerable, retaining\ncontrol is a major victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch\nMcConnell (R-KY) and his Republican majority. Currently,\nRepublicans are expected to hold at least 51 seats in the new\ncongress, with Senator Kelly Ayotte’s (R-NH) reelection bid in New\nHampshire still undecided. In Louisiana, State Treasurer John\nKennedy (R) received 25 percent of the vote and Foster Campbell\n(D), a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, received\n17% in a crowded 24 candidate “jungle primary” to advance to a\nrunoff election to be held on December 10, 2016. Senior House\nWays and Means Committee member Charles Boustany (R-LA) fell\njust short in his quest to make the two-candidate runoff receiving\n15% of the vote. While the Louisiana seat is technically undecided,\nthe state went strongly Republican in the Presidential election and\nKennedy is heavily favored to hold the seat.\nIllinois Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) lost his race to Rep. Tammy\nDuckworth (D-IL). In Indiana, Rep. Todd Young (R-IN) won his race\nagainst former Democratic Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN) to succeed\nretiring Senator Dan Coats (R-IN). In Nevada, Catherine Cortez Masto\n(D-NV) beat Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) to hold the seat of retiring Senate\nDemocratic Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). In other notable races:\n► Ohio: Once ground zero for Senate control, Senator Rob Portman\n(R-OH) easily beat former Governor Ted Strickland (D-OH).\n► North Carolina: In a race that was consistently within the margin\nof error in recent days, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) held onto his\nseat against former state legislator Deborah Ross (D-NC).\n► Pennsylvania: Behind in most recent polling, Senator Pat Toomey\n(R-PA) prevailed against former federal and state environmental\nofficial Katie McGinty (D-PA).\nSelect Senate race results\nArizona\nKirkpatrick\nMcCain\nColorado\nBennet\nGlenn\nFlorida\nMurphy\nRubio\nIllinois\nDuckworth\nKirk\nIndiana\nBayh\nYoung\nMissouri\nKander\nBlunt\nNevada\nCortez Masto\nHeck\nNew Hampshire\nHassan\nAyotte ?\nNorth Carolina\nRoss\nBurr\nOhio\nStrickland\nPortman\nPennsylvania\nMcGinty\nToomey\nWisconsin\nFeingold\nJohnson\n2 | Election 2016\nElection results\nAlong with the House GOP majority, Senate Republicans will unambiguously set the agenda in the new Congress. However,\nwith a closely divided Senate, Republicans will be well short of the 60 votes necessary under the Senate rules to bring\ndebate to a close (cloture) and advance controversial legislation without votes from the other party. Narrow Republican\nand Democratic majorities in the recent past have both found their legislative agendas stalled unless they were willing to\ncompromise to attract bipartisan support.\nOne area where 60 votes are not required is confirming appointments to the Administration and the Federal courts, with\nthe exception of the Supreme Court. There could be speculation about whether Senate Republicans would consider a rules\nchange to create a 51 vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees, also known as the “nuclear option.” But any serious\nconsideration on this front is far from certain.\nRepublican House losses in the election were minimized for a number of reasons, including the Republican turnout for\nDonald Trump, the relatively static map created by the post-2010 redistricting process, and highly localized campaigns\nrun by Republican House Members in marginal districts where support for Trump was weaker. With a loss in the single\ndigits, the GOP majority goes from 246 members to somewhere in the 230s, giving Republicans a margin of 20 or so seats\nversus the current 30.\n3 | Election 2016\nSenate profile\nCurrent Majority Leader McConnell will stay in the post after successfully working this past session to keep the Senate in\nRepublican hands, while Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) will take over for retiring Senator Reid after 12 years as\nDemocratic Leader. Given that Republicans held control of the Senate, McConnell will spend the next two years working\ntoward a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority in the 2018 elections, when 25 Democratic or Independent seats are up for reelection,\ncompared with only eight Republicans. Schumer will likely try to reach some compromises with Republicans while\ndistinguishing his party ahead of 2018, and will likely be pulled left, with the influence of Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-\nMA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT).\nLeadership elections are expected to be held on Wednesday, November 16, and committee ratios, likely to be close to\nwhat they are now, will be determined soon after the Senate reconvenes. Predicting the chair and ranking members of\nSenate committees immediately after an election is speculative because members with seniority will be able to choose\nbetween chairmanships and must adhere to Senate Republican committee leadership term limits. Republican senators may\nserve as chairman for six years and six years as ranking member for any one committee, on a cumulative basis. Following\nis a discussion of expected select committee chairmen and membership for 2017. An added complication could arise\nshould sitting Republican senators be tapped for cabinet positions in the Trump administration.\nAGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY (Same leadership as 114 th Congress)\nChairman Pat Roberts (R-KS)\nRanking Member Debbie Stabenow (D-MI)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nChairman Thad Cochran (R-MS) Ranking Member ?????\nSeveral Democrats on the committee with significant seniority are in line to choose other ranking positions: Leahy -\nJudiciary; Murray - HELP; Feinstein - Intelligence; Durbin, who serves as the Assistant Democratic Leader, and doesn’t\ntake a ranking member position on a major committee; and Jack Reed - Armed Services. However, given the importance\nof the Appropriations Committee and its responsibility for preparing bills to fund the government, it would be surprising\nthat the ranking position would be very far down that list.\nARMED SERVICES (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman John McCain (R-AZ)\nRanking Member Jack Reed (D-RI)\nBANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT\nChairman Mike Crapo (R-ID)\nRanking Member Sherrod Brown (D-OH)\nSenator Richard Shelby (R-AL) has served his six-year limit as Chairman.\nBUDGET\nChairman Mike Enzi (R-WY)\nRanking Member Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\nIf Senator Murray retains the ranking slot on HELP, former presidential candidate Sanders will continue to fill the ranking\nmember role.\nCOMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman John Thune (R-SD)\nRanking Member Bill Nelson (D-FL)\n4 | Election 2016\nSenate profile\nENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman Lisa Murkowski (R-AK)\nRanking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA)\nENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman John Barrasso (R-WY)\nRanking Member Tom Carper (D-DE)\nJim Inhofe (R-OK) has exhausted his six-year limit. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), the current ranking member of EPW, is\nretiring. Senator Carper could opt for the post over his current position on the Homeland Security and Governmental\nAffairs Committee. If Carper decides to stay at HSGA, Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) would have the option of ranking\nmember of EPW or Foreign Relations. If Cardin should choose Foreign Relations, Senator Sanders would be next in line for\nthe ranking member position. Barrasso can be expected to continue the criticisms of current Chairman Inhofe of EPA\nregulations and their effect on US energy development and the energy industry.\nFINANCE (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT)\nRanking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR)\nSenator Hatch will continue to serve as Chairman by way of an agreement reached with Senator Grassley, who is actually\nmore senior to Senator Hatch on the Committee. (Grassley will serve as Judiciary Chairman.) Dan Coats (R-IN) is retiring\nfrom Congress. Senators Richard Burr (R-NC) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) both won re-election races. Eight Democratic\ncommittee members will be running for re-election in 2018: Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Bill Nelson\n(D-FL), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Bob Casey (D-PA).\nFOREIGN RELATIONS (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman Bob Corker (R-TN)\nRanking Member Ben Cardin (D-MD)\nHEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\nChairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN)\nRanking Member Patty Murray (D-WA)\nIf Senator Murray opts for ranking member of Appropriations, Senator Sanders would be in line to be ranking member of\nHELP where he could be expected to use the position to highlight income inequality.\nHOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\nChairman Ron Johnson (R-WI)\nRanking Member Claire McCaskill (D-MO)\nSenator McCaskill will get the ranking member position if Senator Tom Carper (D-DE) opts for ranking member of EPW.\nJUDICIARY\nChairman Charles Grassley (R-IA)\nRanking Member Patrick Leahy (D-VT)\nSenator Leahy will have the option of choosing ranking member of either Appropriations or Judiciary. Most think that with\nthe expectation of at least one Supreme Court nomination and immigration reform legislation in the next two years, he will\nopt to stay in the ranking position on Judiciary.\n5 | Election 2016\nHouse profile\nBy retaining control of the House and Senate, with the loss of only a few seats, and winning the White House, Republicans\nbelieve they have a mandate to govern. The potential for a Freedom Caucus challenge to Paul Ryan’s leadership is unlikely\ngiven the party’s strong showing. The path is clear for the Speaker to pursue the policy actions described in the “Better\nWay” policy platform developed earlier this year and promoted through the ubiquitous presence of a pamphlet describing\nthe plan that he used during the campaign and press appearances. That effort generated interest from Trump, who\nadapted his tax plan to reflect some of the proposals.\nThe week following the elections and prior to Thanksgiving will be focused on internal party organizational issues,\nincluding the election of party leadership, and discussion around Republican conference and Democratic caucus rules and\nthe makeup of the Steering Committee, which will determine committee assignments. The leadership of the chamber will\nbe decided in closed-door meetings during this time, with a formal floor vote for Speaker in January. Some Steering\nCommittee decisions regarding committees are likely to take place after Thanksgiving and to include ratification of\ncommittee chairmanships and Speaker-appointed committee memberships, as well as appointments of members to vacant\nslots on “A” committees (including Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and Financial Services). Ryan and Democratic\nLeader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will conduct a negotiation to determine committee ratios, which would be expected to be close\nto what they are now.\nWAYS AND MEANS (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman Kevin Brady (R-TX)\nRanking Member Sander Levin (D-MI)\nRepublican members Boustany and Young ran for Senate ,and Rep. Robert Dold (R-IL) lost his re-election campaign,\nleaving three open seats. Republicans under consideration for Committee seats include Reps. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL), Mike\nBishop (R-MI), Bradley Byrne (R-AL), Jackie Walorski (R-IN) and Andy Barr (R-KY). Longtime Democratic members Charles\nRangel (D-NY) and Jim McDermott (D-WA) are retiring.\nENERGY & COMMERCE\nChair John Shimkus (R-IL)/Greg Walden (R-OR)\nRanking Member Frank Pallone (D-NJ)\nRep. Fred Upton (R-MI) will reach his term limit as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and will step down at\nthe end of the current Congress. Rep. Upton noted that he’s “not planning to” seek a waiver of the term limits. The two\ncurrent frontrunners to replace the outgoing chairman include Reps. John Shimkus (R-IL) and Greg Walden (R-OR). Rep.\nShimkus has seniority on the committee, but Walden has also generated party support related to his role serving as\nchairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee for the past two election cycles. Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) is\nalso expected to run for the Chairmanship. The powerful Republican Steering Committee, consisting of Republican\nleadership as well as rank-and-file members, will decide in a private meeting who will lead the committee in the 115 th\nCongress. Adding to the leadership shuffle at the Energy and Commerce Committee, the current chairman of the E&C\nSubcommittee on Health, Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA), is retiring at the end of the Congress. Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA) is under\nconsideration to replace him.\nEDUCATION & THE WORKFORCE\nChairman Virginia Foxx (R-NC)\nRanking Member Bobby Scott (D-VA)\nCurrent Chairman John Kline (R-MN) did not seek reelection. He will likely be succeeded as chair of the House Education\nand Workforce Committee by Rep. Foxx. She has had a limited role on pension and retirement issues, but has been a\nreliable voice for limited government regulation and joined in opposing the Obama Administration’s investment advice\nregulations. Where Chairman Kline put pension reform high on the committee’s agenda, Foxx has not signaled a strong\ninterest in making pension issues a priority.\n6\n| Election 2016\nHouse profile\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nChairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R–NJ)\nRanking Member Nita Lowey (D-NY)\nBUDGET\nChairman Tom Price (R-GA)\nRanking Member John Yarmuth (D-KY)\nCurrent ranking Member Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) was elected to the Senate; Yarmuth is expected to replace him.\nFINANCIAL SERVICES (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman Jeb Hensarling (R-TX)\nRanking Member Maxine Waters (D-CA)\nJUDICIARY (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA)\nRanking Member John Conyers (D-MI)\nOVERSIGHT (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT)\nRanking Member Elijah Cummings (D-MD)\nTRANSPORTATION (Same leadership as 114th Congress)\nChairman Bill Shuster (R-PA)\nRanking Member Peter DeFazio (D-OR)\n7 | Election 2016\nAdministration and\nagenda\nLooking ahead to the Trump administration and a\nRepublican-controlled Congress, the focus will be on\nTrump’s top priorities: infrastructure, tax reform,\ndismantling the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and\nimmigration reform. President-elect Trump highlighted\nhis commitment to infrastructure investment during his\nvictory speech early November 9. “We are going to fix our\ninner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels,\nairports, schools, hospitals,” he said. “We’re going to\nrebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way,\nsecond to none. And we will put millions of our people to\nwork as we rebuild it.” Trump would fund infrastructure\ninvestment through public-private partnerships and\nprivate investments through tax incentives rather than\ntax reform, though he has called for early action on that\nissue as well. On October 22, Trump outlined a voter\ncontract for his first 100 days plan that calls for\nenactment of:\n► The Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act\n(comprehensive tax reform);\n► The End the Offshoring Act, to establish tariffs to\ndiscourage companies from laying off their workers in\norder to relocate in other countries and ship their\nproducts back to the U.S. tax-free;\n► The American Energy & Infrastructure Act, to leverage\npublic-private partnerships and private investments\nthrough tax incentives to raise $1 trillion in\ninfrastructure investment over 10 years;\n► The School Choice And Education Opportunity Act, to\nexpand primary education options and make college\nmore affordable;\n► The Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act, to repeal the\nACA and replace it with Health Savings Accounts;\n► The Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act, to allow\nAmericans to deduct childcare and elder care;\n► The End Illegal Immigration Act, to fund the\nconstruction of a wall on the Mexican border;\n► The Restoring Community Safety Act, to reduce crime;\n► The Restoring National Security Act, to rebuild the\nmilitary by eliminating the defense sequester and\nexpanding military investment; and\n► The Clean up Corruption in Washington Act, to enact\n“new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce\nthe corrupting influence of special interests on our\npolitics.”\nAs part of the voter contract announced in October,\nTrump has also pledged to act on his first day in office to\n“cancel every unconstitutional executive action,\nmemorandum and order issued by President Obama.”\nTrump advisor Anthony Scaramucci said in October that\nthe new administration would repeal the rulemaking on\nconflicts of interest in the delivery of investment advice to\nIRA and 401(k) plan investors.\nRegulations that have been finalized cannot be\nunilaterally vacated by executive order without\nintervening regulatory or legislative action. In order to\nmake changes to final regulations without legislative\naction, agencies are typically required to follow the\nadministrative procedural process which requires a notice\nand comment process prior to modifying regulations. If\nan Administration wishes to repeal or revise a final\nregulation through the administrative process, the agency\nmay be required to demonstrate that its actions are not\n“arbitrary and capricious,” and based on more than a\nchange in political views. It is possible that a new\nAdministration could dispense with the notice and\ncomment process by moving to issue an interim final rule,\nreplacing the previous regulation. In this situation, the\nagency could be called on demonstrate that it acted with\n“good cause” to circumvent the typical notice and\ncomment requirements.\nA new Administration could also use its executive power\nto affect the level of legal defense of challenges to\nexisting regulations provided by the Administration or\ntemporarily refuse to exercise its enforcement\nresponsibilities until compelled through legal action or\npublic pressure.\nTrump also intends to immediately begin the process of\nfilling the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of\nAntonin Scalia in early 2016 – one that could spark\nfireworks on Capitol Hill and across the country’s highly\ncharged political environment. How Republicans,\nDemocrats, and Trump navigate through the process of\nnominating and confirming a Justice to the Supreme\nCourt is likely to set the tone in the Senate for the next\ntwo years.\nTrump also intends to act on trade issues on his first day\nin office, including:\n► announcing his intention to renegotiate or withdraw\nfrom NAFTA;\n► ·announcing withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific\nPartnership; and\n8\n| Election 2016\nAdministration and\nagenda\n► directing Treasury to label China a currency\nmanipulator.\nConsistent with Trump’s desire to change the way\nbusiness is conducted in Washington, he also pledges to\nact on his first day in office to:\n► propose a constitutional amendment to impose term\nlimits on all members of Congress;\n► require that for every new federal regulation, two\nexisting regulations must be eliminated; and\n► impose a five–year ban on White House and\ncongressional officials becoming lobbyists after they\nleave government service.\n(The Trump Contract with the Voter is available at\nhttps://assets.donaldjtrump.com/CONTRACT_FOR_THE_\nVOTER.pdf)\nBudget. While President-elect Trump has vowed to act\nquickly on repeal of the ACA, it is difficult to see how that\ncan be accomplished outside of reconciliation instructions\nfor FY 2018. “When we win on November 8th, and elect a\nRepublican Congress, we will be able to immediately\nrepeal and replace Obamacare. I will ask Congress to\nconvene a special session,” he said November 1.\nAn early focus of attention will be the first Trump budget\nproposal and the congressional FY 2018 budget\nresolution. As with the past several years under divided\ngovernment, a main issue will be how to address the\nBudget Control Act sequester for FY 2018. According to\nthe Congressional Budget Office, the cap on discretionary\nbudget authority originally established by the Budget\nControl Act is set at $1.156 billion in 2018, though it will\nbe reduced by automatic procedures unless Congress\nintervenes. CBO said the reduction will total $91 billion\nfor 2018: $54 billion for defense and $37 billion in 2018\nfor nondefense. Therefore, total budget authority is\nslated to be $1.065 trillion, split between $549 billion for\ndefense and $516 billion for nondefense. Both Trump and\nSpeaker Ryan want to eliminate the sequester as it\napplies to defense, but would likely want to maintain the\nsequester for non-defense spending.\nAs reported in Politico last month, Speaker Ryan is bullish\non using the “budget reconciliation” process to pass\nsignificant tax reform. “This is our plan for 2017,” Ryan\nsaid, waving a copy of his “Better Way” policy agenda.\n“Much of this you can do through budget reconciliation.”\nHe said key pieces are “fiscal in nature,” meaning they\ncan be moved quickly through a budget maneuver that\nrequires a simple majority in the Senate and House.\n9\nUse of “Budget Reconciliation” to enact legislation\ninvolves a two-step process. First, both Chambers of\nCongress need to pass a concurrent Budget Resolution\n(requires only simple majority in the Senate) that contains\n“reconciliation instructions.” These instructions are\ndirections to committees of jurisdiction to change the\nspending or revenue numbers (or both), and to report\nback the changes by a date certain. A budget resolution\ngenerally is a legislative vehicle that serves as the\nblueprint for fiscal policy and establishes a framework for\nconsideration of spending and revenue bills for the\ncoming fiscal year. Technically, a budget resolution is a\n“concurrent resolution” which is binding in the House and\nthe Senate. Because a concurrent resolution is not\nsubmitted to the President for signature, it does not have\nthe force of law.\nThe second part of the process is to pass “reconciliation”\nbills that adhere to the reconciliation instructions from\nthe budget resolution.\nReconciliation bills can involve changes to spending,\nrevenue, or the debt limit (or any combination of the\nthree). Importantly, these reconciliation bills also only\nrequire a simple majority in the House and Senate for\npassage.\nReconciliation bills carry strict debate time and\namendment restrictions, but unlike a budget resolution,\nreconciliation legislation contains specific spending and\nrevenue policy changes that are signed into law by the\nPresident. In the Senate, debate is limited to 20 hours.\nWhile only a simple majority is required for passage in the\nSenate, 60 votes are required to waive violations of the\nso-called “Byrd rule,” which prohibits the inclusion of\nprovisions that increase the budget deficit for the period\noutside the budget window, usually a 10-year period. An\nunlimited number of amendments may be offered and\nvoted upon, even after the 20 hours of debate have\nexpired – a process often referred to as a “vote-a-rama”.\nThis process is attractive because of the simple majority\nvote in the Senate, but carries with it restrictions such as\nthe ten-year expiration for titles of the bill that increase\nthe deficit outside the budget window.\nIt was used by President George W. Bush to pass\nsignificant tax cut legislation in 2001 (the “Bush tax\ncuts”) and is expected to be considered next year for tax\nreform. Note that the Bush tax cuts were originally\nsunsetted at the end of ten years due to the Byrd\nrule. Subsequent legislation passed outside reconciliation\nprocess made many of these provisions permanent.\n| Election 2016\nAdministration and\nagenda\nDebt limit. The debt limit will be reinstated after March\n15, 2017, though Congress will likely have additional time\nto either suspend or increase the limit. Extraordinary\nmeasures that can be undertaken by the Treasury\nDepartment should allow Treasury to continue meeting its\nfinancial obligations until at least midsummer of 2017,\naccording to a September 13 posting by the Bipartisan\nPolicy Center. When the debt limit is reinstated, the\nfederal government’s accumulated debt will immediately\nequal the new ceiling, which is projected to be\nabout $20.1 trillion. The optics of the figure surpassing\n$20 trillion could spur lawmakers to be even more\nadamant about demands for spending cuts in return for\nsupporting an additional increase or suspension of the\ndebt limit.\nFAA reauthorization. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund\ntaxes expire after September 30, 2017, along with\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) spending authority,\nboth of which were last extended in July. Privatization of\nthe air traffic control system was a sticking point in\nnegotiations this year. The FAA bill can be a vehicle for\nother tax legislation.\nPersonnel. The fact that Trump has not held political\noffice and is not a traditional Republican puts a new spin\non filling out his administration. Press reports have\nspeculated about potential cabinet appointments. Trump\nhas reportedly said that Goldman Sachs alumnus and\ncampaign finance chairman Steven Mnuchin could be a\npossible nominee for Treasury secretary.\nEconomic advisers that have represented Trump on the\ncampaign include investor Wilbur Ross and economists\nPeter Navarro, Larry Kudlow, and Stephen Moore.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is in charge of Trump’s\ntransition. Politicians who have supported and served as\nsurrogates for Trump and could possibly be tapped for\nCabinet posts include: former New York mayor Rudy\nGiuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senator\nJeff Sessions (R-AL), Dr. Ben Carson, and former Alaska\nGovernor Sarah Palin. Senate Foreign Relations\nCommittee Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) was reportedly\nunder consideration for the vice presidential pick and\ncould be tapped for a Cabinet post.\nEconomic packages pursued by past presidents\nBarack Obama\nTook office January 20, 2009\nGeorge W.

Congress returns the week of November 14\nfor organizational meetings and then departs again for\nThanksgiving week, leaving lawmakers only a couple of\nweeks to finish their legislative business. Other\npossibilities include: a defense authorization bill; the\nconference report for an omnibus energy bill; the “21 st\nCentury Cures” bill increasing funds for medical research\nand accelerating drug approvals; the Water Resources\nDevelopment Act (WRDA), which would also carry money\nto address the drinking-water crisis in Flint, Michigan; tax\nextenders provisions; and retirement savings measures.\nGovernment Funding. Under the stopgap continuing\nresolution (CR) cleared on September 28, funding for the\ngovernment will expire on December 9. Only one of the\n12 fiscal 2017 appropriations bills has been sent to the\nPresident so far. The government funding bill may take\nthe form of a large omnibus bill or continuing resolution,\nif the House and Senate Republican leadership’s\npreference for moving spending bills on a standalone\nbasis or in packages does not pan out. Given the election\nresults, leaders are likely to limit the length of the\nspending bill to a handful of months to allow the Trump\nadministration an opportunity to help shape fiscal 2017\nspending next year. Speaker Ryan has said he favors a\nstrategy of combining spending bills into “minibus”\nvehicles, but Senate Democrats have said such an\napproach could be a tactic to get around the spending\ncaps Congress agreed to on a bipartisan basis last year.\nThe bill(s) may include additional spending to address\nflooding in Louisiana and elsewhere, and damage from\nHurricane Matthew. If the vehicle for government funding\nis a large omnibus bill, Republicans may push for some\nconservative policy “riders” as their price for accepting\nthe budget numbers that were negotiated last year.\nTax. There are no must-pass tax issues for the lame-duck\nsession, and it is unclear whether there will be\nconsideration of expiring tax provisions, House and\nSenate miscellaneous tax bills, and tax technical\ncorrections. House Ways and Means Chairman Brady is\nopposed to addressing tax extender provisions this year,\npreferring to look forward to tax reform; that could also\nbe the position taken on other tax issues given that\nRepublicans will control Washington and have a shared\ninterest in tax reform. However, Senate Leader McConnell\npreviously committed to addressing energy tax extenders\nthis year, so they could still come up for consideration.\n11\nPensions. The Senate could consider the Retirement\nEnhancement and Savings Act, a package of measures\naffecting multiple-employer pension plans, 401(k) plans\nand annuities, which was approved on a unanimous vote\nby the Senate Finance Committee on September 21. The\ncommittee also approved the Miners Protection Act, which\nwould fund retiree health and pension benefits for coal\nminers, which a majority of the committee’s Republican\nmembers opposed.\nHealth. One of the top Republican legislative priorities for\nthe lame-duck session is the 21 st Century Cures bill, a\npackage of measures intended to spur new medical\ntreatments and boost funding for the National Institutes of\nHealth, the FDA, and White House initiatives such as\n“precision medicine” and the Cancer Moonshot. Questions\nremain in both the House and Senate over how to pay for\nthe bill and the size of the funding increases, but Senator\nMcConnell has said the bill “could end up being the most\nsignificant piece of legislation we pass in the whole\nCongress.”\nOn the House side, this continues to be the top priority of\nthe Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee\nFred Upton. Leaders of the Energy and Commerce\nCommittee said on September 29 that they had been\n“working hard for months, and we will continue to work\ntoward an agreement that can pass both chambers and be\nsigned by the President.” The House passed its version of\nthe 21 st Century Cures bill (H.R. 6) in July 2015 by a vote\nof 344-77, including nearly $9 billion in new research\nfunding for the NIH and reforms to the FDA’s process for\napproving certain new medicines and medical devices. In\nthe Senate, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n(HELP) Committee has passed a package of 19 bills aimed\nat accelerating approval of new drugs and medical devices\nand attracting talented researchers to the FDA, but the full\nSenate has yet to consider the bills. HELP Committee\nChairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN) told Bloomberg BNA in\nJune that the impediments to passage are the proposals’\ncomplexity and disagreements over how to pay for\nthem. Negotiations continue.\nSpeaker Ryan has also listed passage of mental health\nlegislation as one of his priorities for the lame-duck\nsession. H.R. 2646, a bill sponsored by Rep. Tim Murphy\n(R-PA) that passed the House almost unanimously in July,\nwould expand Medicaid coverage of mental health\nservices, fund more psychiatric hospital beds and change\nprivacy rules to allow caregivers to receive more\ninformation about patients.\n| Election 2016\nLame-duck session\nA Senate version (S. 2680) prompted Democratic\nconcerns over funding levels, privacy issues, and other\nmatters. This issue is one that could slip into the next\nCongress if negotiators are unable to reach an agreement\ngiven the limited time available.\nAnother outstanding year-end issue for Congressional\nleaders is whether to address the pending Medicare Part-\nB premium increases facing new and some existing\nMedicare enrollees caused by a smaller annual Social\nSecurity cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). Congress has\nacted in the past to avert premium increases due to\nmodest COLA adjustments before the premium increases\ntake effect. Additional Medicare changes that are\nbipartisan in nature could be added to this Part B\nadjustment if leaders agree to move forward. Up for\npotential consideration are a handful of Medicare-related\nbills that have already passed the House or Senate in the\n114 th Congress, as well as a package of provisions\nrecently unveiled by the Finance Committee that would\naddress how chronic conditions are managed in the\nMedicare population.\nAdditionally, Congress continues to contemplate action in\nthe lame duck session to address the Obama\nAdministration’s proposal to modify the payment\nmechanisms for Part B Medicare drugs. While the\nproposal has not yet been finalized, concerns about the\nsize and scope of the proposal have been raised by\nCongress.\nEnergy. House and Senate conferees also hope to finish\nnegotiating the final version of the bipartisan, omnibus\nEnergy Policy Modernization Act (S. 2012, H.R. 8).\nAmong many other provisions, that bill would give the\nEnergy Department emergency authority to protect the\nelectric power grid from physical and cyber threats;\nrequire the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n(FERC) to expedite consideration of pipeline siting\napplications; ease procedures for mining certain minerals\non federal lands; increase water allocations to address\ndrought in California; and change forestry management.\nThere will also be a push to complete the Water Resources\nDevelopment Act (WRDA). In September, both the Senate\n(S. 2848) and House (H.R. 5303) overwhelmingly passed\nbills that need to be reconciled, but the two chambers\nhave not yet formally gone to conference. One factor that\nis likely to expedite a conference and floor votes is the fact\nthat in September, in order to resolve a deadlock over\ngovernment funding, Speaker Ryan made a commitment\nto move assistance to Flint, Michigan (which has faced a\ndrinking-water crisis) as part of the WRDA bill.\nEnergy measures could also come up as Republican\n“riders” on a year-end spending bill, such as provisions\nblocking the EPA’s Clean Power Plan or the “Waters of the\nU.S.” wetlands rule. House Majority Leader McCarthy has\nalso said the House will consider a bill offering a tax credit\nfor new nuclear reactors.\nFinancial Services. House Financial Services Chairman\nJeb Hensarling (R-TX) has said he hopes for a lame-duck\nfloor vote on his CHOICE Act, which would repeal much of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with a system in which\nbanks would become exempt from many prudential rules if\nthey agree to a much higher leverage ratio. The committee\npassed the CHOICE Act on a party-line vote in September.\nThe Wells Fargo scandal could pose a hurdle for that plan,\nbecause Hensarling’s bill would repeal the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) new rules limiting the\nuse of mandatory arbitration clauses in bank contracts.\nWells Fargo has been criticized for requiring its account\nholders to agree to such clauses, restricting their ability to\nsue the bank after as many as 2 million unauthorized\naccounts were discovered.\nThe Financial Services Committee will hold a second\nhearing on November 30 on the Wells Fargo issue, with\nCFPB Director Richard Cordray testifying. SEC Chairman\nMary Jo White will also testify on November 15.\n12\n| Election 2016\nTax\nThe surprising results of yesterday’s election have teed\nup comprehensive tax reform as a clear priority for the\nnew Republican President and the Republican Congress.\nA unified Republican government makes the process of\nachieving significant tax reform much more manageable\nnext year, in particular because Speaker Ryan during the\ncampaign pledged to move such a plan in the form of socalled\nbudget reconciliation legislation, which would mean\nthat only a simple majority of senators would be\nnecessary to pass the plan, rather than the usual 60-vote\nmajority. A lot of the groundwork has been laid through\nproposals and negotiations over the last three or four\nyears on various key aspects of business tax reform, but\nCongressional Republican leaders and the new President\nwill have to decide whether to push forward with\nlegislation that embodies the House Republican Tax\nReform Blueprint, or the outlines of a tax reform plan that\nPresident-elect Trump championed during the campaign.\nOne significant difference is that the Blueprint, according\nto its authors, is largely revenue neutral using dynamic\nscoring, while the Trump plan was scored by various nongovernmental\ngroups as losing trillions of dollars.\nHouse Speaker Ryan has said on multiple occasions that\ntax reform is his top priority. The Blueprint, the sixth and\nfinal plank of Ryan’s “Better Way” campaign to provide\npolicy alternatives, proposed a 20% statutory corporate\ntax rate, a 25% business tax rate for pass-through\nentities, a move toward a cash-flow consumption tax\nthrough immediate expensing for all businesses and\nelimination of deductibility of net interest expense, a\nterritorial international tax system, a border tax\nadjustment mechanism, and elimination of most business\npreferences except the R&D tax credit and LIFO.\nInterestingly, all of these pieces of business tax reform\nmay be fair game in discussions with Democrats, but the\ntwo parties differ greatly over whether to reduce\nindividual tax rates – a key component of both the\nBlueprint and the Trump campaign agenda – and over\nimportant revenue issues, including whether reform\nshould be revenue neutral on a static basis, and whether\ntiming and one-time revenue raisers should be used to\npay for permanent tax rate reduction. The use of budget\nreconciliation, however, could make many of these\ndifferences irrelevant as Senate Democrats could have\nlittle power to change or block the legislation on the\nSenate floor.\nAlong with the 20% statutory corporate tax rate, the\nBlueprint includes a 25% business tax rate for passthrough\nentities; and individual rates set at 12%, 25%, and\n33%.\n13\nWays and Means Republican tax staff is in the process of\nreceiving feedback and building out the tax reform\nBlueprint by drafting detailed statutory language. The\npublicly expressed goal is to have that effort completed\nby the end of 2016. In October 14 remarks at University\nof Wisconsin—Madison, House Speaker Ryan said, “I really\nwant to get tax reform running as quickly as possible…”\nAsked September 29 whether there is opportunity for\nprogress on big-ticket items in 2017, Senate Majority\nLeader McConnell said, “We need to do tax-reform –\ncomprehensive tax-reform – not piecemeal.”\nTrump’s tax plan differs from the Blueprint in that the\ncorporate tax rate would be lower – 15% – with the same\nrate imposed on pass through entities. The latest\nstatement from the Trump campaign suggests that small\nbusiness owners do not retain earnings may face double\ntaxation.\nIndividual income tax rates would be 12%, 25%, and 33%,\nthe same as the House Republican tax reform Blueprint.\nTrump and his staff have supported a 10% tax rate on the\ndeemed repatriation of previously untaxed foreign\nearnings of US companies, but the campaign never made\nclear whether they still support repeal of deferral in a new\ninternational tax system going forward.\nTrump has pledged to work with House Republicans on\ntax issues and, in addition to adopting their proposed\nindividual rates, brought his plan closer to theirs by\nannouncing support for immediate expensing of new\nbusiness investments for manufacturers. The House plan\nproposed expensing in conjunction with eliminating the\ndeductibility of net interest expense. In the follow-up to a\nSeptember 15 speech to the Economic Club of New York,\nTrump clarified that he believes expensing should be\nlimited to manufacturers and those who elect expensing\nwill lose the deductibility of corporate interest expense.\nThe Trump campaign also clarified in September that they\nfavored repeal of most corporate tax expenditures,\nexcept for the R&D Credit. While continuing to call for\nrepeal of the estate tax, Trump proposed disallowing a\nstep-up in basis for estates over $10 million: “The Trump\nplan will repeal the death tax, but capital gains held until\ndeath will be subject to tax, with the first $10 million taxfree\nas under current law to exempt small businesses and\nfamily farms. To prevent abuse, contributions of\nappreciated assets into a private charity established by\nthe decedent or the decedent’s relatives will be\ndisallowed.”\n| Election 2016\nTax\nTrump additionally proposed capping itemized deductions\nat $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for married\nfilers and highlighted the benefits of his proposals for\nworking Americans and the middle class. “By lowering\nrates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the\nprocess, we will add millions and millions of new jobs. In\naddition, because we have strongly capped deductions for\nthe wealthy, and closed special interest loopholes, the tax\nrelief will be concentrated on the working and middle\nclass taxpayer…,” he said. “This is a working and middleclass\ntax relief proposal.” A campaign fact sheet\nproclaims that Trump’s economic proposals would add 25\nmillion jobs over a decade, which equates to 200,000 new\njobs per month.\nThe motivating factors for tax reform will remain the\nsame as they were in the current Congress, but unified\ngovernment should make enacting tax reform much\neasier. The statutory corporate income tax rate is seen as\ntoo high and the international tax system compels profit\nshifting to low-tax jurisdictions and erodes the US tax\nbase. That phenomenon escalated this year with the\nEuropean Commission’s latest state aid decision, which\nwas seen as demonstrating a tension between the US and\nEurope over who should tax the foreign income of US\nmultinationals.\nThe passage of the EU’s harmful tax competition directive\nwill lead to enactment in all EU countries of a variety of\nmeasures that could increase taxes on US companies\noperating in Europe, while implementation of innovation\nbox regimes in many countries, following the OECD BEPS\nproject outline, will make it more attractive for US\ncompanies to move intellectual property and exploit that\nIP into those jurisdictions. The Administration took\nsignificant steps this year to try to prevent further\nerosion of the US tax base through regulatory action to\ndeter inversions and earnings stripping, but all involved\nsaid these were Band-Aid approaches that were no\nsubstitute for US tax reform.\nDesign issues – international tax reform. As has been the\ncase for the last few years, there is broad agreement on\nthe design elements of business tax reform, and more\nspecifically, international tax reform, but the devil is in\nthe details. For example, the House Republican Blueprint\non tax reform calls for a 8.75% tax rate on previously\nuntaxed accumulated foreign earnings held in cash or\ncash equivalents, and a 3.5% tax rate on all other\naccumulated earnings, with tax liability payable over an\neight-year period.\nThis is the same tax treatment of accumulated foreign\nearnings called for under former Ways and Means\nCommittee Chairman Dave Camp’s (R-MI) Tax Reform Act\nof 2014.\nBut in a departure from the Camp bill, the Blueprint also\ncalls for a move to a destination-basis tax system, under\nwhich border adjustments exempt exports from tax while\ntaxing imports, making the tax jurisdiction the location of\nconsumption rather than production. Exempting exports\nfrom US tax and taxing imports regardless of where they\nare produced will eliminate incentives for US businesses\nto move or locate operations outside of the United States\nunder a territorial tax system, according to the Blueprint.\nBy relieving exports from US tax while imposing US tax on\nimports, the Blueprint would eliminate the need for any\nnew exemption or territorial tax system to be\naccompanied by a minimum tax or any other more\nconventional anti-base erosion measure, thereby\nsidestepping one of the more intractable and divisive\ndebates among the business community over the past\nseveral years of tax reform discussions.\nDeveloping a workable border adjustability mechanism\nthat is not actually a component of a value-added tax\npresents some significant policy and technical hurdles.\nUS companies that are net exporters could end up in a\nperpetual tax loss position, and handing out refunds to\nsome of the largest US companies may not work from a\npolitical standpoint, particularly as the domestic income\nof US companies (including the suppliers for exporting\ncompanies) is subject to tax. How to apply the border\nadjustability concept to cross-border flows of capital, or\nwhether to exempt financial transactions must also be\nconsidered.\nWhile moving to a form of exemption system has some\nlevel of bipartisan support, more liberal Democrats will\ninsist on a more pure worldwide system that includes\nrepeal of deferral. Senate Finance Committee Ranking\nMember Wyden (intermittently) and Senator Warren\n(consistently) have both backed the latter approach, and\nSpeaker Ryan noted the differing viewpoints in\nSeptember given that Democrats increasingly call for a\nworldwide system and repeal of deferral.\n14\n| Election 2016\nTax\n“There is a big gulf between our two views... We believe\nthat we should have a pure territorial system… And so I do\nbelieve that this issue is coming,” Ryan said. “I don’t think\nyou can stand against a territorial system much longer.”\nRyan also remarked that “the experience I had when I was\nWays and Means chair with [Democrats] was not a\npleasant one, and I don’t know if that’s going to change.”\nIn a September 8 New York Times op-ed, Senator Warren\nsaid foreign developments are increasing pressure on\nCongress to cut corporations “a new sweetheart deal” in\ntax reform, but lawmakers should instead take the\nopportunity to collect more revenue from corporations.\n“Preferential tax treatment, either through special rates\nor deferred due dates, creates a huge financial incentive\nfor American companies to build businesses and create\njobs abroad rather than in the United States. Our tax code\nshould favor jobs and businesses at home – period,”\nWarren said.\nAlong with these political and mechanical questions, there\nis the question of whether such a system, embedded in an\nincome tax rather than a value added tax or other true\nconsumption tax, is legal from an international trade\nperspective.\nDesign issues – paying for rate reduction. There may\nalso be tension among House Republicans given that the\nBlueprint has not had a full airing among members – it\nwas released soon before Congress left for its summer\nrecess – and the drafting of legislative language may\nmake apparent what is necessary to achieve the stated\ngoals, particularly the reduced rates: a 20% statutory\ncorporate tax rate; a 25% business tax rate for passthrough\nentities; and individual rates set at 12%, 25%, and\n33%. Once the details are hashed out, the Blueprint could\npresent just as many trade-offs as previous serious tax\nreform proposals. While the mix of winners and losers\nmay be different than under other proposals, the ultimate\nfate of the Blueprint will still be determined by the same\nfundamental political dynamics that would face any tax\nreform proposal.\nFor example, the Blueprint would permit companies to\nfully and immediately deduct the cost of all tangible and\nintangible property, with the exception of land. However,\nthe Blueprint also would correspondingly deny deductions\nfor net interest expense. Companies must therefore\nweigh whether losing interest deductions is a cost they\nare willing to incur in exchange for full expensing (and a\n20% corporate rate).\nThe purpose for denying deductions for net interest\nexpense is to prevent a presumed double benefit from\nfully expensing leveraged purchases of property.\nHowever, the exclusion of land from full expensing under\nthe Blueprint would be particularly severe for debtfinanced\npurchases of land because the land would not be\neligible for full expensing (or apparently even\ndepreciation as under current law), while deductions for\ninterest expense on the debt would not be permitted.\nMoreover, the persistent issues under current law\ninvolving the allocation of purchase price between nondeductible\nland and immediately deductible\nimprovements on the land would be intensified under the\nBlueprint. Other aspects of paying for a reduced\ncorporate rate will not come easier in the new Congress.\nThe allure of reducing business tax rates did not draw\nmembers to support the bill presented to them by former\nWays and Means Chairman Dave Camp.\nCorporate integration. In the Senate, Finance Committee\nChairman Hatch continues to go his own direction on tax\nreform, touting a corporate integration plan that could be\na substitute for or be complementary to a rate reduction\neffort that includes international tax reform. Hatch says\nhe is still aiming to release a corporate integration\ndiscussion draft. Chairman Hatch has said the proposal\ncould accomplish the international tax reform that is\nwidely seen as necessary, and the reception to the draft\ncould dictate how strongly he tries to advance the\nproposal next year. The draft is expected to pair a\ndividends-paid deduction with a mandatory 35%\nwithholding tax for dividends and interest. Other senators\nand third parties have raised concerns about a corporate\nintegration plan, including:\n► that the proposed 35% withholding tax expected would\npenalize tax-exempt entities like retirement plans and\ndeter foreign investment in the United States; and\n► that a dividends paid deduction would, by reducing\ncorporate tax liability, diminish the effectiveness of\ncurrent tax incentives like the R&D credit and\naccelerated depreciation, and disadvantage startup\ncompanies more likely to retain their earnings rather\nthan pay dividends.\nExtenders. The fate of tax extenders (and certain other\ntax issues) will likely depend on both what can be\naccomplished during the 2016 lame-duck session and the\nsuccess of the likely focus on tax reform in early 2017.\n15\n| Election 2016\nTax\nThere is a push to include the provisions that expire at the\nend of 2016 in year-end legislation, though if that is\nunsuccessful the issue will certainly return in 2017, either\nthrough inclusion in a tax reform measure or separately if\nthose efforts have played out.\nThe 2015 tax legislation made some extender provisions\npermanent and extended others for five years, meaning\nthe two-year extensions that expire at the end of 2016\nwill be the focus of the next effort.\nThere will certainly be attention paid to these provisions\nduring any discussion of tax extenders in 2017.\nTax treaties. Action on the eight Foreign Relations\nCommittee-approved tax treaties that Senator Rand Paul\n(R-KY) wants renegotiated over information sharing\nconcerns is seen as overdue. The treaties include: new\nprotocols amending US tax treaties with Switzerland,\nLuxembourg, Spain and Japan; new tax treaties with\nHungary, Chile and Poland; and a multilateral convention\non tax administration. There have been no plans\nannounced for trying to move the treaties during the\nlame-duck session, though such an effort is possible.\nState tax issues. In August, House Judiciary Committee\nChairman Goodlatte released a second discussion draft\nrelated to remote sales tax that would apply tax at the\ndestination state of the goods, rather than on the location\nof the seller, which was his previous approach. The tax\nwould be imposed at a single rate determined by the state\nof the purchaser, but using the tax base of the state of\norigin.\nChairman Goodlatte wanted a vote this year on the\nproposal, which had the support of Speaker Ryan, but this\nvote is not likely to occur during the lame duck session.\nWhen Congress approved a customs reauthorization\nmeasure that made permanent the Internet Tax Freedom\nAct in February, Senate Majority Leader McConnell said\nhe had provided assurances to supporters of the\nMarketplace Fairness Act “that we’ll have an opportunity\nto consider that sometime this year.” Since that is not\nlikely to occur during the lame-duck session, the issue is\nsure to resurface in 2017.\nIn September, the House approved by voice vote the\nMobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act\n(H.R. 2315), to prohibit wages earned by an employee\nwho performs employment duties in more than one state\nfrom being subject to income tax in any state other than:\n(1) the state of the employee’s residence, and (2) the\nstate within which the employee is present and\nperforming employment duties for more than 30 days\nduring the calendar year. Senate Finance Committee\nmember John Thune (R-SD) sponsors a Senate version of\nthe bill (S. 386), though the outlook for the issue is\nunclear.\n16\n| Election 2016\nHealth\nWith a Trump win and Republicans maintaining control of\nthe House and Senate, the health agenda promises to be\none of the greatest policy areas of change in the next\nCongress.\nACA Repeal/Replace. In January, following a 240-181\nvote, the House sent to the President H.R. 3762,\nRestoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation\nAct – a piece of legislation which dismantled key\nprovisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The same\nlegislation was approved in the Senate on a vote of 52 to\n47. Although the President ultimately vetoed the\nlegislation, it represents a blueprint for Congressional\naction in 2017 to repeal core components of the ACA.\nThe reconciliation process allows leaders to call up\nlegislation and pass it with a simple majority vote in the\nSenate—avoiding a potential filibuster. Reconciliation\nrules in the Senate are complex, enforced by the Senate\nParliamentarian, and constrained by CBO scoring rules\nand conventions – which combine to determine what can\nand cannot be included in a reconciliation bill.\nReconciliation is a powerful tool but its use is limited to\npolicy changes that have a direct impact on taxing or\nspending levels. Because they have used this process\nbefore, Republicans have a road map of the changes that\nwill be possible through the use of reconciliation in a\nclosely divided Senate. Find a link to a summary of the\nReconciliation bill that passed in 2015 here. Donald\nTrump has been less prescriptive in terms of the specifics\nof the ACA replace plan that he supports. But generally,\nhe has called for a special session of Congress to\ncompletely repeal the ACA and replace it with a plan that\nallows consumers to buy insurance across state lines,\nallow individuals to deduct the cost of health care on their\nfederal tax returns, expand Health Savings Accounts\n(HSAs) and block grant Medicaid. Speaker Paul Ryan and\nthe House GOP introduced a proposal to replace the ACA\nthat can be found here. Because the Senate GOP did not\nintroduce their own ACA replace plan, negotiations\nbetween the chambers will be required before a strategy\nis developed.\nUser Fee Legislation. The Senate HELP Committee and\nthe House Energy and Commerce Committee are tasked\nwith the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee\nAct (PDUFA), the Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA), the\nBiosimiliar User Fee Act (BsUFA), the Medical Device User\nFee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA). These programs\nmust be reauthorized in 2017 to ensure that sufficient\nindustry fees are available for the FDA to continue to\nconsider the applications of drugs and devices.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and relevant\nindustries have reached draft agreements on the user fee\nproposals. The proposals are historically bipartisan\npriorities and are expected to be approved by Congress\nnext year. Some of the drug pricing issues raised by\nDemocrats in 2016 could potentially become embroiled in\nthe FDA user fee legislation negotiations. Even though\nDonald Trump has voiced some populist concerns about\nthe increasing cost of prescription drugs, the risk of drug\npricing policy changes being enacted next year are less\nlikely given that Hillary Clinton did not win the White\nHouse and the GOP continues to control the House and\nSenate. But Democrats are likely to continue to highlight\nthe issue and seek policy changes to address it.\nMental Health/ Opioids. Currently, discussions are\nongoing to find a compromise that can be enacted on\nmental health legislation in the lame duck Congress and\npossible further action to address the opioid addiction\ncrisis that was such a big issue in so many election\ncampaigns. But disagreements over funding levels, gun\nissues and the privacy of medical records persist. It\nremains to be seen if negotiators can reach agreement on\nthese issues in the lame duck session of Congress or if the\nissue will be revisited in the next Congress.\nMACRA Oversight. Congressional oversight of the\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS)\nimplementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP\nReauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) is expected to\ncontinue following several House and Senate hearings\nheld over the past several months and recent publication\nof a final rule on the matter.\nIn 2015 Congress passed MACRA which overhauls how\nMedicare pays for physician services. The legislation\nrepealed the Medicare physician sustainable growth rate\n(SGR) formula and instead moves to a new two-track\npayment system called the Quality Payment Program\n(QPP). The two tracks of the QPP seek to tie an increased\npercentage of physicians’ Medicare fee-for-service\npayments to outcomes through the Merit Based Incentive\nPayment System (MIPS) and also to encourage the\nadoption of alternative payment models (APMs).\nAt recent House and Senate hearings, members from\nboth parties expressed concern about MACRA’s potential\nadverse impact on smaller independent and rural\nphysician practices. While the final rule attempts to\naddress these concerns, it is expected that Congress will\ncontinue to utilize its oversight power to monitor\nimplementation.\n17\n| Election 2016\nHealth\nHealthcare Reauthorization Priorities. The Children’s\nHealth Insurance Plan (CHIP) will expire and needs to be\nreauthorized in 2017. CHIP is a federal and state\npartnership program which provides health coverage to\nan estimated 8.9 million low-income children. In 2015,\nPresident Obama signed the Medicare Access and CHIP\nReauthorization Act which extended CHIP for an\nadditional two years; without an extension of the program\nin 2017 the program will exhaust its funding and states\nwill be required to continue the children’s coverage\nthrough Medicaid until 2019, due to the ACA’s\nmaintenance of effort (MOE) provision unless the ACA is\nrepealed. The reauthorization process will create an\nopportunity to consider additional policy changes\nincluding changes to the CHIP and Medicaid programs.\nThe ACA also created a funding stream for community\nhealth centers. In 2015, a bipartisan vote in Congress\nextended the Community Health Center Fund by an\nadditional two years (FY 2016 and FY 2017). It is likely\nthat lawmakers will push to extend funding of community\nhealth centers into future years beyond 2017.\nChronic Care. In late October, Senate Finance Committee\nChairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden along with\nSenators Johnny Isakson (R–GA) and Mark Warner (D-VA),\nco-chairs of the Finance Committee Chronic Care Working\nGroup, released a discussion draft with proposals to\nimprove health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries living\nwith chronic conditions. Potential Senate legislative\naction on the discussion draft is possible in the lame duck\nsession, but it is also possible the bill will be taken up in\nthe next Congress.\n18\n| Election 2016\nEnergy\nDonald Trump is widely expected to significantly depart\nfrom the priorities of the Obama Administration by\nfavoring development of additional conventional energy\nresources and attempting to put the brakes on new\nenvironmental initiatives. The GOP majorities in the\nHouse and Senate have a similar agenda and Democrats\nin Congress are expected to mobilize in opposition -- in\nparticular by leveraging their power in the Senate to\nfilibuster legislation – and publicly highlight the potential\nimpacts of a Trump administration’s policies.\nTrump has pledged to cancel US participation in the 2015\nParis Climate agreement, and opposes implementation of\nthe Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP). His\ncampaign literature is heavily salted with proposals to\nprovide regulatory relief to fossil fuel industries and\nslanted in favor of new administrative initiatives to foster\nconventional energy development. Specifically, his\nwebsite calls for the following energy-related initiatives:\n► Make America energy independent, create millions of\nnew jobs, and protect clean air and clean water;\nconserve our natural habitats, reserves and resources;\nunleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new\nwealth to our country.\n► Declare American energy dominance a strategic\neconomic and foreign policy goal of the United\nStates.\n► Unleash America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil,\nand natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in\nclean coal reserves.\n► Become, and stay, totally independent of any need to\nimport energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations\nhostile to our interests.\n► Open onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands,\neliminate moratorium on coal leasing, and open shale\nenergy deposits.\n► Encourage the use of natural gas and other American\nenergy resources that will both reduce emissions but\nalso reduce the price of energy and increase our\neconomic output.\n► Rescind all job-destroying Obama executive actions.\nMr. Trump will reduce and eliminate all barriers to\nresponsible energy production, creating at least a half\nmillion jobs a year, $30 billion in higher wages, and\ncheaper energy.\nGiven the predominance of oil and gas executives\namongst his kitchen cabinet, it is also widely expected\nthat President-elect Trump will try to halt additional\nenvironmental regulatory measures proposed by the\nObama Administration, such as methane emission\ncurbs. It should be noted that it is difficult legally to\nchange or repeal regulations which have been\npromulgated in final form – such as the CPP – without\ngoing through the Administrative Procedures Act\nprocess. Environmental lawyers can be expected to\nlitigate at every step of the way if Trump attempts to\nbypass Congress and eliminate the CPP by Executive\nOrder, and the courts may well serve as a brake on such\nactions. However, environmental advocates who would\nhave likely tried to push a President Clinton to\nadministratively expand the scope of the CPP’s carbon\nemission regulations beyond the electric power sector,\npotentially economy-wide under Section 115 of the Clean\nAir Act, may now be left to using a litigation route to try\nto force the Environmental Protection Agency to expand\nthe CPP to achieve this goal.\nDuring the campaign, Trump also specifically rejected the\nidea of using a carbon tax/carbon pricing as a means of\nencouraging market-driven emission reductions. With\nGOP chairmen of the tax-writing committees in the House\nand Senate, it is very unlikely that they will schedule\nhearings or markups to move carbon taxes – other than to\nschedule votes in the House or Senate aimed at\nundermining vulnerable Democrats up for reelection in\n2018.\nAdditionally, the President-elect has vowed to allow\nenergy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline\nand other industrial facilities which have faced denials or\ndelays under the current Administration, to move\nforward. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure\nplan that would rely heavily on private-public partnerships\nby providing a tax credit to encourage private investors to\nfund projects overseen by states and municipalities. As\nconceived by Trump’s advisors, the tax credit would apply\nto infrastructure projects with a dedicated source of\nrevenue, such as toll roads, airports or utilities financed\nat least in part by fees paid by users. Decisions on which\nprojects to fund would generally be left to the states.\n19\n| Election 2016\nEnergy\nTrump’s tax reform plans generally adhere to the\nprecepts of the House Republican tax reform Blueprint,\nbut he differs with that outline in some important\nrespects. The House Blueprint proposes, among other\nthings, to allow 100% expensing of qualified business\ninvestments and to deny the deductibility of net business\ninterest expenses. It would also eliminate most fossil fuelspecific\ntax incentives such as deductions for intangible\ndrilling costs (IDCs) and percentage depletion, but its\nproposal to allow expensing of all business investment\nwould mitigate the loss of many of the specific\ndeductions. The Blueprint appears to allow both\nindependent and integrated producers to deduct 100% of\nIDCs in the year they are paid or incurred. While this\nwould preserve the status quo for independent producers,\nallowing integrated oil and gas companies to also expense\n100% of IDCs could increase the rate of return on oil and\ngas wells drilled by integrated companies. This change, in\ncombination with the possible loss of the percentage\ndepletion deduction (which allows cost recovery in excess\nof cost basis) could ultimately make independent\nproducers less competitive with integrated companies.\nTrump offered qualified support for the Blueprint’s\nproposal to allow 100% expensing – but would limit the\nprovision to manufacturers – and those who elect\nexpensing will lose the deductibility of business interest\nexpenses. Further, he may be more inclined to keep\ntraditional fossil fuel-specific tax incentives, such as the\ndeduction for intangible drilling costs and the percentage\ndepletion deduction.\nWhile President-elect Trump has spent much of his time\ndiscussing federal policy issues surrounding conventional\nenergy resources, he has expressed opposition to\ncontinued federal support for the development of wind\nand solar energy and has said that he will eliminate all\nfederal spending for clean energy research. How he\nproceeds in the new Congress may be heavily influenced\nby both electoral politics (e.g., ethanol-rich Iowa largely\nsupported his candidacy) and the pre-existing dynamics in\nCongress. Many congressional Republicans have opposed\neven temporary extensions of renewable energy\nincentives and the fate of these provisions may well be\nlinked to the effectiveness of the Democratic minority.\n20\n| Election 2016\nFinancial Services\nRepublicans’ retention of the House and Senate majorities\nmeans that President-elect Trump will have partners in\nboth banking committees to help implement an agenda\nheavy on deregulation. The new Senate Banking\nCommittee chairman will be Mike Crapo (R-ID), who has a\nsolid working relationship with returning Ranking Member\nSherrod Brown (D-OH) and could work productively with\nhim in a handful of areas. On the House side, Rep. Jeb\nHensarling (R-TX) returns as chairman of the Financial\nServices Committee. A fierce opponent of the 2010\nDodd-Frank Act, Hensarling will have Trump’s support in\nrenewing his effort to repeal and replace the Dodd-Frank\nAct and continuing the panel’s aggressive oversight of\nfinancial regulators. Given Republicans’ narrow majority\nin the Senate, Democrats’ ability to filibuster\ncontroversial bills in that chamber will make it difficult for\nHouse and Senate GOP leaders to push through a broad\ndismantling of major elements of Dodd-Frank, something\nthe President-elect called for during the campaign. But\ngiven that Republicans will have full control of the\nexecutive and legislative branches for the first time since\n2006, the GOP base will be dismayed if they don’t try\nanyway. Short of that broader effort, bipartisan\ncompromises in the areas of bank capital and regulatory\nrelief for smaller banks seem achievable.\nSenate Banking Committee. Crapo is widely seen as\nworking constructively with Sen. Brown – a stark contrast\nto Brown’s relationship with current Chairman Richard\nShelby (R-AL), who has been unable to agree with\nDemocrats on much legislatively. In a July interview,\nCrapo called Brown “straightforward and honorable” and\nsaid that while they were far apart in terms of their\npolitical views, “the fact is we have been able to find\nsignificant areas of consensus where we can agree to\nmove forward on good policy, so I expect that we would\nbe able to do that.” The leading options for an early\nbipartisan effort include a bill providing regulatory relief\nfrom some Dodd-Frank provisions to community banks, a\nhigh priority for both Crapo and Brown. Such a bill might\ninclude language raising Dodd-Frank’s $50 billion asset\nthreshold, above which banks must submit to more\nrigorous prudential supervision by the Fed. Crapo and\nBrown also could agree on modest structural changes to\nthe Federal Reserve, unless pressure from the Trump\nWhite House for a more ambitious Fed reform bill – like\nthe package of changes passed by the House in November\n2015 – derails that effort. Crapo and Brown could also\nconceivably agree on more stringent capital standards for\nthe largest banks, a theme that Brown hammers at every\nopportunity.\nAs Shelby did, Crapo is expected to maintain the\ncommittee’s focus on rules and bodies created by the\nDodd-Frank Act, such as the Financial Stability Oversight\nCouncil (FSOC) and the Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau (CFPB), which suffered a judicial setback when a\nfederal appeals court on October 11 ruled that its\nstructure was unconstitutional. Crapo has also been\nskeptical of the new supervisory authorities the 2010 law\ngave the Fed to oversee larger banks and insurers that\nare designated as systemically important by the FSOC.\nCrapo could work collaboratively with Ranking Member\nBrown on a legislative follow-up to the Fed’s recent report\ncriticizing banks’ trading of physical commodities; one\nobvious possibility is to repeal the merchant banking\nexemption given to the holding companies for Goldman\nSachs and Morgan Stanley, as the Fed recommended.\nFinally, a post-crisis system for housing finance – i.e., the\nfuture of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – still looms as the\nbiggest area left unaddressed by the 2010 financial\nreforms, but a bipartisan effort to establish a new system\ndrafted by Crapo and then-Chairman Tim Johnson (R-SD)\nin 2013-14 foundered when the Banking Committee’s\nliberal Democrats (and some Republicans) declined to\nsupport the centrist proposal. Since then, few signs have\nemerged about how to structure a new housing finance\nsystem in a way that could survive a Senate filibuster, and\nPresident-elect Trump did not address the issue during his\ncampaign.\nHouse Financial Services Committee. After years of\nconfrontation with a Democratic White House and\nDemocratic appointees to financial regulators, Chairman\nHensarling will shift strategies now that the executive\nbranch is in more friendly hands. Hensarling is not likely\nto improve his contentious relationship with Rep. Maxine\nWaters (D-CA), however, who will return as ranking\nmember and is certain to push back on Hensarling’s\nefforts to replace the 2010 reforms with more\nconservative approaches. While Hensarling has regularly\ndone battle with officials at the FSOC, Treasury, SEC and\nthe Fed, new leadership is expected at those agencies –\nthough even Republican appointees will be constrained by\nthe existing statutory mandates in Dodd-Frank, unless the\nnew Congress is able to alter the law with legislation. At\nthe Fed, Chairman Janet Yellen’s term does not expire\nuntil January 2018. President-elect Trump frequently\ncriticized Yellen as being overly “political” during the\ncampaign.\n21\n| Election 2016\nFinancial Services\nDuring the four previous years of Hensarling’s\nchairmanship, most of the committee’s major bills died\nquietly in the Senate, such as efforts to repeal much of\nDodd-Frank (the CHOICE Act), impose substantial reforms\nupon the Fed, restructure the CFPB and strip the FSOC of\nvarious powers. That may change now that the House,\nSenate and White House will operate with greater\ncoordination, though the threat of the Senate filibuster\nlimits what Republicans can achieve. Hensarling notably\nhas enjoyed a longtime friendship with Vice Presidentelect\nMike Pence, which will give him a powerful ally in the\nWhite House as the new administration plots its strategy\nfor financial regulation and nominates key appointees for\nthe regulatory agencies. Hensarling agrees with Senators\nCrapo and Brown on the importance of capital for big\nbanks, but he wants to reward banks with relief from\nmuch of Dodd-Frank’s supervisory regime if they agree to\na higher leverage ratio. Hensarling can be expected to\nreintroduce his CHOICE Act and Rep. Bill Huizenga’s (R-\nMI) package of Fed reforms (the FORM Act), and to renew\nthe panel’s aggressive oversight of the CFPB, the FSOC\nand other bodies established by Dodd-Frank. Republicans\nhave also been critical of moves by global regulatory\nbodies to set capital and liquidity rules for “systemically\nimportant” banks and insurance companies.\nWells Fargo Scandal. Lawmakers in both the House and\nSenate are certain to resume their investigations of Wells\nFargo in the wake of revelations that the bank’s\nemployees created as many as 2 million accounts without\ncustomers’ consent. Hensarling and other Republicans\nwant to use the scandal to raise questions about the\nperformance of the CFPB and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC), while Ranking\nMember Waters has vowed to offer a bill breaking up\nWells Fargo into smaller companies. On the Senate side,\nRanking Member Brown has used the scandal to focus on\nmandatory arbitration provisions in financial contracts,\nand will likely propose legislation prohibiting such clauses,\nthough Sen. Crapo is unlikely to support him. In an\neditorial piece in October, Camden Fine, president of the\nIndependent Community Bankers of America (ICBA),\nwrote that he “fully expected” that Wells Fargo’s new\npolicy of notifying customers whenever a new account is\ncreated in their name, along with “far more stringent\npolicies, will ultimately become mandatory as\npolicymakers respond to the scandal with additional\nregulatory burdens on banks of all sizes.”\nOversight of Regulators. As they have in previous years,\nthe banking committees in 2017 will devote considerable\ntime to overseeing rules issued by financial regulators.\nThese will include the still-unfinished interagency rules for\nclawing back incentive compensation drafted by the SEC,\nthe Fed, the FDIC and other agencies; the CFPB’s\ncontroversial new rules for prepaid cards, payday lenders\nand mandatory arbitration clauses; the global Financial\nStability Board’s forthcoming regulations for capital held\nby large insurers; and the international Basel Committee’s\nrules for bank capital, which are expected to be issued by\nthe end of this year. The Banking Committee must also\nschedule hearings for high-level Treasury nominees, as\nwell as nominees for key vacancies at the SEC, CFTC, the\nFederal Reserve and the Ex-Im Bank, which were never\nfilled in the current Congress because of lingering\ndisputes with the Obama administration.\nTwo Deadlines to Watch: 1) the largest banks resubmit\ntheir “living will” resolution plans in May 2017, always a\nsource of contention for critics of “too big to fail”; 2) the\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) expires at the end of\n2017, forcing yet another ideological dispute over\nwhether the federal backstop program should be\nrenewed.\n22\n| Election 2016\nTrade\nTrade legislative issues could figure prominently in 2017.\nDuring the campaign, President-elect Trump argued\nvigorously against the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership\n(TPP), vowed to renegotiate the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA) and pledged to label China as\na currency manipulator, which could trigger the\nimposition of significant tariffs on Chinese imports.\nSenate Finance Committee. President-elect Trump may\nfind himself somewhat at odds on his trade agenda with\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Hatch who has\nsupported numerous trade agreements during his\ncongressional tenure.\nHouse Ways and Means Committee. House Republican\ntrade leaders – including Speaker Ryan and Ways and\nMeans Chairman Brady – played a pivotal role in\nadvancing President Obama’s trade initiatives through\nCongress, including passage of Trade Promotion\nAuthority (TPA) in 2015. A key question is how closely\nthey will work to support President-elect Trump’s trade\nrestrictionist agenda.\nTrans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Unless TPP can\nbe approved in the 2016 lame-duck session (an extremely\nunlikely prospect, as discussed above), TPP will not be\nratified.\nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership\nAgreement. US and EU trade negotiators failed to make\nmuch meaningful progress on TTIP in 2016. Prospects for\nTTIP are dim, given the President-elect’s trade priorities\nand a potential chill in US-EU relations.\nOther trade agreements? The Trade Promotion\nAuthority, enacted in 2015, provides enhanced fast-track\nprocedures for trade agreements reached before July 1,\n2018, with a possible extension to July 1, 2021. Will\nPresident-elect Trump decide to launch additional trade\nagreements that could be considered under the fast-track\nauthority in Congress? Following the U.K. vote on Brexit\nthis summer, some Members of Congress expressed an\ninterest in a possible US-U.K. free trade agreement.\n23\n| Election 2016\n"
