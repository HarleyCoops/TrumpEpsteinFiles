As per Peggy Siegal's office, I have included here the invitation to the IFP Gotham Awards \nceremony, which will be held on Monday, November 27 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City. \nThis year's ceremony is going to be another successful event. We couldn't be more thrilled with this year's impressive \ngroup of Tributees. The Actress Tribute will go to Nicole Kidman and the Actor Tribute to Dustin Hoffman. The Director \nTribute will be given to Sofia Coppola, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to Ed Lachman. With the Industry \nTribute, we will be honoring Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse Productions. And we simply couldn't be more pleased \nto honor Vice President Al Gore with this year's special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year ranging \nfrom Willem Dafoe, Adam Sandler and Robert Pattison to Margot Robbie, Lois Smith and Mary J. Blige, this year's \nceremony looks to be the most star studded ever. \nPlease let me know if you have any questions. \nBest regards, \nSteven \nSteven Pfeiffer \nAssociate Director, Development \nIndependent Filmmaker Project \nMade in NY Media Center by IFP \n30 John Street \nBrooklyn, NY 11201 \nwww.ifp.org  \n<image002.png> \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
