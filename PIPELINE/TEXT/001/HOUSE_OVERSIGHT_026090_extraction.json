We regret that peace is on hold due the desire of the revolutionaries to \ncontinue the war,\" he said. \nAl Makhlafi said that the government would continue to call for peace and hopes that the international \npressures and defeats that the revolutionaries have suffered until now will make them respond to the peace \nefforts. \n\"We were hoping to return again to Kuwait for the talks and our Kuwaiti brothers welcomed the return of the \ntwo delegation in Kuwait in order to sign the agreement,\" he noted. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026090 \nThe Yemeni foreign minister expressed his deep appreciation and thanks to HH the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-\nAhmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, to the Kuwait government and to HE the first deputy prime minister and foreign \nminister Sheikh Sabah Khaled al-Sabah who exerted great efforts during the Kuwait meetings. \n\"We look forward to return to Kuwait, and our brothers in Kuwait are rightly saying that we will welcome \nyou if you sign the agreement and not to waste time. But it appears that the revolutionaries are not ready to \nrespond to this step,\" he said. \nAl Meahlafi said he visited Brussels for two-days of talks with the Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders, \nEuropean Commission officials and Members of the European Parliament to explain the situation in Yemen \nand seek support for the Yemeni government's peace efforts. \nHe said the Yemeni government seeks peace based on the three references, the Gulf initiative, the outputs of \nthe national dialogue, and the Security Council resolutions on Yemen, including resolution 2216. \nThe Yemeni foreign minister called on the EU to condemn the revolution and the Iranian interference in \nYemen, which is sending arms to the Houthi militias. \nHe also expressed his thanks to the EU for their humanitarian aid and for pledging the amount of 116 million \neuro (USD 127 mn) during the UN-sponsored donors conference on Yemen held recently in Geneva.
