However, last month, the Guardian \nreported that during the second presidential debate, Donald Trump brought along four women who have \naccused Bill Clinton of sex crimes, including rape. \nThe U.K. broadsheet surmised that this was an attempt by Trump to deflect from allegations of misogyny and \nsexual misconduct by Trump himself As time has passed, the specter of billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein \nhas re-emerged. It is perhaps Clinton's relationship with Epstein that has the greatest bearing on Pizzagate. \nOn Tue, Dec 20, 2016 at 11:26 AM, Weingarten, Reid < wrote: \nYes... \nFrom: jeffrey E.
