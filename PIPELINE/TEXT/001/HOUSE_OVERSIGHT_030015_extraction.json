[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: Bill Clinton Encouraged Donald Trump to Run \nImportance: High \nFunny article \nBill Clinton reportedly had an intriguing \nphone call with Donald Trump weeks \nbefore his campaign launch \nRudolph W. Giuliani, Donald Trump, and Bill Clinton attend the 2008 Joe Torre Safe \nat Home Foundation Golf Classic at Trump National Golf Club on July 14, 2008, in \nBriarcliff Manor, New York. \nFormer President Bill Clinton and real-estate magnate Donald Trump reportedly \nhad a phone conversation in May, only weeks before Trump launched his campaign. \nAccording to a new report from The Washington Post, Clinton called Trump in May \nand \"encouraged Trump's efforts\" to become more influential within the GOP, \naccording to four \"Trump allies\" and one Clinton associate \"familiar with the \nexchange.\" \nFrom The Washington Post's Robert Costa and Anne Gearan: \n\"Four Trump allies and one Clinton associate familiar with the exchange said that \nClinton encouraged Trump's efforts to play a larger role in the Republican Party and \noffered his own views of the political landscape.\" \n\"The tone of the call was informal and Clinton never urged Trump to run, the four \npeople said. Rather, they said, Clinton sounded curious about Trump's moves \ntoward a presidential bid and told Trump that he was striking a chord with \nfrustrated conservatives and was a rising force on the right.\" \nHillary Clinton, Bill's wife, is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for \npresident in 2016. \nThe Clintons have long had ties with the real-estate magnate. As The Post notes, \nHillary Clinton attended Trump's wedding in 2005, and the reality-television \npersonality donated money to her past Senate campaigns, though he has also \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030015 \ndonated to several of his own Republican presidential rivals. He has said \nthose donations were transactional. \nThe former president has spoken positively of Trump in the past. \nIn a 2012 interview with CNN, Clinton said he liked Trump, despite the real-estate \nmogul's controversial campaign to get President Barack Obama to release his birth \ncertificate. \n\"Donald Trump has been uncommonly nice to Hillary and me. We're all New \nYorkers,\" Clinton said. \"I like him. And I love playing golf with him.\" \nAides to both Bill Clinton and Trump did not comment on record to The Post. \nHillary Clinton's campaign also didn't respond to a request for comment. \nBill Clinton has occasionally doled out advice to Republican presidential candidates. \nIn 2012, Clinton reportedly gave former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) some \ntips before his successful debate with President Barack Obama, telling the governor \nhow to appear in command onstage. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030016 \n"
