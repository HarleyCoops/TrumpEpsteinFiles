More balanced approach needed but\nlook for another leg to cyclical trades.\n• O/w Media as quality cyclical and Oil.

We see a return to positive EPS\ngrowth (+7%) in Europe for the first time since 2014, driven by higher global GDP\ngrowth Resources recovery, capex discipline and FX. +7% growth implies less\ndowngrades than usual (10% is the average).

Recovery (we look a\nmodest acceleration in both growth and inflation) and Rotation go hand in hand. On the\nbasis of our central forecasts for growth, inflation and rates and given the moves in the\nmarket already we think that the pace of the rotation has to moderate. (In-line with that\nwe recently downgraded of banks and miners).\nReversal refers to the ECB. Our economists are not yet convinced that the ECB will\nstart to unwind loose policy 2017 but the probability is increasing. An ECB that tapers\nbecause growth and inflation are improving would be supportive for markets, notably\nbanks. But tapering because the ability or willingness to do QE fades would likely cause\na setback. Relief or Revolt relates to European politics. Will Europe follow the route to\npopulism (revolt from the voters) or will we find relief for the markets by the end of\n2017 from a Fillon/Merkel duo being in charge of the Euro area’s two largest\neconomies. We think investors will demand a higher risk premium until the French\nElections in May 2017\nValuation are reasonable at 14x PE but Europe is cheap on a relative basis and the\nvaluation overhang remains evident in the region’s equity risk premium, which\nimplies 11% upside to get back to 5-year average levels. We see a return to positive\nEPS growth (+7%) in Europe for the first time since 2014, as 3.5% global GDP growth\nshould deliver positive earnings growth (supported by Resources recovery, capex\ndiscipline and FX. +7% growth implies less downgrades than usual (10% is the average).\nBond yields and equities – stable/higher inflation breakevens are key. Equities can\ncontinue to perform in an environment of higher rates – the key is that inflation\nbreakevens are not falling. However, a more aggressive bond sell-off taking Treasury\nyields to 3% or higher would undermine EM, the growth outlook and risky assets.\nThe rotation out of bond proxies and Defensives into Financials and Cyclicals has\nmoved to extreme levels: relative performance of Financials / Cyclicals versus\nDefensives rose over 6SD in 10-14 months. Technical metrics are at historical extremes,\narguing for a moderation in relative returns and a more balanced approach to sector\nallocation is justified right now. Look for another leg to cyclical trades in the New Year.\nSectors have also moved a long way already from a valuation perspective.\nFinancials are now trading around median relative valuation levels. Healthcare PE\nrelative is at the bottom of the historical range and Utilities relative PE is also close to\nthe prior low hit in 2013. Food & Beverage still commands a large premium and PErelative\nis 6-10% above the 2010 / 2014 lows.\nWe remain cautious on domestic UK exposure. The full impact of sterling weakness\non the UK consumer environment is yet to be felt and Brexit negotiations are likely to\ndrive further uncertainty and FX volatility in our view. Structural issues add to our\nconcerns in Retail and Travel & Leisure (both underweight).\nOverweight Oil, Healthcare, Utilities, Media; underweight Food & Beverage. If OPEC\ncuts production and oil recovers up to the high $50s per barrel, Oil sector EPS and cash\nflows can recover significantly and make the highest DY in market (6%) look sustainable.\nHealthcare we believe is too cheap relative to an improving sector growth outlook. 2017\nwill be an important year for newsflow on key pipeline drugs. Evidence of success can\ndrive a re-rating independent of macro. Despite the recent sell-off, among defensives\nand bond proxies Food & Beverage still seems the least attractive. Valuations are among\nthe most expensive in the market and overweight positioning has not corrected\nmaterially yet. We move overweight Media, a wuality cyclical that has lagged badly and\nseen valuations de-rate.\n2 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nKey charts\nChart 1: Synchronised rise in leading indicators globally augurs well for\nearnings recovery – especially if PMIs kick on to or above mid-50s\n65\n60\n55\n50\n45\n40\n35\nISM / Euro PMI manuf avg (advanced 9m)\n30\nMSCI Europe EPS € (trailing yoy, RHS)\n01/98 01/01 01/04 01/07 01/10 01/13 01/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\n60\n40\n20\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\nChart 2: Modestly higher yields and higher equities compatible – Rising\ninflation breakevens the key for equities\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\nStoxx 600 4-week returns vs 4-week change in real\nyields / inflation breakevens (since 2009)\nBund real >+0, b/even +ve\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nBund real >+0, b/even -ve\nChart 3: Cyclicals vs Defensives trade now looks very stretched\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\nDec-97 Dec-01 Dec-05 Dec-09 Dec-13\nCyclicals vs Defensives - relative price vs 52wk average (SD)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nChart 5: Financials valuations have recovered significantly relative to\nthe move in bond yields – relative PE back around average levels\n0.90\n3.5\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n0.65\nBanks / Insurance PE-rel\n0.60\nGerman 10y (RHS)\n01/10 01/11 01/12 01/13 01/14 01/15 01/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\nChart 4: Likewise Financials vs Defensives: -2.5SD to +2.5SD post-Brexit\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\nDec-97 Dec-01 Dec-05 Dec-09 Dec-13\nFinancials vs Defensives - relative price vs 52wk average (SD)\nSource: Re BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg place this text\nChart 6: Rapid relative de-rating for Staples – relative PE for Food &\nBeverage still 6-10% above 2010 / 2014 levels\n1.70\n-1\n1.60\n1.50\n1.40\n1.30\n1.20\nPE-relative FOOD & BEV\n1.10\nGerman 10y (RHS, inverted)\n01/10 01/11 01/12 01/13 01/14 01/15 01/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 3\nLessons from 2016\nThe old joke is that Year Aheads are frequently out of date by the end of year they are\nwritten in. There is a real danger of that this year given the speed which things have\nmoved since Brexit and more recently the US election. The two charts below show that\nFinancials and Cyclicals have clawed back around 2/3 of their underperformance vs\nDefensives. Of course it depends how you frame the question since we have included\nUtilities and Telecoms in the defensive basket. But when we downgraded Banks 10 days\nor so ago they had outperformed Food and Beverage by ~50% since the lows of early\nJuly. Whichever way you cut it some of these moves have been extreme.\nChart 7: The moves since Brexit in both Financials…\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n0.65\n0.60\n0.55\n0.50\nFinancials vs Defensives relative\n0.45\n01/10 01/11 01/12 01/13 01/14 01/15 01/16\nSource: Bloomberg\nChart 8: …and Cyclicals relative to Defensives has been dramatic\n1.45\n1.35\n1.25\n1.15\n1.05\n0.95\nCyclicals vs Defensives relative\n0.85\n0.75\n01/10 01/11 01/12 01/13 01/14 01/15 01/16\nSource: Bloomberg\nMoreover, in 2016 we doubt that even if investors had known the results of key events\nthat they would necessarily have got the reaction in markets right. As we joked in our\nCross Asset year ahead you needed not so much a crystal ball as a time machine to have\ngot things completely right this year. Aside from Brexit and Donald Trump winning the\nUS election it is easy to forget that in February we were worrying about a US recession\nand deflation. US 5Y5Y forward breakeven inflation rates actually troughed at 1.8% at\nthat point. Four months later we were worrying about the deflationary impact of Brexit.\nNow we are thinking about the reflation under a Trump Presidency.\nChart 9: US 5Y5Y forward inflation troughed in February\n3.3\n3.1\n2.9\n2.7\n2.5\n2.3\n2.1\n1.9\nUS 5y5y fwd inflation swap\n1.7\nChart 10: At the same time as Basic Resources\n1.7\nStoxx Basic Resources Price Relative\n1.5\n1.3\n1.1\n0.9\n0.7\n0.5\nDec-12\nMar-13\nJun-13\nSep-13\nDec-13\nMar-14\nJun-14\nSep-14\nDec-14\nMar-15\nJun-15\nSep-15\nDec-15\nMar-16\nJun-16\nSep-16\nSource: Bloomberg\nSource: Bloomberg\nThe panic in markets in early February actually presented a perfect buying opportunity\nfor reflationary assets. Miners was a sector truly loathed by investors of all colours at\nthe start of the year with many thinking that some of the big players might even go\nbust. If there is one key conclusion from all of this it is do not tie yourself to a view. We\n4 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nwere underweight at the start of the year too and missed the lows. We recognized we\nwere wrong and closed our underweight and while it took us a while but we eventually\nmanaged to go overweight in September. The lesson of that is that themes are great,\nbut when the facts change strategists and investors have to change their minds.\nChart 11: Cyclicals vs Defensives: from -3.5SD to +3.2SD in 14 months\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\nDec-97 Dec-01 Dec-05 Dec-09 Dec-13\nCyclicals vs Defensives - relative price vs 52wk average (SD)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nChart 12: Financials vs Defensives: -2.5SD to +2.5SD post Brexit\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\nDec-97 Dec-01 Dec-05 Dec-09 Dec-13\nFinancials vs Defensives - relative price vs 52wk average (SD)\nSource: Re BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg place this text\nIn fact your best guide to this year was to buy something when it has oversold,\nunderowned and unloved, like Miners and Emerging Markets in February, Banks in July,\nthe Nikkei the day of the US election and sell when the opposite e.g. bonds and\ndefensive equities shortly after Brexit. Our CTI models did actually pick up a number of\nthose events as the table below shows. It also got picked up by our standard deviation\nanalysis. We acted on some but not all of these readings. The lesson, with the benefit of\nhindsight, is to pay more attention to them. Indeed, our recent decision to downgrade\nboth Banks and Basic Resources reflected very high readings on our models.\nTable 1: Reflation rotation very stretched on our CTIs post-Trump\nAsset 11/11/2016 10/11/2016 09/11/2016\nEUR/GBP -46 -44 -12\nGerman 10y Bonds 66 61 24\nUS 10y Bonds 96 96 93\nStoxx Banks 80 71 0\nStoxx Basic Resources 92 93 92\nStoxx Food & Beverages -84 -96 -54\nStoxx Insurance 67 64 23\nStoxx Personal & Household Goods -34 -75 -7\nStoxx Utilities -92 -94 -19\nRelative CTI\nRelative Stoxx Banks 86 87 50\nRelative Stoxx Basic Resources 100 100 99\nRelative Stoxx Food & Beverages -93 -93 -89\nRelative Stoxx Insurance 92 91 76\nRelative Stoxx Media -34 -77 -87\nRelative Stoxx Pers&Hhold Goods -92 -94 -75\nRelative Stoxx Technology -80 -74 -55\nRelative Stoxx Telecom -91 -92 -28\nRelative Stoxx Utilities -82 -92 -59\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nTable 2: While opposite true immediately post-Brexit\nAsset 29/06/2016 28/06/2016 27/06/2016\nRelative Stoxx Autos -95 -39 -9\nRelative Stoxx Banks -80 -83 -86\nRelative Stoxx Basic Resources 21 3 0\nRelative Stoxx Chemicals 2 19 40\nRelative Stoxx Construction & Materials -10 -36 -71\nRelative Stoxx Financial Services -91 -91 -92\nRelative Stoxx Food & Beverages 60 78 82\nRelative Stoxx Healthcare 88 88 88\nRelative Stoxx Industrial Goods &\nServices\n-47 -35 -44\nRelative Stoxx Insurance -87 -94 -94\nRelative Stoxx Media -6 -13 -35\nRelative Stoxx Oil & Gas 93 86 91\nRelative Stoxx Personal & Household\nGoods\n57 58 70\nRelative Stoxx Retail -63 -81 -75\nRelative Stoxx Technology 0 0 0\nRelative Stoxx Telecom 3 0 -16\nRelative Stoxx Travel & Leisure -98 -100 -100\nRelative Stoxx Utilities 65 6 2\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nWe think 2017 is another year where investors will need to be nimble. Markets have\nresponded enthusiastically to a prospective Trump Presidency but as the above charts\nsuggest we may well have discounted much of it. That is also supported by our fixed\nincome and FX forecasts, which suggest much has already been priced in. In addition we\nhave political risk starting with next weekend’s Italian referendum stretching to the\nGerman elections in Autumn 2017. In the middle we have the crucial French elections. A\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 5\nMarine Le Pen victory could bring into question both the future of the EU and also the\neuro, should the polls be close it could make the uncertainty and market moves around\nBrexit look like a walk in the park.\n2017 – Reflation, Reversal, Rotation, Relief or Revolt?\n2017 is likely to have a number of cross currents as themes. Recovery and Rotation go\nhand in hand. The stronger the recovery the more yields can rise the more we can see\nthe rotation extend. Should investors become concerned that the recovery is stalling or\nthat yields are peaking the rotation would likely stall potentially even reverse. Reversal\nrefers to the ECB. Our economists are not yet convinced that the ECB will start to\nunravel some of its easing measures in 2017 but they do expect the debate to be a\nvigorous one within the ECB. For the first time Gilles Moec thinks there is a chance that\nthe ECB will indeed choose to taper. Relief or Revolt relates to the French election. Will\nEurope follow the UK and US lead of 2016 and go down the route of populism (revolt\nfrom the voters) or will we find relief for the markets if by the end of 2017 from a\nFillon/Merkel duo being in charge of the two largest economies in the Euro Area.\nRecovery – the world looks a better place going into 2017\nReflation has been the big theme of the second half of the year. As we had noted in\nprevious publications there had been something of an improvement in the global growth\npicture emerging even before the US election. It started with Emerging Market growth,\nwhich our GEMScycle has been showing to be accelerating for some months, but seems\nto have spread to other parts of the developing world. US GDP for Q3 has just printed a\nrevised 3.2%, with a number of indicators, such as ISM’s, PMI’s and consumer\nconfidence pointing to a solid Q4 to follow. That quarter is currently tracking at 3.6%\naccording to the Atlanta Fed.\nChart 13: Eurozone PMI’s have picked up of late…\n60.0\n55.0\n50.0\n45.0\n40.0\nEA Services PMI EA Manufacturing PMI\nAug-09 Aug-10 Aug-11 Aug-12 Aug-13 Aug-14 Aug-15 Aug-16\nSource: Markit\nChart 14: US Consumer Confidence now at post-GFC highs\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\nSource: Bloomberg\nUS Consumer Confidence…\nJan-05\nJul-05\nJan-06\nJul-06\nJan-07\nJul-07\nJan-08\nJul-08\nJan-09\nJul-09\nJan-10\nJul-10\nJan-11\nJul-11\nJan-12\nJul-12\nJan-13\nJul-13\nJan-14\nJul-14\nJan-15\nJul-15\nJan-16\nJul-16\nThe Euro Area too is showing signs of improvement with the latest manufacturing PMIs\nback to their best since early 2014 with other national surveys, such as Ifo pointing in\nthe same direction. The composite PMI is back close to the year highs too. The UK\nnumbers continue to surprise on the upside too for the moment. Our economists are\nalso upbeat on Japan with growth expected to accelerate next year as the fiscal stimulus\nkicks in.\nAccordingly our economists expect growth to rise from 3% this year to 3.5% in 2017\nand 3.8% in 2018. That acceleration in growth is despite a slightly slower US economy\nin the first half of the year as a higher USD and interest rates dampen growth before\nthe fiscal stimulus kicks in. With growth firming and oil prices expected to be higher\ninflation is also expected to pick up through 2017 and 2018 to 2.8% and 3%\nrespectively. At this stage it is worth noting that this is a modest acceleration in both\ngrowth and inflation.\n6 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nThe Fed is accordingly expected to proceed cautiously at least initially. In part for that\nreason our fixed income and FX strategists have only a modest further increase in bond\nyields and the USD in their forecasts for next year. They project 10Y US Treasuries\nrising to 2.65% and the USD to 1.02 vs the EUR. The dollar is expected to strengthen\nmore aggressively against both the GBP and the JPY, but even so the gain in the\ncurrency overall has been frontloaded into 2016.\nOur economists and strategists are cautious partly because the fiscal stimulus is\nexpected to have only a modest impact on growth, at around 0.5% of GDP. That is based\non the assumption that some of the proposals will get watered down and that the tax\ncuts have a relatively low fiscal multiplier. Our US economists think that should the\nfiscal stimulus be larger and more effective (for which read more infrastructure) then\nUS growth could surprise on the upside to around 3% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018. That in\nturn would mean a more aggressive Fed and in all likelihood a bigger rise in yields and\nthe USD.\nChart 15: BofAML sees GDP accelerating into 2018…\nGlobal GDP growth % DM GDP growth % EM GDP growth %\n4.7\n5.1\n3.2\n4.1\n3.1\n4.1\n3.5\n3.8\n2.1\n1.5\n1.7\n1.9\nChart 16: …with inflation picking up too\nGlobal CPI inflation % DM CPI inflation % EM CPI inflation %\n4.2\n3.6 3.6\n3.8\n2.5 2.4\n2.8\n3\n1.7 1.8\n0.7\n0.3\n2015 2016F 2017F 2018F\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n2015 2016F 2017F 2018F\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nReversal: There is good taper and bad taper\nThe outcome of that would likely affect ECB behaviour too. Our central expectation is\nfor Euro Area growth of around 1 ½% and inflation nudging only modestly higher. A\nmuch more robust global economy and a stronger USD (presumably weaker EUR) would\nlikely put upward pressure on both of those. Indeed, in such an environment it is not\nimpossible to think of 10Y Treasuries pushing through 3% and the USD breaking parity\nagainst the EUR.\nThat in turn would increase the pressure on the ECB to start to reverse its very loose\nmonetary policy stance. Tapering would then become much more likely. It would likely\npush European bond yields higher too, certainly above the 65bp forecast for Bund yields\nat the end of 2017.\nAn ECB that tapers because growth and inflation are improving would not be a bad thing\nfor markets. Frankly for some parts of the market, notably banks, anything which gets\nthe ECB away from its current policy stance back towards normality is a positive.\nIndeed, the prospect of negative interest rates being reversed is the kind of thing which\nAlastair Ryan (our banks strategist) lies awake at night dreaming of ( see European\nBanks Strategy: repressed).\nBut and it is a big but, if the ECB chooses to taper because it is running out of options\nor the ability to do QE that is not a good thing. Some of the hawks on the ECB would\nchoose to taper at the first opportunity because they never really liked the idea of QE in\nthe first place. A tapering at next week’s meeting even if it is couched in terms of doing\nless for longer would not be good news for equity markets.\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 7\nRotation – more to go but it has to be more gradual\nOn the basis of our central forecasts for growth, inflation and rates and given the moves\nin the market already we think that the pace of the rotation has to moderate. After all if\nwe are to see another 30-40 bp of yield increase in the US between now and H2 2017\nhaving already seen more than 90bp since the summer, it has to slow.\nThat view combined with the readings from our models lay behind our recent\ndowngrades of banks and miners. That is not to say that the rotation is finished. If bond\nyields truly have turned than some of the more expensive defensives likely have to derate\nfurther. The bull market in those stocks has simply lasted too long for that not to be\nthe case.\nIn addition while there have been significant moves in positioning in terms of cutting\nunderweights in areas like Banks and Basic Resources and hedge fund positioning has\nprobably moved faster still, we do not believe that positioning has completely turned\naround. Looking at both the Fund Manager Survey and our own internal data we think\nthere are still legacy underweights in cyclical areas and legacy overweights in\ndefensives, particularly quality defensives. That argues for another leg in the rotation\ntrade.\nNevertheless, it suggests to us that a more balanced approach is justified right now. We\nare still overweight oil, but little else in the cyclical space, so today we add Media. We\nare still underweight Food & Beverage but against that we are overweight Healthcare\nand Utilities.\nRelief or revolt – Eurozone politics in focus in 2017\nWe think it likely investors will demand a higher risk premium until the French Elections\nin May 2017 given the likelihood that Marine Le Pen will make to the second round of\nvoting (according to polls). A Le Pen victory could likely bring the future of the EU and\nthe Euro into question as she has talked about France withdrawing from both. That in\nturn has arguably the potential to be even more of an earthquake for the world’s\nfinancial markets. Our central case is that centre right President is elected in France\n(with Francois Fillon now the official Republican candidate) and Merkel is returned at the\nhead of a coalition government in Germany now that she has indicated she will stand for\nre-election. Until the French vote though we suspect investors will be cautious about\nEuropean markets. Were this to be the case then we think there may well be room for a\nsignificant relief rally in European assets. We have more on this, including a calendar, in\nour section on Eurozone politics.\nDecent valuations but not compelling\nHeadline PE multiples do not screen as particularly cheap for European equities but are\nalso not excessively expensive. In fact the current forward PE on MSCI Europe at 14.1x\nis right in-line with the average since 1987. The most recent high in PE multiples was\nover 16.5x at the April 2015 market highs. However, more recently the market has\ntraded in a fairly tight range around 14-15.5x PE, with some fleeting falls to 13x around\nthe market lows in February 2016 and at the time of the Brexit referendum. At the\ncurrent multiple we see valuations as quite reasonable therefore. Our index target\nassumes some multiple expansion back to 15x, which we think is quite achievable under\nour base case assumptions.\n8 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nChart 17: MSCI Europe forward PE in-line with 30-year average at\n14.1x…\n30\nMSCI Europe PE 12m fwd\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n12/87 12/91 12/95 12/99 12/03 12/07 12/11 12/15\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\nChart 18: …but at lower end of 13-15.5x PE range of last 15 months\n17.0\n16.0\n15.0\n14.0\n13.0\nMSCI Europe PE 12m fwd\n12.0\n01/14 07/14 01/15 07/15 01/16 07/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\nRelative attractiveness of Europe depends on EPS recovery in medium-term.\nMoving to relative valuations, European equities screen somewhat cheap vs their DM\npeers. However, the medium-term bull case for Europe is far more a function of\npotential earnings and ROE recovery rather than significant undervaluation. Europe’s\nvaluation discount to the US is at multi decade wides on PBV (over 40%) but that in turn\nreflects Europe’s significant underperformance on EPS growth and ROE. Trailing ROE\nfor MSCI Europe is just 8% (at historical trough levels). That is nearly 5pp below MSCI\nUSA compared to a 3pp gap on average historically and close to the widest spreads\nsince the mid-1990s.\nEurope vs US relative PE 7% below average. Based on PE, Europe nevertheless trades\ncheap relative to the US. The PE discount at 18% is 7% wider than the 20 year average\nand relative PE is at the lowest level since 2012. So while a sustained reversal in the\nunderperformance of Europe versus the US would over time have to be driven by a\nrecovery in relative profitability we do see current valuations reflecting a discount\nperhaps for political reasons (Brexit, upcoming elections).\nChart 19: Europe vs US: modest PE discount but cheap on rel.

The model assumes the cost of\nequity is simply the cyclically adjusted earnings yield (calculated using a 5 year centred\naverage EPS). We then compare this number to the German bund yield to estimate the\nimplied equity risk premium (ERP).\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 9\nEurope’s ERP on our model is 6.9% – down from the post-Brexit highs at 7.5% but still\nat a 70bp premium to the 3 and 5 year average for the ERP. That in turn implies a ~11%\nvaluation haircut relative to 5-year average levels.\nThese numbers also show that the recent rise in bond yields is modest relative to where\ncost of equity or ERP sits. We're quite far away from the level that bond yields would\nmake ERP look expensive. Even with bund yields at 75bp (ie +50bp from here) it would\nonly shift the ERP back to average levels (all else equal). Bond yields need to rise 150-\n200bp to get to the expensive end of the range of last 6 years on ERP.\nChart 21: Implied cost of equity (CoE) on our model in Europe is 6.9%, a\nlittle below the average since 1988 (7.2%) and last 10 years (8.4%).\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\nChart 22: Implied equity risk premium remains elevated: 6.7% ERP to\nbund yields vs 10-year average of 6.2% and recent high of 7.3%.\n12\n10\n8\n6\n6\n4\n2\nImplied cost of equity (%)\n4\n2\nEquity Risk Premium (vs 10y Bund)\n0\n01/88 01/91 01/94 01/97 01/00 01/03 01/06 01/09 01/12 01/15\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, MSCI, IBES\n0\n10/06 09/08 08/10 08/12 07/14 06/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, MSCI, IBES\nEurope cost of equity higher than long-run average compared to US. Europe also\ncompares favourably on a relative basis against the US equity market in this framework.\nThe implied CoE for the S&P500 on an equivalent model is 5.64%, which is now at an\n11-year low and 130bp below the 10-year average. The implied ERP on that basis at\n3.3% is also below average and not far off the lows from the past 10 years. Admittedly\nEurope did get significantly cheaper relative to the US during the GFC and the sovereign\ndebt crisis. The cost of equity premium for MSCI Europe vs the S&P is 1.21%. That is a\npremium to the 30-year average of 0.72%. However it is below the average of the past\n10 years – the spread peaked at over 4% in 2008 and at 2.7% in 2011 / 2012.\nChart 23: Implied equity risk premium near 9-year lows in the US\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\nS&P Equity Risk Premium (vs 10y UST)\n1\n0\n10/06 09/08 08/10 08/12 07/14 06/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, MSCI, IBES\nChart 24: Europe vs US implied cost of equity spread\n5\nCost of equity spread Europe vs S&P\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n01/90 01/93 01/96 01/99 01/02 01/05 01/08 01/11 01/14\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, MSCI, IBES\n10 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nEarnings – a return to positive EPS growth\nin 2017\n7% EPS growth in 2017 as global growth improves and Resources EPS recovers\nWe think the earnings backdrop will be supportive in 2017 with a return to positive EPS\ngrowth in Europe for the first time since 2014 and with downside to consensus\nforecasts for the year ahead that are well below average. Our base case assumes +7%\nEPS growth in 2017 and 2018. With EPS broadly stagnant over the last 6 years,\ninvestors might justifiably ask what is different this time.

First, global\ngrowth is accelerating and on our economists’ base case forecasts global GDP growth\nwill be 3.5%, the first materially above trend growth year since 2010. That is significant\nfor European earnings given a reasonably tight relationship to global GDP growth. 3%\nrepresents the tipping point around which earnings growth tends to turn positive\naccording to our regression model. At the BofAML forecast of 3.5% global GDP growth,\n7% EPS growth is implied as likely by the same model.\n…as leading indicators point to a synchronized global recovery. What gives us\nconfidence in this putative earnings recovery is the more synchronized nature of the\ncurrent recovery. All major regions of the world are showing momentum in growth\nindicators for the first time in several years. One measure of the broad nature of the\nimprovement is manufacturing PMI surveys. Of 29 Markit PMIs 83% are currently above\n50, highest since August 2014. More importantly, 79% have improved over the last 3\nmonths – higher than at any point in the last three years.\nBull case of global GDP towards 4% would signal double digit EPS growth. To see a\nmore bullish outcome for EPS we would need to see global GDP accelerating further. Based\non our regression model, double digit EPS growth historically was consistent with global GDP\ngrowth above 3.8%. Under our bull case scenario for 2017, with say 4.0% global GDP growth,\nconsensus EPS growth forecasts for +14% in Europe would become realistic.\nPMIs beyond 55 would suggest upside to base case. Significant further gains in\nleading indicators would be a signal that earnings growth could exceed our base case.\nOver the longer term EPS growth has followed manufacturing PMI surveys with a 9-\nmonth lag approximately (using an average of US and Eurozone). Historically readings\nabove 55 were consistent with mid-teens EPS growth. The relationship has weakened in\nrecent years as low interest rates and weaker commodity prices weighed on earnings in\nFinancials and Resources. Nevertheless, in the last year of decent EPS growth in Europe\nin 2014 the PMIs peaked at 54 so we would look for upside to our base case EPS\nforecast should PMIs improve to the mid-50s level or beyond.\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 11\nChart 27: 3% Global GDP growth the tipping point for EPS\nEurope trailing EPS growth vs World GDP\n50%\n7%\n40%\n6%\n30%\n20%\n5%\n10%\n4%\n0%\n3%\n-10%\n2%\n-20%\n-30%\n1%\n-40%\n0%\n-50%\n-1%\nQ496 Q499 Q402 Q405 Q408 Q411 Q414 Q417\nMSCI Europe 12m trail EPS (IBES) World GDP (right)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\nChart 28: Synchronised rise in leading indicators globally augurs well for\nearnings recovery – especially if PMIs kick on to or above mid-50s\n65\n60\n55\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n01/98 01/01 01/04 01/07 01/10 01/13 01/16\nISM / Euro PMI manuf avg (advanced 9m)\nMSCI Europe EPS € (trailing yoy, RHS)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\n60\n40\n20\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\nRemoval of the 3pp p.a. drag from Resources supports EPS outlook. Second, the\nResources sectors in 2017 will likely provide a (strongly) positive contribution to market\nEPS, in turn reversing what has been the biggest headwind for several years. Over the\nlast 3-5 years the Resources sectors provided a 2.5 percentage point drag on annualized\nmarket EPS growth. In 2016 Banks have been the other big drag on market earnings.\nWhile structural headwinds to profitability mean the contribution of Banks remains open\nto debate, consensus forecasts nevertheless imply a strong recovery in 2017 (driven in\npart by one-offs reversing). The important point is that the market ex-Banks and\nResources has delivered modest but positive EPS growth – estimated at +5.5% for\n2016. Hence, removing the drag from Oil and Mining makes high single digit growth\nachievable in our view.\nChart 29: Resources a 2.5pp drag on market EPS growth in recent years\nAnnualized EPS growth\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n3yr 5yr 10yr\nChart 30: Capex discipline supportive to margin outlook\nEurope Ex-Financials: EBIT margins vs capex/depreciation\n14%\n12%\n10%\n8%\n6%\n100%\n120%\n140%\n160%\n-1\n-2\nStoxx 600 Market Ex-Resources Market Ex-Banks &\nResources\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\n4%\n1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 2018\nEBIT / sales (LS, %)\nForecast EBIT / sales (LS, %)\nCapex/depreciation - 2yma pushed 2y fwd (RS, %)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Factset\n180%\nMargin upside, capex discipline and FX tailwind provide additional support.

Hence, for now we don’t see the prospect of a sustained upgrade cycle.\nConsensus downgrades are the norm however. 2010 was the last year that consensus\nforecasts started the year too low. In fact, consensus was too high in 12 of the last 17\nyears. Moreover, our estimate of 7% EPS growth in 2017 implies less downgrades than\nusual (10% is the average). It’s also worth noting that over the past 17 years annual\nconsensus downgrades of less than 10% have never been accompanied by negative\nequity returns for the same calendar year.\nSector EPS growth prospects\nCorrelation analysis of sector earnings growth against global GDP suggests that Banks are\nthe sector that may be most sensitive to improvements in global economy. Interest rate\ndevelopments are likely the key to earnings but they in turn should reflect the nominal\ngrowth environment. Real economic growth would also have some effect on credit volumes\nand collateral valuations though, reinforcing the link from the economy to Bank earnings.\nCyclicals unsurprisingly dominate the other sectors with EPS growth geared to global\ngrowth. Basic Resources, Chemicals, Tech and Industrials all exhibit a correlation above\n70%. Some other cyclicals including Autos and Construction have been had much less\ncorrelated EPS growth to global GDP in recent years. In part that reflects that significant\nearnings volatility in the period analysed. What’s notable for both groups is that\nexpectations already look high for both sectors. Consensus estimates also factor in a\nrebound in Resources sector EPS growth – but both these sectors have seen the largest\nearnings declines over the past five years. Forecasts look more restrained in Industrials,\nChemicals, Tech – implying mid to high single digit growth in the coming three years.\nAmong Defensives expectations look highest in Telecoms – suggesting 10% average\nEPS growth in 2016-18 despite the weak trend rate for sector earnings in recent years.\nConsensus forecasts imply a more modest improvement for Utilities – with just 1% EPS\nCAGR for 2016-18. Staples and Healthcare are forecast to have high single digit EPS\ngrowth in the coming 3 years, implying 2-3pp improvements in the annual growth rate\nrelative the trailing 5-year average for Staples and +6pp for Healthcare.\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 13\nChart 33: Correlation of sector EPS to global GDP since 2010\nBANKS\nBASIC RESOURCE\nREALSTATE\nCHEMICALS\nRETAIL\nTECHNOLOGY\nINDS GDS & SVS\nHEALTH CARE\nPERS & H/H GDS\nTELECOM\nFOOD & BEV\nOIL & GAS\nTRAVEL & LEIS\nINSURANCE\nMEDIA\nAUTO & PARTS\nFINANCIAL SVS\nCON & MAT\nUTILITIES\n-20% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\nChart 34: Trailing vs forward EPS CAGR – ranked by difference\nBasic Resources\nOil & Gas\nTelecom\nConstruction & Materials\nRetail\nAuto & Parts\nStoxx 600\nBanks\nMedia\nUtilities\nIndustrial Goods & Sevices\nHealthCare\nChemicals\nReal estate\nFood & Bev\nTechnology\nPersonal & Household goods\nInsurance\nFinancial Services\nTravel & Leisure\n5yr\nTrailing\nCAGR\n3yr Fwd\nCAGR\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20\nEarnings revisions trends.

BTPs and the banks\nrecaps remain a tail risks for the Italian economy, although the ECB extending QE\nshould help. A big “No” vote would boost Five Star and undermine Renzi into 2018\nelections, in our view.\n4 December: Austrian presidential election\nPolls by public broadcaster ORF show the result as very close. Norbert Hofer is\nstanding on an anti-immigrant platform against the moderate former Green leader\nAlexander Van der Bellen in a rerun of the May vote. The election of Freedom party\ncandidate Norbert Hofer would make Austria the first nation to elect a head of state\nrunning on a far right platform since the EU began.\n22/ 29 Jan: French Socialist Party presidential nominee elections\nIf President François Hollande decides to run for re-election as the Socialist Party\ncandidate (decision expected Dec 10th) he could be challenged by former Prime\nMinister Manuel Valls and Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg. Current second\nround polls for any combination of these candidates suggest likely Socialist nominee\ntoo close to call.\n15 March 2017: Dutch elections\nPrime Minister Mark Rutte currently leads a “purple” coalition with the Dutch Labour\nparty as main second party. But the latest polls suggest both parties could win fewer\nseats than they have now in 2017. That could make it more challenging to build a\ngovernment given the need to secure at least 76/150 seats. In terms of who could\nlead that coalition, polls have Rutte’s People’s Party neck and neck with the antiimmigrant\nFreedom party led by populist Geert Wilders. Wilders has called for the\nNetherlands to leave the EU indicated he would call a referendum if elected. A\nWilder-Rutte coalition also hasn’t been ruled out according to press reports.\n23 April: French first round presidential elections\nThe first round of voting for the next French president will be on 23 April. First\nround polling suggests the leader of the anti-EU Front National Marine Le Pen is\nexpected to progress to the decisive runoff. At present Republican Candidate\nFrancois Fillon is also expected to make it through.\n7 May 2017: French second round presidential elections\nCurrent polls, albeit their validity has been called into question by events in 2016,\nshow Fillon securing 65-70% of the vote vs Le Pen in a runoff (see chart below). We\nnote that when her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, faced Jacques Chirac in the 2002\nPresidential elections the FN candidate only received 18% of the vote. Nevertheless,\nwe see a potential Le Pen win as the biggest political risk event for European (and\npossibly global) equity markets in 2017.\nBy 22 October 2017: German Federal elections\nCurrent Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced that she intends to stand for reelection.\nCurrent polls have Merkel’s CDU ahead followed by SDP with the eurosceptic\nAlternative für Deutschland, Greens and Die Linke competing for third spot.\nWhile it may be necessary for Merkel to maintain the grand coalition with the SDP,\nour central case is that we see a continuation of the current German administration\nand that German elections carry less risk than the earlier French presidential\nelections.\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 15\nPolitics – populism in the Eurozone?\nFew predicted that the UK would vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump would win the\nUS presidential election in 2016, least of all pollsters (and many in markets). As Michael\nHartnett argues, the rise of populism can be linked to what he refers to as Peak\nInequality and Peak Globalisation. Trump and the Brexit campaign tapped into deep\napathy with the socio-economic order that for them remains unreformed post-GFC.\nThat’s why the poster boy for this dislocation is often the blue collar voter whose\nstandards of living have not been rising in the increasingly globalised world. The crucial\nquestion for investors as we enter a busy year for European politics (see table opposite)\nis whether the populism train will gather pace or terminate at the Eurozone.\nItaly risks elevated, but risks two way and banks the bigger issue\nAlthough Italy goes to the polls this year, it is worthwhile starting with this Sunday’s\nvote. In Strategy Insights: Italy risks elevated we argue that our base case is a narrow\nrejection of the proposed constitutional reform, which is another vote against governing\nparty on Dec 4. But unlike UK/ US, this would be expected and Renzi is likely to stay on\nso the outcome should not carry the same surprise or uncertainty factor for markets.\nThe tail risk are also two way. A large “No” vote could perceived as supportive of the 5\nstar movement but a “Yes” vote would be bullish Italy and risk assets more generally.\nThe bigger issue is likely recapitalisation of the Italian banks. This remains a significant\ntail risk for banks and was part of why we downgraded the sector.\nA Le Pen victory could prove the biggest risk to European markets in 2017\nProbably the most natural fit for the populism theme in 2017 is the French presidential\nelection. Although polls have been somewhat discredited by events this year they\nremain useful as an indication of where the public mood lies. With that caveat in mind,\ncurrent voting intentions suggests Front National leader Marine Le Pen will receive\nenough votes to progress to the second round and is likely to be joined by Republican\ncandidate Francois Fillon. Although when Fillon and Le Pen are polled together in a\nsecond round runoff Fillon is ahead by ~65%-35%, Le Pen is seen as capable of\nappealing to the same anti-establishment / blue collar voters as Trump/ Brexit.\nChart 37: Vol already picking up around the French primaries next year\n26\n25.5\n25\n24.5\n24\n23.5\n23\n22.5\n22\nVSTOXX 11/29/2016 VSTOXX -1m\n21.5\n21\nSource: Bloomberg\nChart 38: Yet Fillon still well ahead of Le Pen in polls of a potential runoff\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n12-14\nApril\n15-17\nApril\n13-16\nMay\n10-12\nJune\n14-17\nJune\n9-11\nSept\nFrancois Fillon (%) Marine Le Pen (%)\n25-Nov 27-Nov\nSource: Ifop (12-14 Apr, 14-17 Jun), BVA (15-17 Apr, 13-16 Mar, 10-12 Jun, 9-11 Sept), Odoxa (25\nNov), Harris Interactive (27 Nov). Note: all 2016.\nInvestors’ biggest concerns are that we could see the same narrowing of polls in favour\nof Le Pen into the election months as we saw in the UK/US. We think this could mean\nFrench political risk becomes a major overhang for European equities in H1 2017. The\nworry is that a Le Pen Presidency could bring the future of the EU and the Euro into\nquestion as she has talked about France withdrawing from both and is especially an\nissue because of the winner takes it all nature of French presidential elections. As James\n16 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nBarty argued in The Trump Inflection, Le Pen’s victory has the potential to be even more\nof an earthquake for the world’s financial markets. Indeed, we have already seen a 1vol\nmove in April 2017 V2X futures since last month.\nSo our central case is French political risk caps markets to the upside for Q1 and most\nof Q2 but that the centre right candidate Fillon is elected President. As Gilles Moec\nargues, his pro-market reformist agenda could unlock French growth and we think it\ncould prove a significant positive catalyst for European equities more broadly if the\npolitical risk premium is priced out against a solid European and global growth backdrop.\nMore of the same expected in Germany\nWe think Germany carries less political risk than the French election now that Merkel\nhas formally announced she will run again to be Chancellor.

Going forward we see it as\nan ongoing issue but mostly for the UK (see UK – Waiting for Brexit for more details).\nRising bond yields & equities\nWith the market focus on the sharp bond market sell-off it is worth re-visiting the links\nbetween equities and bonds as many investors question whether the effect on equities\nwill become negative the more yields rise. An environment of rising bond yields is not\ninherently problematic. Over time correlations between bond yields and equities have\nvaried and on average have been very weak (if slightly positive) over the last twenty\nyears. Typically when rising yields reflect improving growth conditions and or rising risk\nappetite equities have naturally benefitted. Certainly since 2010 for the most part\nhigher yields were accompanied by higher equity prices.\nTrack record mixed for stocks following bond yield spike. Does an exceptionally\nsharp back up in bond yields represent a downside risk for equities? The historical\nevidence is inconclusive. We looked at equity market returns in the months following\n2.5SD moves in German bond yields (based on a comparison of rolling 3-month yield\nchanges to the 52-week average). The recent spike in German yields peaked at +2.9SD\non the same basis. We found 11 comparable episodes since 1980. Equity market returns\nsubsequent to the peak rate of change in bunds were moderately positive – a median\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 17\n+1.0% after 3 months and +3.7% after 6 months. Subsequent returns were positive in\nsix of the eleven episodes and negative in the other five. Those stats are a little worse\nthan the comparable numbers for the full sample but don’t indicate that a bond yield\nspike is definitively negative for equities.\nChart 40: Rolling 3-month change in bond yields and equities\n100\n20\n15\n50\n10\n0\n5\n0\n-50\n-5\n-10\n-100\n-15\n-150\n-20\n01/10 01/12 01/14 01/16\nGerman 10Y 3m chg (LHS, bp) MSCI Europe 3m chg %\nTable 3: Track record mixed for stocks following bond yield spike\nSubsequent equity market returns following spike in bond yields (3m change >2.5SD)\n3m change in bund\nyields hits peaks\n>2.5SD Next 3m % Next 6m % Prior 3m %\n10/06/1983\n08/03/1985\n4.4\n5.3\n9.2\n10.2\n7.9\n11.1\n02/03/1990 5.9 -6.9 -0.4\n25/03/1994\n15/03/1996\n-7.5\n4.7\n-4.7\n7.0\n-3.4\n4.9\n09/07/1999 -3.6 9.8 3.7\n22/08/2003\n15/06/2007\n1.0\n-7.1\n10.4\n-6.1\n12.1\n11.1\n13/06/2008 -8.1 -32.1 1.6\n26/11/2010\n08/05/2015\n6.0\n-1.2\n3.7\n-5.6\n7.2\n5.9\nMedian return 1.0 3.7 5.9\n% positive 55% 55% 82%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nIt matters why yields are rising – higher inflation breakevens key for stocks.\nDigging a little deeper shows that the underlying dynamics in the bond market matter.\nEssentially rising inflation breakevens is the key driver for equities. Even when real\nyields are rising it is the change in implied inflation that has correlated most strongly\nwith equity returns in recent years. Looking at 4-week rolling returns since 2009, in the\nperiods that real yields rose Stoxx 600 returns were a median +1.7% if breakevens were\nalso higher at the same time. In contrast a combination of higher real yields and lower\ninflation breakevens led to a median -0.7% return.\nChart 41: Inflation breakevens on the rise in recent bond market move\n2.5\n2.0\nChart 42: Rising inflation breakevens the key for equities\n2.0\nStoxx 600 4-week returns vs 4-week change in real\nyields / inflation breakevens (since 2009)\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0 German inflation linked 10y\n-1.5\nGerman 10y breakeven\n01/10 01/11 01/12 01/13 01/14 01/15 01/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\nBund real >+0, b/even +ve\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nBund real >+0, b/even -ve\n18 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nWhat then is the prospect for inflation expectations from here? Breakevens have moved\nsignificantly already in the context of the Euro area inflation outlook. 5-year, 5-year\nforward inflation swaps have recovered all the ground they lost earlier in 2016 in Europe\nand are back to end 2014 levels in the US. At 1.6% in Europe and 2.44% in US there is\narguably more limited upside. A return to the range for inflation expectations that\nprevailed in 2013/14 before the oil price collapse would imply another 30-50bp from\nhere. However, at least in the case of Europe our economists see the outlook for\ninflation remaining very subdued. Overall we would conclude that equities can see\nupside from here if bond yields rise towards our fixed income team’s targets as long as\ninflation expectations are stable to rising at the same time.\nRising bond yields pushing Italian spreads wider a risk for equities. Although rising\ncore rates are not necessarily problematic for stocks, an important caveat is the fall out\nin other parts of the bond markets – particularly in the periphery. The equity market in\nEurope is sensitive to rising Italian bond spreads – exhibiting a negative correlation in\nrecent years. This is an important risk at the current juncture given the upcoming\nreferendum in Italy and ECB decision on QE extension. Should Italian bond spreads\nwiden significantly from here it would likely weigh on equity valuations, keeping the risk\npremium high in Europe and in turn offset or outweigh the benefit from rising nominal\ngrowth expectations globally. This is perhaps the biggest potential problem for equities\nin the scenario that bond yields rise further from here. The ECB decision on QE\nextension is an important risk event in that context. As our economists have discussed\nin a recent note the risks of an ECB delay in the short term are increasing but their base\ncase remains a QE extension with some tweaks of the capital key – a relatively benign\noutcome for peripheral sovereigns.\nChart 43: Inflation breakevens – room to normalize further?\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\nUS 5y5y inflation swap\nEuro 5y5y inflation swap\n1.0\n01/09 01/10 01/11 01/12 01/13 01/14 01/15 01/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nChart 44: Wider Italian bond spreads correlate negatively with equities\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\nItaly-Germnay 10 year bond spread (%)\n0.0\n01/10 07/11 01/13 07/14 01/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 19\nSector Strategy\nMarkets due a period of consolidation in the short term. The reflation trade has run\nhard and we’ve taken some chips off the table in recent weeks by cutting our\noverweight positions in Banks and Basic Resources to neutral and reducing the size of\nour underweights in some Defensive sectors. In the short term we look for markets to\nconsolidate. Near term risk reward is also a little poorer in light of event risks around\nthe Italian referendum, OPEC’s decision on a potential cut in oil production quotas and\nthe ECB’s decision on QE extension.\nLook for another leg to the reflation trade in the coming months. We would look for\nanother leg to the cyclical and reflation rotation in the next 1-2 quarters as evidence of\nstronger global growth and rising inflation materializes. We will look to re-enter sector\npositions that benefit from global rotation when short term risk reward improves.\nHowever, we would look for the pace of the rotation to moderate and become less\nbinary from here. The upside from here for bond yields is more limited. With that in\nmind we are likely to be more selective in reflation vs bond proxy positions.\nPolitics likely remains an overhang through 1H 2017. Another reason to run a less\nbinary portfolio over the coming months is the potential for political uncertainty to\nweigh on European markets. Attention near-term will focus on Italy but the French\nPresidential elections loom in April / May and the tail risk of a Marine Le Pen victory will\nact as an overhang for Europe in the coming months. It suggests 22017 may well be a\nyear similar to 2016, in which the major indices in Europe have traded in ranges for\nlarge parts of the year.\nValue in some Defensive bond proxies. Valuation looks quite compelling already in\nsome of the bond proxy sectors. Utilities and Healthcare are both trading at the low end\nof relative valuation ranges and have decent fundamentals in the view of our analyst\nteam. However, rising government bond yields remains the major potential headwind in\ncoming months. We are overweight both sectors.\nFinancials – neutral following the strong recent rally. Banks have re-rated\naggressively, taking PE-relative back to average levels. However, the sector continues to\nhave uncertain prospects for EPS recovery given continued ultra-low policy rates in\nEurope and ongoing tail risks from periphery are an overhang on the sector. Continued\nlong only positioning remains a potential support for the sector should rates and yield\ncurves renew their widening moves. A Risk reward may be better in Insurance – the\nsector still offers the second highest DY in the market (and relative DY is still at 90 th\npercentile of the range since 2004).\nGlobal quality Cyclicals – waiting for an entry point. Many cyclicals have performed\nless strongly in the recent rally than Resources and re-rated less aggressively than\nFinancials. With relative PE valuations in-line with or below 17-year averages for the\nlikes of Industrials, Chemicals and Technology we will look for opportunities to build\npositions in cyclical areas in the coming months. Overowned positioning has been\nsomething of a negative for several of these areas (notably Tech) and any signs of a\ncorrection could be a catalyst to re-enter an overweight in the sector.\nMedia – raise to overweight. With the outlook for markets set to become less binary\nwe will look to add exposure to quality cyclical areas. One such sector that has lagged\nthis year is Media, making this an interesting entry point. The sector is something of\nhybrid combining defensive and cyclical components and high and low quality. Media in\nparticular has come back a long way following a six-month period of sustained\nunderperformance.\nOverweight Oil position dependent on OPEC. As we go to press, the OPEC decision\non a deal to cut oil supplies is pending. Our commodity strategists’ base case has been\nfor some kind of deal, with upside into the mid $50s for a deal to cut 1 million barrels\nper day. However, in the case OPEC fails to agree any deal they see WTI dipping back\n20 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nbelow $40. In other words, the outcome is highly binary in the short term for crude and\nrelated equities. We flag to investors that we would consider reducing our weighting in\nthe event of no deal.\nAssuming OPEC does cut production and oil prices recover up to the high $50s per\nbarrel, as per our commodity strategists views, earnings and cash flows can recover\nsignificantly in the coming 12-18 months. Our Oil analysts model between 8 and 17%\nupside to operating cash flows in 2017 for European integrated stocks if assumed crude\nprices are increased $10 from $50 to $60. That makes the highest DY in market at ~6%\nmore sustainable out of FCF coverage.\nCautious UK domestic (underweight Retail, Travel & Leisure). We are cautious on\ndomestic UK exposure and underweight Retail and Travel & Leisure. To our mind, these\ncompanies face a lose-lose trade-off of maintaining margins by passing on higher costs\nat the expense of volumes, or face margin pressure by absorbing these costs in order to\nsustain current volumes. Building inflationary pressures point to a post-Christmas\nconsumer squeeze. This could be further compounded OPEC cuts and oil prices rise. The\nRetail sector is also facing structural margin pressures and unattractive valuations. In\nTravel & Leisure (two thirds UK listed), profitability is declining from peak levels. Note\nour analysts also see structural pressures on airlines from overcapacity and competition.\nSee below for more details.\nTable 4: European Sector Allocation\nSector Ticker\nIndex\nWeight\n% Stance\nDelta\n(bp)\nPortfolio\nWeight %\nPortfolio /\nBenchmark % Sector Ticker\nIndex\nWeight\n% Stance\nDelta\n(bp)\nPortfolio\nWeight %\nPortfolio /\nBenchmark %\nOil&Gas SXEP 4.6 o/w +150 6.1 132% Autos&Parts SXAP 3.2 n 0 3.2 100%\nHealthCare SXDP 12.5 o/w +150 14.0 112% Banks SX7P 12.4 n 0 12.4 100%\nMedia SXMP 2.6 o/w +100 3.6 138% BasicResou SXPP 3.0 n 0 3.0 100%\nUtilities SX6P 3.9 o/w +100 4.9 125% Chemicals SX4P 5.0 n 0 5.0 100%\nConstr&Mtr SXOP 3.0 n 0 3.0 100%\nTrav&Leisr SXTP 1.8 u/w -150 0.3 15% FinServ SXFP 1.9 n 0 1.9 100%\nFood&Bevrg SX3P 5.9 u/w -150 4.4 75% InduGd&Ser SXNP 11.9 n 0 11.9 100%\nRetail SXRP 3.1 u/w -200 1.1 36% Insurance SXIP 6.4 n 0 6.4 100%\n100.0 +0 100.0 0% Per&HouGds SXQP 8.8 n 0 8.8 100%\nReal Estate SX86P 1.9 n 0 1.9 100%\nTechnology SX8P 3.8 n 0 3.8 100%\nTelecomm SXKP 4.1 n 0 4.1 100%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nReflation rotation – tactically got very stretched\nOver the last two weeks we cut our weightings in Basic Resources and Banks to neutral.\nThat was in response to the signals from our technical models all flashing warning signs\nthat the rotation out of bond proxies into reflation beneficiaries had got very stretched\ntactically. Our Composite Technical Indicators (CTIs) for sector relative performance hit\n+100 at the recent high in the case of Basic Resources and +94 for Banks and\nInsurance. These models combine a range of technical indicators including RSIs, MACDs,\nBollinger bands and others and +100 represents maximum overbought. Basic Resources\nrelative price has also reached +2.7SD above the 52-week average, the highest reading\nfor the sector since 2010. Financials hit +1SD while other cyclicals have also peaked at\n+1.5-2SD in recent weeks.\nBy contrast bonds and equity bond proxies screen as very oversold on these models. All\nDefensives troughed at -92 or below at some point over the last 4 weeks. On Bollinger\nscores, relative prices hit between -2.4SD and -3.8SD for the Defensives and also Real\nEstate. In the case of Utilities (-3.8SD) that is close to a record low. Similarly our CTI\nreadings for macro variables like 10-year Treasury yields, gold and $/yen also hit\noversold levels. The models are useful in isolation for highlighting any anomalies in\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 21\nrecent price action for individual assets. However, the fact that we have had multiple\nsignals across a range of sectors and macro prices is typically a warning that markets\nhave moved too far too fast in a more general sense.\nThe last comparable episode was in early July in the wake of the Brexit sell-off. At that\npoint Defensives were hitting record over bought signals with Financials and Cyclicals\nseeing the opposite. Against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty over the effects of\nBrexit the models provided a great signal to fade the violent rotation.\nWith these signals in mind we look for a period of consolidation in the rotation trade.\nThe models are short term in nature and are not intended to identify strategic turning\npoints – although like in the case of Brexit they do tend to emphasize when a crescendo\nis reached. While we would look for another potential leg in some of the reflation trades\nover the coming months we would prefer to wait for a pull back. The Basic Resources\nsector provides a useful example in how to use the models tactically. Three times this\nyear prior to the current instance the sector has hit overbought levels on its relative CTI\nindicator. Previous pullbacks lasted 4-8 weeks and averaged -11% in relative\nperformance terms.\nTable 5: Composite Technical Indicators for sector relative returns\n(+100 max overbought; -100 max oversold)\nSince Oct 27\nSector Latest MIN MAX\nHealthcare -5 -98 -1\nPersonal & Household Goods 0 -94 0\nFood & Beverages -31 -93 0\nTelecom -25 -92 0\nUtilities -8 -92 3\nTechnology 0 -88 26\nMedia -1 -87 7\nIndustrial Goods & Services 0 -73 35\nOil & Gas 1 -45 4\nAutos 0 -12 8\nChemicals 0 -8 0\nTravel & Leisure 0 -27 37\nFinancial Services -1 -3 43\nConstruction & Materials 0 -17 45\nRetail 0 -42 90\nInsurance 36 0 94\nBanks 16 8 94\nBasic Resources 9 7 100\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nChart 45: Basic Resources 4 th overbought signal this year – previous\npullbacks last 4-8 weeks and averaged -11% relative\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\nCTI relative Basics relative\n-80\n12/15 02/16 04/16 06/16 08/16 10/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n1.2\n1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\nTable 6: Bollinger scores –bond proxies 2.5-3.5SD oversold\n52-week Z-Score\nRecent 1m extreme\nLatest\nUtility -3.8 -2.6\nReal Estate -3.4 -2.1\nMedia -2.9 -1.8\nFood & Bev -2.6 -2.2\nHealthCare -2.5 -1.8\nTelcos -2.4 -2.2\nTravel & Leis -2.1 -0.7\nRetail -1.5 -0.4\nPrs & HH Gds -1.2 -0.6\nAutos 0.8 0.5\nInsurance 0.9 0.8\nTechnology 1.0 0.6\nBanks 1.0 0.6\nFinServ 1.0 0.6\nIndustrials 1.5 1.4\nOils 1.6 0.9\nChemicals 1.9 0.8\nConstruction 2.0 1.2\nBasics 2.7 2.2\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nChart 46: Utilities near a record -4SD oversold vs 52-week average\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n-1.0\n-2.0\n-3.0\n-4.0\nDec-97 Dec-01 Dec-05 Dec-09 Dec-13\nUtility - relative price vs 52wk average (SD)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n22 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nRotation trade – valuations have moved a long way\nWhile technical metrics suggest a pause is due in the reflation rotation, we have also\nseen a significant amount of ground covered from a valuation perspective in the market\nmoves to date.\nThe scatter chart below compares the PE relative change since 8th July (the post Brexit\nvaluation high / low for many sectors) against where PE relative ranks now compared to\nhistory. Essentially sectors in the top right have enjoyed a relative multiple re-rating and\ncurrent relative PE levels are above the median since 1999. Those in the bottom left\nhave seen relative PE multiples de-rate while their current relative PE is below the\nmedian since 1999. We make the following observations:\n• Financials have had the biggest re-rating. Financials re-rated most since\nBrexit and are now trading around median relative valuation levels. Given the\ntight link between relative valuations and bond yields in recent years the PErelatives\nfor Banks and Insurance have also recovered much more than would\nseem justified by the move in the German 10-year yield. The sectors do screen\ncheaper versus history on PBV reflecting relatively depressed ROEs especially\nfor Banks. Hence, we think PE multiple expansion from here would need to be\ndriven by improving EPS prospects in the sector – something our analysts are\nsceptical about.\n• Global Cyclicals trading near or below average relative PE’s. Many global\ncyclicals have had fairly modest re-ratings since early July and trade on close to\nmedian or below valuations. Sectors such as Industrials, Chemicals, Autos, Tech\nhave relative PE multiples 5-10% higher than post Brexit. Relative PE for\nChemicals and Industrials are close to post 1999 averages. Construction PE\nrelative does screen as elevated – at the 92 nd percentile. Autos, Tech and Travel\n& Leisure all have PE relatives in the bottom quartile of their post 1999 range.\nRelative PE valuations look very reasonable on this basis for Tech, Chemicals\nand even industrials. In part this may reflect higher than historical average ROE\n– relative PBV is less flattering for Industrials for example.\n• Resources sectors – de-rating as EPS recovers. Oil and Basic Resources PE\nrelative has declined more than in any other sector. Although both sectors have\nseen strong price performance this year, PE multiples are declining from very\nelevated levels earlier this year as earnings bounce back from depressed levels.\nSince the end of June Basics 12m forward EPS is up +65%, while the sector\nindex price has risen +33%. For Basics and Oil, performance from here is likely\nto remain a function of EPS momentum rather than valuations.\n• Defensives have all de-rated with Telecoms suffering least. Defensive\nsectors have all seen relative valuations decline over the past four months.\nHealthcare and Utilities are the two sectors with multiples at lower end of the\nhistorical range – notably Healthcare at the 14 th percentile. Utilities relative PE\nis also close to the prior low hit in 2013. Telecoms screens as somewhat less\ndepressed form a valuation perspective – notwithstanding the poor sector\nperformance in 2016. PE relative remains well above the median levels since\n1999.\n• Staples approaching 2010/14 lows on PE-relative. Staples have also derated\nseverely – in fact Food & Beverage relative PE fell somewhat more than\nthe other Defensives. However, current levels are still somewhat higher versus\nthe historical range (since 1999) than for Healthcare or Utilities. That being\nsaid, the PE-relative rose structurally through the 2000s. Over a shorter time\nframe since 2010 Food & Beverage is also now trading near the bottom\nquartile. PE-relative is 6-10% above the lows seen in 2010 and 2014 – but\nthose would still allow for healthy 25-30% valuation premiums to the market .\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 23\nOverall, we find it hard to argue that sectors haven’t moved a long way already from a\nvaluation perspective, even against the context of potentially important inflection points\nin bond yields and earnings. From here we suspect investors may need to more selective\nin how they play the rotation theme and consider other variables such as earnings\nmomentum, yield, technicals and positioning when allocating across sectors.\nChart 47: Relative PE – recent re / (de) rating compared to percentile ranking of latest relative multiple\nPE relative - % change since July 8th\n2016\n30\nBanks\n25\n20\nInsurance\n15\n10\n5\nTravel & Leis\nAutos\nTechnology\nChemicals\nFinServ\nIndustrials\nRetail\nConstruction\n0\n-5 Real Estate\nMedia\nTelcos\n-10\n-15\nHealthCare\nUtility\nPrs & HH Gds\nFood & Bev\nOils\nBasics\n-20\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\nRelative PE - percentile since 1999\nChart 48: Financials valuations have recovered significantly relative to\nthe move in bond yields – relative PE back around average levels\n0.90\n3.5\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n0.65\nBanks / Insurance PE-rel\n0.60\nGerman 10y (RHS)\n01/10 01/11 01/12 01/13 01/14 01/15 01/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\nChart 49: Rapid relative de-rating for Staples – relative PE for Food &\nBeverage still 6-10% above 2010 / 2014 levels\n1.70\n-0.5\n1.60\n1.50\n1.40\n1.30\n1.20\nPE-relative FOOD & BEV\n1.10\nGerman 10y (RHS, inverted)\n01/10 01/11 01/12 01/13 01/14 01/15 01/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n24 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nChart 50: Utilities relative PE close to the 2013 low\n1.20\n-0.5\nChart 51: Chemicals / Industrials – re-rated but PE-rel not excessive\n1.30\n5\n1.15\n1.10\n1.05\n1.00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\nPE-relative UTILITIES\n0.80\nGerman 10y (RHS, inverted)\n01/10 01/11 01/12 01/13 01/14 01/15 01/16\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n1.25\n1.20\n1.15\n1.10\n1.05\n1.00\nChemicals / Industrials PE-rel\nGerman 10y (RHS)\n0.95\n01/08 01/10 01/12 01/14 01/16\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\nUK – Waiting for Brexit\nIt’s useful to think about where the UK is today in terms of the four risk factors we\nidentified in our February 2016 Brexit preview: 1) weaker GBP; 2) weaker UK growth; 3)\nHigher UK risk premia & gilt yields; 4) increased regulatory, political and market\nuncertainty.\nAlthough we saw a severe risk-off move immediately following the Brexit vote, the only\ntruly significant post-Brexit delta has been a weaker GBP. GBP is down 16% vs USD and\n11% on a trade weighted basis. In fact, a simple post-Brexit strategy of going equal\nweighted long UK-listed sectors with above market international sales exposure vs\nsectors with below market sales exposure would have delivered ~110% returns in USD.\nChart 52: GBP and sales exposure have been the key determinants for post-Brexit UK equity\nreturns\nPerformance since Brexit (%$ in USD)\n30%\n20%\nUK MATERIALS $\n10%\nUK FD/STAPLES\n0%\nUK BANKS $\nUK CAP GDS $\nUK INSURANCE $ UK U$\nRTL $\nUK ENERGY $\n-10%\nUK UTILITIES $ UK DIV FIN $\n-20% UK REAL ESTATE UK RETAILING $\n$\nUK MEDIA $\nUK T/CM SVS $\nUK PH/BIO L SCI $\nUK H/H PERS\nPRD $\n-30%\nUK TRANSPT $\n-40%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n% International Sales exposure\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Factset.

What Brexit, you could ask.\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 25\nAs we outline below, we think it is just a matter of timing. The political certainty created\nby the swift election of Theresa May plus the Bank of England’s interventions have\ndelayed, rather than resolved, the underlying uncertainties caused by the vote.\nChart 53: UK PMIs tanked post-Brexit but have recovered\n65\n60\n55\nAverage\nsince 2010\nComposite PMI\n50\nGDP, % qoq, preliminary\nestimates (rhs)\n45\nMar-10 Mar-11 Mar-12 Mar-13 Mar-14 Mar-15 Mar-16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Markit, ONS.\n1.4\n0.9\n0.4\n-0.1\n-0.6\nChart 54: While retail sales have remained strong\n10\n8\nOct retail\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n1984\nConsumer confidence\nReal consumption, %yoy\nRetail sales volumes ex fuel, % yoy\n1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008\nBAML est. of\nconfidence if\ninflation\n2012\n@3%\n2016\nRetail sales volumes.

But the UK Office\nof Budgetary Responsibility expects growth to slip by 0.8% next year (2.2% to 1.4%) and\n0.4% on 2018 (2.1% to 1.7%) vs March. A notable slice of this is can be attributed to the\nOBR’s estimate that Brexit added £59bn to UK borrowing to 2022, or nearly £200mn a\nweek. These numbers include Phillip Hammond’s sensible but small measures. Our UK\neconomist is more pessimistic forecasting 0.9% in 2017 and 0.7% in 2018. Even if we\nsplit the two, that represents a 50% decline in expected 2017 gdp and 40% decline in\n2018. The OBR also expects public sector net debt to hit its highest level since 1964-65\nin 2017-18 at a time when the UK already relies on “the kindness of strangers” to\nfinance its growing twin deficit.\n26 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nChart 55: OBR / BofAML UK GDP forecasts\nmaterially lower in 2017\n2.1 2.0\nOBR real gdp %yoy growth forecast\nBAML real gdp %yoy growth forecast\nOBR UK real gdp %yoy growth March vs Nov 2016 forecasts\n1.4\n0.9\n1.7\n0.7\n0.1\n2016 2017 2018 -0.4\n-0.8\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Office of Budgetary\nResponsibility\nChart 56: UK Public sector net debt is expected\nto return to 1960s levels\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nUK Public sector net\ndebt as % GDP…\n1960-61\n1964-65\n1968-69\n1972-73\n1976-77\n1980-81\n1984-85\n1988-89\n1992-93\n1996-97\n2000-01\n2004-05\n2008-09\n2012-13\n2016-17\n2020-21\nSource: Office of Budgetary Responsibility\nChart 57: The weaker econ outlook has helped\ndecouple GBP and gilts since late Sept’16\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\nOct-15\nDec-15\nSource: Bloomberg\nFeb-16\n10y gilt yield\nGBP/USD (RHS)\nApr-16\nJun-16\nAug-16\nOct-16\n1.6\n1.55\n1.5\n1.45\n1.4\n1.35\n1.3\n1.25\n1.2\nCertainty that Brexit negotiations will start, but uncertainty on the details\nAgainst this debt and growth backdrop, investors are likely to want clarity and visibility\non policymaking in order to continue funding the UK’s deficit in our view. We think they\ncould be disappointed.\nFirstly, the Government has committed to triggering Article 50 by the end of March\n2017. We think this is likely irrespective of the outcome of the Judicial Review on where\nthe legislative power lies for making that decision. Second, the Government’s formal\nposition is not to announce its negotiating strategy in public. A lack of insight into the\nUK’s future trading relationship with its biggest export market for goods and services is\na difficult backdrop upon which to continue investing in the UK, even if a few companies\nhave taken that decision already. Third, we think there will have to be a resolution to the\ntrade-off between the Government’s desire to control immigration and reach a\nbeneficial economic settlement. The problem, as is often repeated by EU leaders, is that\ncurbing migration puts the UK on a collision course with the EU’s four freedoms and\ntherefore at odds with access to the single market. That’s why our base case remains a\nso called “hard Brexit”, but even now our colleagues in FX strategy think investors are\nnot positioned for this. Hence their GBP/USD forecast of 1.15 for Q1/Q2 2017.\nFinally, a major concern for investors and especially business investment would be if the\nUK faces a “cliff edge” for trade terms in 2019 (on the assumption article 50 is\ntriggered). While a transition deal would be a potential positive development next year,\nthe absence of such a deal before or soon after article 50 is triggered could be another\nreason for policy uncertainty to spike higher again.\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 27\nChart 58: The dip in UK policy risk is likely to be short lived if the Govt keeps to its commitment to\ntrigger A50 in Q1 without providing clarity on its negotiating position\n1200\n1000\n800\nUK Economic Policy Uncertainty\nGerman Economic Policy Uncertainty\n600\n400\n200\n0\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nSource: Bloomberg\nBuilding inflationary pressures point to post-Christmas consumer squeeze\nThe third act in waiting for Brexit is cost-push inflation from the fall in GBP. So far,\nconsumer spending has held up far better than most expected, especially retail spending\nby the over 50s. But there is evidence the inflationary canary is starting to sing.

The incident also illustrates\nthe margin pressure building up in the system and challenges posed to producers,\nvendors and consumers as to who will absorb the higher costs. According to the\nChairman of the UK Food and Drink Federation many companies may be waiting until\npost-Christmas to change prices, which Ian Wright estimates could rise as much as 8%.\nIf that happens at the same time as power prices hit seasonal highs, the consumer could\nstart to feel the pinch.\nTo avoid this leading to a contraction in demand, workers we would need to see strong\nnominal wage growth. However, the Institute of Fiscal Studies does not expect real\nwages to return to 2008 levels until 2021. The tightness of the UK labour market could\nalso cushion any blow, but we note jobless claims have started to rise again and\nbusinesses may be less likely to hire if uncertainty, for reasons outlined above, picks up\nagain.\n28 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016\nChart 62: Real wages likely to fall\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\nReal wages, BAML forecast\n-4\nAverage weekly earnings, % 3m yoy\nCPI inflation, BAML forecast\n-6\n2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018\nReal wages calculated as average weekly earnings minus CPI inflationSource: BofA Merrill Lynch\nGlobal Research, ONS.\nChart 63: REC and PMI point to higher unemployment\n150 Claimant count, 3m change, inverted\nREC placements, lagged 3m (rhs)\n100\nComposite PMI employment (rhs)\n50\n0\n-50\n-100\n-150\n-200\n-250\n2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\nREC placements is an average of permanent and temporary placements.

To our mind, these companies face a lose-lose\ntrade-off of maintaining margins by passing on higher costs at the expense of volumes,\nor face margin pressure by absorbing these costs in order to sustain current volumes in\nour view. This could be further compounded if our Oil Strategists’ forecasts are right\nand Brent averages ~$60/bb following an OPEC cut.\nBut how much is in the price?\nThe pushback to our view is that the forecasted deterioration in growth hasn’t really\nmaterialised and investors are already pricing it in a lot of bad news. For instance,\nEasyjet is down nearly 35% and investors are still underweight the UK in the FMS. While\nthis is the case for certain stocks, at a sector level investors appear to have squared off\ntheir underweights in Retail/ Travel according to the FMS. Both sectors also back near\npre-Brexit levels relative to the market (albeit Travel reflects the recent oil price\nweakness).\nChart 64: Source: Brexit sectors no longer underowned by investors\nConstruction\nInd.

EBITDA margins have fallen\nfrom 8% in 2010 to close to 7% in 2016 and RoE has declined by nearly 3% since\n2004. We think this structural trend has further to run.\n• Valuations are also unattractive. Retail remains on a significant premium to the\nmarket on absolute terms (17.3x 2017 PE vs 14.2x) and is expensive versus its own\nhistory at 20% above its 10y relative average on PE and 92%ile on PBV, while it has\nthe second lowest dividend in the market (2.9%). Even if you strip H&M and Inditex\nthe sector is towards the higher range of its post-GFC range.\n• UK supermarkets have had their relief rally. Despite challenges facing UK food\nretailers, Tesco has rallied 25% and Morrison’s 15% since Brexit as retail spending\nhas held up and the short base grew massively immediately following the UK-EU\nvote. Yet as Xavier Le Mene notes, this has largely been because they have gained\nmarket share from Asda and investors have bought into their new management\nplans. However, Xavier see limited upside potential for either next year and there is\na risk that Asda starts to recoup lost ground under its new management too.\nChart 66: Stiff competition means retail margins are structural declining\n8.3%\n7.8%\n7.3%\nRetail EBITDA margin\n6.8%\nChart 67: Market share gains have largely been at Asda’s expense\nTesco\nAldi\nLidl\nWaitrose\nMorrisons\nSainsbury's\nAsda\n-100 -50 0 50 100\nMarket share of grocers, yoy\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Datastream, IBES\nSource: Kantar Worldpanel\nChart 68: Retail is expensive on a range of metrics\nChart 69: Not cheap even if you strip out the two biggest ex-UK names\n1.70\n1.60\n1.50\nRetail 12m fwd PBV relative\n16\nStoxx Retail PE\nStoxx Retail ex-Inditex PE\nStoxx Retail ex-Indi/H&M PE\n1.40\n1.30\n11\n1.20\n1.10\n1.00\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 201\n6\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Datastream, IBES\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream\nEuropean Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 31\nUnderweight Travel & Leisure\n• Airlines in structural decline: our European Airlines analyst thinks overcapacity\n(networks set to grow 7% yoy to 2020) and competition from low cost/ ME carriers\nis driving prices and passenger yields lower across the board.\n• Negatively correlated to Oil: the sector is negatively correlated to the Oil price\nand despite recent weakness, our Commodity Strategist expects OPEC to cut by\n500k b/d or 1 million b/d. Should OPEC cut with firm quotas and a tight control\nmechanism, they see WTI prices averaging $59/bbl.\n• Watch UK consumer confidence closely: the combined effect of the challenges\nwe identified earlier starting to mount for the UK consumer and the drop in the\nvalue of the pound could reduce demand for and expenditure on overseas holidays.\nThis would weigh on the travel operator part of the sector. If the bulk of sterling\nmove is over the boost for dollar earnings like Compass will also likely fade.\n• Peak returns: unlike Retail, T&L margins (98%ile since 2004) and RoEs (85%ile) are\nclose to all-time highs. We think returns may well have peaked therefore given the\nbackdrop of rising oil, weakening consumer confidence in the UK and structural\novercapacity in airlines.

Our sector analysts\nforecast EU Pharma to deliver a 2018-21E EPS CAGR of 11%, up from mid-single digit\nlevels in recent years. Historically that would justify a PE re-rating and a multiple for the\npharma sub-sector nearer 17-18x than the current 13x 2018 PE.\nWe believe the Republican clean sweep in the US elections represents a positive\ncatalyst as it significantly decreases the potential for legislative initiatives to\naggressively control drug pricing in the US. The catalyst for the sector to re-rate will\ncome progressively from newsflow around new products.

However,\nfundamentals for the sector are actually improving relative to recent history. The sector\nis the biggest direct beneficiary of corporate QE in the UK and Euro are (more than half\nof the sector are eligible for the ECB’s Corporate Sector Purchase Program) meaning it\ncan gain more than most other sectors from potential refinancing savings. This cushions\nany effect on debt costs from higher bond yields as corporate bond yields are still very\nlow.\nEarnings and cash flow are improving. The bottoming out of the commodity cycle has\nsupported a turn to the upside for power prices. This has helped earning to trough and\nanalyst revisions have been positive throughout the last few months of\nunderperformance. Balance sheets and dividends in most cases now also look\nsustainable. Valuation multiples for the Utilities sector are attractive relative to history\nand compared to other Defensives. EV/EBITDA for the sector sits at 7.3x on Bloomberg\nestimates. That is a 20% discount to the market and is near 10-year lows on a relative\nbasis.

VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%\nNeutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%\nUnderperform N/A ≥ 20%\n* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s).
