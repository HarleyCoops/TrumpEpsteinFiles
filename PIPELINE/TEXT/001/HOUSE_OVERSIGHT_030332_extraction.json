But if Ms. Ruemmler is nominated, \nthe advice she dispensed to the White House about the I.R.S. scandal and the attacks on Benghazi, Libya, \nwill certainly draw scrutiny. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
