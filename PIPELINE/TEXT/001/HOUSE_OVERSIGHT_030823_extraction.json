Brown \nA Division of Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. \n280 Park Avenue, 3 East \nNew York, NY 10017 \nphone \nfax \nSubject: Little Hodiaki \nThe teacher said, \"Let's begin by reviewing some American History. \nWho said 'Give me Liberty, or give me Death'?\" \nShe saw a sea of blank faces, except for Little Hodiaki a bright foreign \nexchange student from Japan, who had his hand up:'Patrick Henry, 1775' \nshe said..'Very good!' \nWho said, 'Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall \nnot perish from the Earth?' \nAgain, no response except from Little Hodiaki, 'Abraham Lincoln, 1863'.. \n'Excellent!', said the teacher continuing, 'let's try one a bit More difficult.: \nWho said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country?' \nOnce again, Hodiaki's was the only hand in the air and he said;'John F. Kennedy, 1961'. \nThe teacher snapped at the class, 'Class, you should be ashamed of yourselves, Little Hodiaki isn't from this \ncountry and he knows more about our history than you do.' \nShe heard a loud whisper: fuck the Japs,' \n'Who said that? I want to know right now!' she angrily demanded. \nLittle Hodiaki put his hand up, 'General MacArthur, 1945.' \nAt that point, a student in the back said, 'I'm gonna puke.' \nThe teacher glares around and asks, 'All right!!! Now who said that!?' \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030823 \nAgain, Little Hodiaki says, 'George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister,1991.' \nNow furious, another student yells, 'Oh yeah? Suck this!' \nLittle Hodiaki jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, \n'Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!' \nNow with almost mob hysteria someone said, 'You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you.' \nLittle Hodiaki frantically yells at the top of his voice,'Michael Jackson to the child witnesses testifying against \nhim, 2004.' \nThe teacher fainted. \nAs the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said,'Oh shit, We're screwed!' \nLittle Hodiaki said quietly, 'the American people, November 4, 2008. \nRegards, \njac \n0 \nwww.carbonacapital.com  \nThis communication may contain confidential and/or privileged information. \nIf you are not the intended recipient (or have received this communication \nin error) please notify the sender immediately and destroy this \ncommunication.
