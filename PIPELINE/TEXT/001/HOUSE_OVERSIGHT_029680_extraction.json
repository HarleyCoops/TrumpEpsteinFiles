The 4 billion would be deposited in the Central Bank. But they want us to set up a special \npurpose vehicle, a construction company fully owned by the government to receive the loan. Such a company \ncan only be set up under a presidential decree. \nI am also told that the funds manager would be charging Maldives upfront a certain percentage of the amount \nlent. \nI don't feel I have enough information on this. I don't know who is this funds manager. They always want the \nfinance minister to meet them in Bangkok or some place outside. Why would anyone want to deposit such a \nlarge amount here when we don't have a credit rating and public debt is so high. I feel very uncomfortable \nabout this. \nWhat do you think I should do. I am very uncomfortable. In addition to the finance minister, a leading \npolitician and leader of the coalition parliamentary group is behind it. He could be my leading contender for \npresidency. \nDoes this sound all ridiculous to you. I have a strange feeling about this whole thing. \nBest regards \nWaheed \nSent from President's iPad \nOn Jan 18, 2013, at 5:06 PM, Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nas chairman of the council of europe , he is really mr human rights, Im sure that if he can be of help, he will \nOn Fri, Jan 18, 2013 at 5:27 AM > wrote: \nI remember meeting Jagland at your place when I came with Sultan. \nSent from Windows Mail \nFrom: Jeffrey Epstein \nSent: 18 January, 2013 2:40 AM \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029680 \nTo: Mohamed Waheed Hassan \nSubject: Re: \nalso be advised that thorbjorn jagland is a great friend. \nOn Thu, Jan 17, 2013 at 3:26 PM, Mohamed Waheed Hassan <.> wrote: \nHi, \nWould be great if Lisa could visit us. She sounds like the right person to help us get organized. \nMaldives just got elected Vice President of International Renewable Energy Agency. We are also Vice Chair \nof the UN Human Rights Council. Not too bad considering we had so much bad coverage this year \ninternationally. \nBest regards, \nWaheed \nSent from President's iPad \nOn Jan 17, 2013, at 7:01 PM, Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nmy friend in sweden, lisa svensson, would be perfect as your right hand orgainzing your team„ she has \ndiplomaitc experieince and is currently amabssador to the oceans for sweden \nOn Thu, Jan 10, 2013 at 11:00 AM, Mohammed Waheed Hassan ___________________________ wrote: \nHi, \nThe campaign team is starting to come together. We are continuing discussions with Jim and tomorrow \nwe will meet him face to face on skype. We will brief him on the situation here so that he will be able to \nadvice us more effectively. Already he has sent some very useful suggestions and we are working on them. \nGetting the right people to head various aspects on the campaign is difficult here but we should be able to \npull the team together shortly. \nWe will need some more help from Ian and Rory because we are still weak on international \ncommunication. Some old negative stuff keeps coming up in the Guardian newspaper in England. But most \nof the international media is not paying much attention to Maldives right now. \nI have asked Rory to help find a full time communications guy to stay here for about a year to work with \nme. He doesn't have to be an expert, just a good graduate student would do. Some really positive stuff is \nalso happening now and we need the world to know about them. \nWorld Energy Forum and CGI guys are here. I am meeting Clinton people in a few minutes. \nI have some funding now but will ask all friends to help raise more later when things start happening in full \nswing. Election is now scheduled to early September. \nHope all is well and look forward to seeing you here in the not too distant future. \nWarm regards, \nWaheed \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029681 \nOn Jan 9, 2013, at 6:03 PM, Jeffrey Epstein wrote: \nhow is it shaping up? what are the biggest hurdles. \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
