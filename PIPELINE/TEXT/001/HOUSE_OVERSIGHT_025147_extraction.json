It concerns the experienced direction of time: Why is the past so different from the present and \nthe future? This difference is encapsulated in the expression the arrow of time. It is problematic because all the \nknown laws of nature have exactly the same form, whatever direction, in which time is supposed to flow. The \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-1-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025147 \ntechnical expression for this is time-reversal symmetry. This basic property seems to be entirely at odds with the \npronounced unidirectionality of experienced time. In fact, there are several arrows. \n\"Until recent work by myself and my collaborators Tim Koslowski and Flavio Mercati, essentially only one \nproposal had been made—in well over a century—to explain why, despite the time-reversal symmetry of all the \nlaws of nature, these pronounced arrows of time exist, and always have existed, throughout the observable \nuniverse. As I explain in The Janus Point, this sole explanation is a manifest stop gap and satisfies no serious \nscientist. \n\"This has been dubbed the past hypothesis. However, it is not in any sense an explanation that follows from the \nstructure of the law and does not lead to any new prediction. It is an admission of defeat: Modern science fails to \nexplain the most profound aspects of our existence. \n\"The Janus Point is clearly timely because it is about a set of very simple ideas and insights that have the \npotential to solve one of the deepest and longest-standing problems in physics. Everyone is interested in time \nand its numerous puzzling aspects. Proof of that is the success of my earlier book The End of Time, which is still \nselling more than sixteen years after its publication. Some of the ideas conjectured in that book are, in fact, \nrealized in the model now proposed. \n\"For readers, The Janus Point tells the fascinating story of one of the greatest mysteries in science and what \nlooks to be its unexpected and, in principle, remarkably simple solution. More than most books in popular \nscience, its subject resonates profoundly with the reader. Nothing touches us more intimately than the drama of \nbirth, life and death.\" \nJULIAN BARBOUR, an independent researcher, is currently visiting professor at the University of Oxford. He \nhas devoted significant time and effort to issues that lie at the foundations of science, above all the nature of \ntime and motion. His first paper was published in Nature and attracted favorable editorial comment and most \nimportantly led to six years of very valuable collaboration with the well-known Italian theorist Bruno Bertotti. It \nculminated in 1982 with a joint paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, which is now regarded \nas a seminal paper on the interconnection of local dynamics with the universe at large. Barbour made a big \nimpact in the physics community with the publication of his book, The End of Time, in which, according to \nphysicist Lee Smolin, he presented \"a new theory of time that is the most interesting and provocative new idea \nabout time to be proposed in many years.\" \nAMERICAN KINGPIN \nThe Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road \nBy Nick Bilton \n[US — Portfolio, UK — Virgin Books, Audio — Penguin RH; Manuscript; 304 pages; Publication: May 2017] \nFrom New York Times-bestselling author Nick Bilton comes a true-life thriller about the rise and fall of Ross \nUlbricht, aka the Dread Pirate Roberts, the founder of the online black market Silk Road. \nIn American Kingpin Bilton turns his investigative journalism to the story of Ross Ulbricht, the notorious and \nenigmatic founder of a drug empire called Silk Road. This is a true-life thriller about ambition gone awry, \nspurred on by the defining clash of our time: the new world of libertarian-leaning, anonymous, decentralized \nweb advocates and the old world of government control, order, and the rule of law. Bilton's dazzling rendering \nand gift for narrative make for an endlessly fascinating drama. \nIn 2011, Ulbricht, a twenty-six-year-old libertarian idealist and former Boy Scout, launched \"a website where \npeople could buy anything anonymously, with no trail whatsoever that could lead back to them.\" He called it \nSilk Road, opened for business on the Dark Web, and christened himself the Dread Pirate Roberts (after the \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-2-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025148 \nPrincess Bride character). The site grew at a tremendous pace, quickly becoming a $1.2 billion enterprise where \nyou could buy or sell drugs, hacking software, forged passports, counterfeit cash, guns, grenades, and poisons. \nThe Silk Road soon caught the attention of the Feds, who embarked on an epic two-year manhunt for the site's \nproprietor. Ulbricht, in the meantime, struggled to maintain control of his double life and his marketplace, which \nhe originally started to prove that legalizing drugs could make society safer. He gradually abandoned his \nlibertarian ideals to rule Silk Road with increasingly authoritarian force. At one point, he engaged the services of \nhired hit men to take out employees he felt had wronged him. Soon, some of the Federal agents who were \nsupposed to be hunting for Ulbricht were lured into the dark world and switched sides to join him. \nNICK BELTON is a special correspondent for Vanity Fair, where he writes about technology, business, and \nculture, and a contributor at CNBC.

Norton, China— Huazhang, Audio — Audible; Manuscript; Pub Date: April 2017; \n304 pages] \nPioneering neuroscientist Dean Buonomano examines how the brain tells time, predicts the future, and \nunderstands the past in a book that straddles the fields of physics, psychology and neuroscience. \nFew questions are as perplexing and profound as those that relate to time. Philosophers ponder what time is. \nPhysicists grapple with why time appears to be a one-way street, and debate whether it is a single lonely point or \na full-blown dimension. Neuroscientists and psychologists struggle to understand what it means to \"feel\" the \npassage of time and how the brain tells it. Time is also key to the question of free will: is the future an open \npath, or is it preordained by the past? \nThe brain, argues Buonomano, is at its core a time machine. It is the brain's ability to anticipate the actions of \nprey, predators, and mates, and to predict when events will occur in a dynamically changing world, that \nultimately translate into the evolutionary currency of survival and reproduction. \nThe ability of animals to predict the future culminated with Homo sapiens' capacity to grasp the concept of time. \nOnly then were we able to craft a blade for future use, or plant a seed to quench projected hunger. \nYour Brain is a Time Machine explains that, in the end, our intuitions and theories about time reveal as much \nabout the architecture and limitations of our brains as they do about the true nature of time. \nDEAN BUONOMANO is a professor in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology at UCLA, and an \ninvestigator in the Integrative Center for Learning and Memory. He is the author of Brain Bugs: How the Brain's \nFlaws Shape Our Lives, which was a Wall Street Journal bestseller, and his research has been highlighted in \nmany national and international magazines and newspapers, including Discover, Newsweek, Scientific American, \nZeit, Cosmos, Horzu Wissen, and the New Yorker. \nBrockman, Inc.

As much as his full length books such as The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, and The God Delusion, \nhave changed our perceptions of both science and the world it opens, his essays and articles are potent, pithy, \nthought provoking and revealing windows into the world as he, himself, perceives it. Science in the Soul is a \ncollection of some of Dawkins' best writing: articles and lectures, reflections and polemics, reviews, forewords, \ntributes or eulogies, both published and unpublished. \nFrom the introduction, by Gillian Somerscales: \"Richard Dawkins has always defied categorization. One \neminent biologist of mathematical bent reviewing The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype was startled to \nfind a scientific work apparently free of logical errors and yet containing not a single line of mathematics; he \ncould come to no other conclusion than that, incomprehensible as it seemed to him, 'Dawkins . . . apparently \nthinks in prose.' \n\"If readers of what follows here come to appreciate not only the writer's clarity of thought and facility of \nexpression, the fearlessness with which he confronts very large elephants in very small rooms, the energy with \nwhich he devotes himself to explication of the complex and the beautiful in science, but also some of the \ngenerosity, kindness and courtesy that have characterized all my dealings with Richard over the years since that \nfirst collaboration, then the present volume will have achieved one of its aims. \n\"It will have achieved another if it embodies a condition felicitously described in one of the essays reproduced \nhere, where 'harmonious parts flourish in the presence of each other, and the illusion of a harmonious whole \nemerges.' Indeed, it is my belief that the harmony resounding from this collection is no illusion, but the echo of \none of the most vibrant, and vital, voices of our times.\" \nRICHARD DAWKINS is the former Charles Simonyi Professor For The Understanding Of Science at Oxford \nUniversity; Fellow of New College; author of The Selfish Gene, The Extended Phenotype, The Blind \nWatchmaker, River out of Eden (ScienceMasters Series), Climbing Mount Improbable, Unweaving the \nRainbow, The Devil's Chaplain, The Ancestor's Tale, The God Delusion, The Greatest Show on Earth and The \nMagic of Reality.

Norton, UK — Penguin UK, Italy — Raffaello Cortina Editore, Holland — Atlas \nContact, China — Cheers, Audio — Recorded Books; Manuscript; Pub Date: February 2017; 448 pages] \nOne of the world's foremost philosophers offers a major new account of the origins of the conscious mind. \nWhat is human consciousness and how is it possible? This question fascinates people from poets and painters to \nphysicists, psychologists, and philosophers. From Bacteria to Bach and Back is Daniel C. Dennett's brilliant \nanswer, extending perspectives from his earlier work in surprising directions, exploring the deep interactions of \nevolution, brains, and human culture. \nPart philosophical whodunit, part bold scientific conjecture, this landmark work enlarges themes that have \nsustained Dennett's legendary career at the forefront of philosophical thought. In his inimitable style—laced \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-4-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025150 \nwith wit and arresting thought experiments—Dennett shows how culture enables reflection by installing a \nbounty of thinking tools, or memes, in our brains. Language, itself composed of memes, turbocharged this \ninterplay. The result, a mind that can comprehend the questions it poses, emerges from a process of cultural \nevolution. \nAn agenda-setting book for a new generation of philosophers and other researchers, From Bacteria to Bach and \nBack will delight and entertain anyone who hopes to understand human creativity in all its wondrous \napplications. \nDANIEL C. DENNETT is the author of Intuition Pumps, Breaking the Spell, Freedom Evolves, and \nConsciousness Explained. He is the University Professor and Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Philosophy, and \nco-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University. \nA CRACK IN CREATION \nGene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution \nBy Jennifer A. Doudna and Samuel H. Sternberg \n[US — Houghton Mifflin, UK — Bodley Head, China — Hunan Science, Audio — Audible; Manuscript; Pub \nDate: June 2017; 320 pages] \nIn the tradition of The Double Helix, A Crack in Creation is an insider's account of the biggest scientific \ndiscovery of our era: a cheap, easy way of rewriting genetic code, with nearly limitless promise and peril. \nNot since the atomic bomb has a technology so alarmed its inventors that they warned the world against its use. \nNot, that is, until the spring of 2015, when biologist Jennifer Doudna called for a worldwide moratorium on the \nuse of the new gene-editing tool CRISPR to make heritable changes in human embryos. The cheapest, simplest, \nmost effective way of manipulating DNA ever known, CRISPR may well give us the cure to HIV, genetic \ndiseases, and some cancers, and will help address the world's hunger crisis. Yet even the tiniest changes to DNA \ncould have myriad, unforeseeable consequences—to say nothing of the ethical and societal repercussions of \nintentionally mutating embryos to create \"better\" humans. \nWriting with fellow researcher Samuel Sternberg, Doudna shares the thrilling story of her discovery, and \npassionately argues that enormous responsibility comes with the ability to rewrite the code of life. With \nCRISPR, she shows, we have effectively taken control of evolution. What will we do with this unfathomable \npower? \nJENNIFER A. DOUDNA is a professor in the Chemistry and the Molecular and Cell Biology Departments at \nthe University of California, Berkeley, investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and researcher in \nthe Physical Biosciences Division at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Lieberman is well known for \nhis unique and unusually integrative approach to research, which combines paleontology, anatomy, physiology \nand experimental biomechanics. \n\"Endurance,\" Lieberman writes, \"argues that we need to rethink how we think about exercise using the dual \nlenses of anthropology and evolutionary biology. As the modern word 'exercise' itself implies, people today \ngenerally think of physical activity as a pastime or a form of medicine. Most of us spend the majority of the day \nsitting and then we briefly exercise in our spare time, sometimes for fun, but increasingly to ward off ill health. \nYet, until very recently, physical activity was a paradoxically fundamental part of being human: utterly \nnecessary but instinctively avoided. Put simply, we evolved to be reluctant endurance athletes. \n\"This legacy underlies and points to urgently needed solutions for today's exercise dilemma. Everyone knows \nthat exercise is vital for good health, yet the vast majority of Americans and others in the developed world are \nunable to exercise enough. Our species endured because we had no choice but to be athletes, and if we wish our \nhealth to endure as individuals, then we still need to make exercise indispensable today. Rather than thinking of \nexercise as a 'magic pill' for good health, it is the absence of physical activity, primarily endurance exercise, that \naccelerates aging and hastens death. Endurance points to a new way of understanding and solving this global \nproblem. \n\"Endurance is the product of a long journey, part intellectual, part physical. Over the last decade I have \ntraversed the globe to observe, often as a participant, how humans are physically active in different traditional \ncultures from Africa to Greenland to India. Among other experiences, I've run barefoot and carried water on my \nhead in Kenya, tracked muskoxen and kudu with indigenous hunters in Greenland and Tanzania, participated in \nthe ancient Tarahumara ballgame under the stars in Mexico, dug millet fields in Rwanda, played barefoot cricket \nin rural India, and raced on foot against horses in the mountains of Arizona. Back in my lab at Harvard, my \nstudents and I have intensively studied the evolution, biomechanics and physiology of key human physical \nactivities, including how we walk, run, throw, dig, climb and even chew. \n\"Endurance weaves together these experiences, perspectives and insights into the form of a highly personal \nnatural history of first rest, then strength, and finally endurance.\" \nDANIEL LIEBERMAN is a professor and chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard. \nA leader in the field of human evolutionary biology, Lieberman's research asks how and why evolution made the \nhuman body the way it is. He is the author of The Story of the Human Body (Pantheon, 2013) and has been \npublished in such journals as Nature, Science, and The Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, among \nothers. Lieberman has been interviewed by PBS, The History Channel, NPR, BBC, Horizon, and elsewhere. \nHis research and discoveries have been highlighted in the New York Times, Discover, National Geographic, \nRunners World, Running Times, and numerous other journals and newspapers. \nBrockman, Inc.

As E.O. Wilson writes, Losos is a \"world leader in \nresearch and theory of the overlapping fields of herpetology, biodiversity, and species formation.\" \n\"In the last few years,\" Losos writes, \"evolutionary biologists have come to realize that evolution can occur \nmuch more rapidly than Darwin and a century of subsequent biologists ever expected—fast enough, in fact, to \nobserve as it occurs, even during the span of a single research grant! Now that we know that evolution can \nproceed rapidly, experimental studies in natural systems have begun.\" \nLosos' work on lizards has been at the forefront of the experimental evolution movement. Using small \nBahamian islands as test tubes, he and his team have altered conditions and made predictions about how \npopulations should evolve in response. And the results are resoundingly consistent: evolution is extremely \npredictable. \nImprobable Destinies is not only about what we know about evolution, but how we know what we know. Not \njust the technology and theories of science, but where the ideas come from—how researchers think them up, \nhow they are honed by experiences in the field, and how much of science is the serendipitous juxtaposition of \ndisparate ideas brought together by unexpected observations. \nJONATHAN LOSOS is the Monique and Philip Lehner Professor for the Study of Latin America and professor \nof organismic and evolutionary biology at Harvard University. He is the recipient of a number of awards, \nincluding the Theodosius Dobzhansky Prize from the Society for the Study of Evolution and the David Starr \nJordan Prize from the American Society of Naturalists. \nDISEMPOWERED \n(working title) \nBy Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt \n[Proposal; Delivery: 9-12 months from signing contract; 60,000 — 80,000 words] \nDisempowered is an expansion to book-length of the cover story by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt that \nappeared in the September 2015 issue of The Atlantic: \"The Coddling of The American Mind\" (CAM). \nIt became the Atlantic's second most-read cover story of all time and has been referenced in hundreds of articles \nin a wide variety of publications, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, National Review, \nNewsweek, Los Angeles Times, Bloomberg, the Guardian, The Korea Herald, and the Irish Times; and it even \ndrew the attention of President Obama. \n\"A full-length book is necessary for several reasons,\" writes Lukianoff. \"First, even with the article's generous \nword limit, we could not present the full scope of the intersection of harmful psychological theories and political \ncorrectness. We could only do a cursory explanation of the new reality on campus and how terms like 'trigger \nwarnings,' microaggressions,' and `disinvitations' suddenly rose from obscurity to become part of higher \neducation's and the nation's vocabulary. A full-length book allows us to cover a host of new hot topics, including \nso-called 'safe spaces' and how a warped idea of safety is used to justify campus censorship, as well as campus \n'bias response teams' (BRTs)—Orwellian programs that police the language students use in their private lives \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-7-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025153 \nand professors use in the classroom. It is worth noting that this past spring a professor was actually investigated \nby one of these BRTs for assigning CAM as class reading! \n\"Second, since the article was published, the situation on campus has only worsened. Within a few months after \nthe article's release, student demands for censorship had broken out across the country. \n\"Third, and possibly most importantly, we want to reactivate and deepen the discussion that we started in CAM \nabout the science of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a useful lens for looking at any number of modern \nproblems. CBT is a remarkably simple, successful treatment that helps patients overcome their anxiety and \ndepression by teaching them how to identify and combat 'cognitive distortions,' the wild mental exaggerations \nin which the anxious and depressed overindulge. To our knowledge, CAM was the first and only major article to \npropose that we should not only use CBT to examine our own inner thoughts, but also the world around us. \n\"The issue of free speech on campus is extremely hot, and will continue to be for years to come, but virtually no \none besides us is offering a solution that gets to the heart of the problem and can actually help students rather \nthan simply ridiculing them. \n\"Regarding the market, when CAM came out, it seemed that this was a uniquely American problem. But just in \nthe last year, it has spread throughout the UK, and is beginning to appear in Australia. In fact, there has been \nmajor interest in CAM in the UK and European countries. In Europe, I was recently interviewed by \nSiiddeutsche Zeitung, Germany's biggest daily newspaper, and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung also ran a major \narticle. When I recently spoke in Denmark, the president of the University of Oslo chastised me for not \nknowing that all the students had read CAM and had been discussing it all year.\" \nGREG LUKIAN01-1-, is an attorney and the president and CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights in \nEducation (FIRE).

The common wisdom in psychology and in the social \nBrockman, Inc.

This is the answer of most social psychologists. \n\"They take the famous Asch conformity experiments, in which participants believe a group over the evidence of \ntheir own eyes; and Milgram obedience experiments, in which participants agree to electrocute one another at \nthe experimenter's request to show that people are sheep. \n\"Psychologist Daniel Gilbert, a strong proponent of the view that humans are gullible, has even claimed that \npeople couldn't help but believe (at first at least) everything they read! Tim Levine, a leading researcher \nworking on lie detection, thinks that people rely on others to be trustworthy most of the time, and that as a result \nthey can afford to be so bad at detecting deception. Paul Ekman, the famous emotion researcher, claims that \nwhen we see someone express an emotion, we can't help but mimic it. No surprise then that crowds and \ntheir emotional members drive each other mad! Robert Boyd, Peter Richerson, and Joseph Henrich, proponents \nof the dominant mode of cultural evolution, postulate that people are easily influenced by prestigious individuals \n—wherever their prestige comes from—and consensual opinions—whatever their value. \n\"This is also the answer of dominant figures in anthropology and sociology, explaining the persistence of culture \nby our tendency to suck in whatever ideas surround us without a second thought; in political science since the \nancient Greeks, explaining the success of demagogues by how easily people follow charismatic leaders, even \ntoxic ones; and in much social commentary, consider Manufacturing Consent by Edward Herman and Noam \nChomsky as an example. \n\"In Vigilance, I argue that they are wrong.\" \nHUGO MERCIER is a cognitive scientist working for the French National Center for Scientific Research in \nLyon.

But can \nadaptation by natural selection really account for everything we see in nature? \nYale University ornithologist Richard Prum —reviving Darwin's own views—thinks not. Deep in tropical \njungles around the world are birds with a dizzying array of appearances and mating displays: Club-winged \nManakins who sing with their wings, Great Argus Pheasants who dazzle prospective mates with a four-foot-\nwide cone of feathers covered in golden 3D spheres, Red-capped Manakins who moonwalk. In thirty years of \nfieldwork, Prum has seen numerous display traits that seem disconnected from, if not outright contrary to, \nselection for individual survival. To explain this, he dusts off Darwin's long-neglected theory of sexual selection \nin which the act of choosing a mate for purely aesthetic reasons—for the mere pleasure of it—is an independent \nengine of evolutionary change. \nMate choice can drive ornamental traits from the constraints of adaptive evolution, allowing them to grow ever \nmore elaborate. It also sets the stakes for sexual conflict, in which the sexual autonomy of the female evolves in \nresponse to male sexual control. Most crucially, this framework provides important insights into the evolution of \nhuman sexuality, particularly the ways in which female preferences have changed male bodies, and even \nmaleness itself, through evolutionary time. \nThe Evolution of Beauty presents a unique scientific vision for how nature's splendor contributes to a more \ncomplete understanding of evolution and of ourselves. \nRICHARD 0. PRUM is the William Robertson Coe Professor of Ornithology at Yale University. A lifelong bird \nfanatic, Prum has published more than 100 scientific articles on diverse topics including the evolution, behavior, \nsong, anatomy, developmental biology, phylogenetics, paleontology, optical physics, and pigmentary chemistry \nof birds. He has made ground-breaking scientific contributions to our understanding the evolutionary origin of \nfeathers, the physics of structural coloration, dinosaur feathers, fossil coloration, and the phylogenetic evolution \nof behavior. Over the past thirty years, Prum has developed a unique scientific perspective on evolution, and he \nhas documented this view with major scientific discoveries. \nBrockman, Inc.

Ramachandran \n[US — Penguin Press, Audio — Penguin RH; Proposal; Delivery: 24 months from signed contract; 60,000 — \n70,000 words] \nA new book by neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran, author most recently of The Tell-Tale Brain. \n\"The Interactive Brain,\" writes Ramachandran, \"is a tour of some of the most cherished yet elusive qualities of \nour minds. The book argues that recent advances in neurosciences have contributed to a revolutionary new \nmodel of the brain, in which brain function is controlled, not by highly specialized, hierarchical modules, mainly \nhard-wired, as once thought, but rather by highly interactive modules that can shift their roles in a matter of days \nor even hours The implications are not merely theoretical but have practical applications in medicine, offering \nsolutions for everyone from stroke patients to those with obsessive compulsive disorder. \n\"There are many neurological syndromes I'll discuss throughout the book. For example, a patient who was \notherwise smart and level-headed but kept insisting that his reflection in the mirror was the 'real David,' and that \nthe David viewing the mirror was a clone. He wiped off a tear from his eye and asked 'Dad, if the real David \nreturns will you disown me?' Even the axiomatic foundation of our selfhood—the notion that I'm a single \nperson in one body—is called into question when we encounter patients like him. \n\"Not only can we change our own brains, but we can change the brains of others because of the implications of \nmirror neurons. The Interactive Brain incorporates case studies, such as David's, and my own research on topics \nranging through Capgras Syndrome, chronic pain, calendar synesthesia, gender incongruity, mirror visual \nfeedback, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, the majority of which I have not considered in detail in my \nprevious books. \n\"I conclude by visiting some of the most prized but elusive aspects of our minds considered unapproachable by \nscience, such as math, music, and metaphor, and suggest that these quintessentially human abilities are best \nelucidated by combining an evolutionary approach with old-fashioned neurology.\" \nV.S.

He is author of \nPhantoms in the Brain, which has been translated into fourteen languages and formed the basis of a two part \nseries on Channel Four TV (UK) and a 1 hour PBS special in the USA, and more recently The Tell-Tale Brain \nwhich was a New York Times best-seller. \nt \nBEHAVE \nThe Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst \nBy Robert M. Sapolsky \n[US — Penguin Press, UK — Bodley Head, Germany — Hanser, Holland — Ambo/Anthos, Brazil — \nCompanhia Das Letras, Korea — Munhakdogne, Israel — Kinneret, Audio — Penguin RH; Manuscript; 496 \npages; Publication: April 2017] \n\"Robert Sapolsky is one of the best scientist-writers of our time, able to deal with the \nweightiest topics both authoritatively and wittily, with so light a touch they become \naccessible to all.\" \n—Oliver Sacks, M.D. \nThe first major book from celebrated Stanford neurobiologist and author Robert Sapolsky in over a decade, \nBehave answers the most basic question about human behavior: \"What made you do that?\" Substitute \"me\" or \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-11-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025157 \n\"us\" or \"they\" and it's a question asked millions of times a day in all the languages of the world in response to \nall manner of human behavior, good and bad. \nWhat brings out the best in us? What brings out the worst? For every complex problem, there's a solution that's \nsimple, appealing, and wrong, H. L. Mencken famously said, and there are certainly many simple and wrong \nanswers to this most important of questions, the question at the root of the way we parent, the way we educate, \nthe way we manage, and the way we punish. The simple yet correct response, of course, is that it's \ncomplicated. The longer answer? For that, the great neuroscientist and primatologist Robert Sapolsky needed \nten years, and this book. \nBehave is an epic achievement. In order to make sense of all the sources that conspire to affect human behavior, \nit begins in the very moment of action, when we commit the decisive deed in question. What is happening in \nour brain and body at the very moment, and in the minutes that preceded it? The book then pulls back to look \nhow the behavior is conditioned by what the body is exposed to in the days, weeks and months leading up to \nthat behavior. It then goes back to childhood and adolescence, at how the bending of the bough effects how the \ntree grows. And so on, from neurobiology, endocrinology and the interaction of our senses with the \nenvironment to a lifetime's most primal shaping influences, and from there back to our genetic makeup and the \nvery sticky wicket of how genes and environment interact (and how they don't). Finally, Sapolsky expands the \nview to take in factors that push us past any single person's inheritance and experience: namely culture, in the \npresent tense and back hundreds, even thousands of years, and then back millions of years, to the first humans \nand the evolution of behavior. \nThe result is surely among the most dazzling tours d 'horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, \na majestic synthesis of cutting-edge research, some of it the author's own, across a range of disciplines to \nprovide a subtle and necessary reckoning with the roots of our most troubling and inspiring behaviors, relating \nto racism, tribalism, and xenophobia; tolerance and altruism; hierarchy and competition; morality and free will; \nand war and peace. Wise, learned, funny, and fearless, Behave is a great scientist's towering achievement, a \nbook that takes both the angel and the devil off of our shoulders and into our hands. \nROBERT SAPOLSKY is the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor at Stanford University, holding joint \nappointments in several departments, including Biological Sciences, Neurology & Neurological Sciences, and \nNeurosurgery. He is the author of more than 400 technical papers published in biomedical journals.

Yet this saga is an untold story, as far as today's general audience is \nconcerned. Taming Infinity will tell it for the first time. \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-12-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025158 \n\"Calculus is one of the greatest ideas that anyone has ever had and certainly the greatest idea in all of \nmathematics. The scientific and technological importance of calculus is one reason why we require all budding \nscientists and engineers to learn the subject. Taming Infinity is the human side of calculus: the gripping story of \nhow it was discovered, and lost, and then rediscovered a thousand years later, or how it perplexed many of the \ngeniuses who struggled to invent it, and in a few tragic cases, drove them insane. In a very real sense, this \nhumanistic side of calculus is just as fascinating and important as its scientific side as it, too, has changed the \nworld. \n\"Central to the story is the mathematicians' quest to tame infinity, which begins with the philosopher Zeno of \nElea (about 450 BC, before Socrates) who raised paradoxes about infinity, continuity, time, space, and motion \nthat confounded his contemporaries and provoked no less than Aristotle to banish infinity from Greek \nphilosophy and mathematics from then on. Fast-forward more than 2,500 years, and we're still wrestling with \ninfinity and the paradoxes it raises. In between, the inventors of calculus, starting with Archimedes around 250 \nBC and culminating with Newton and Leibniz in the mid-1600s, tried to domesticate infinity to make what we \nnow regard as integral and differential calculus. And to a large extent, they succeeded. The carefully controlled \nuse of infinity is the secret to calculus, the source of its enormous predictive power. \n\"But like Frankenstein's monster or the golem in Jewish folklore, infinity was never quite under control. As in \nany tale of hubris, the monster inevitably turned on its creator. Soon after the work of Newton and Leibniz, \ndisturbing paradoxes emerged in the 1700s and early 1800s. Calculations came out wrong. Calculus seemed \nunreliable. These difficulties provoked another wave of philosophical and logical handwringing, much as Zeno's \nhad two millennia earlier. These conundrums were resolved over the next century by the mathematicians who \ncalled themselves 'analysts.' The name was apt. They put calculus on the couch, and probed it, trying to root out \nevery last trace of pathology. They succeeded for calculus, but not for infinity itself. There the pathology ran \ndeeper. The riddles of infinity are still challenging logicians, mathematicians, and philosophers today.\" \nSTEVEN STROGATZ is the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Applied Mathematics at Cornell University. \nHe is the bestselling author of The Joy Of X, The Calculus Of Friendship, and Sync.

Norton; Proposal; 70,000 words; Delivery: February 2018] \nAdam Waytz is a rising star in the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, whose research \nuses methods from social psychology and cognitive neuroscience to study how people think about minds. Waytz \nis the first person to receive twice the Theoretical Innovation Prize from the Society for Personality and Social \nPsychology. He is also the winner of the SAGE Young Scholar Award and the International Social Cognition \nNetwork's Early Career Award. \nWaytz writes: \"Everyday life is increasingly human-free. Robotic technology has begun replacing human jobs \nand will replace millions more over the next five years. In domains such as manufacturing and agriculture, \nrobotic employees are already a reality. Tasks like getting directions from another human or consulting with a \nbank teller to deposit money have become obsolete. These advances contribute to well-documented declines in \nsocial interaction. Not only has interaction with human beings diminished, but existing human interaction has \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-13-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025159 \ndeclined in quality. People feel less trusting of others than in previous decades, face-to-face communication is \nless frequent, and people's social networks have become more fragmented, producing smaller social clusters \nrather than expansive, civic community groups. Empathy with other humans, considering others' wants, feelings, \nneeds, and motivations (the essence of what makes us human), has diminished considerably. Rises in income \ninequality and political polarization also mean that our diversity of social experiences—encountering people \nunlike 'us' —is diminishing as well, enabling little consideration of humans dissimilar to ourselves. \n\"The Power of Human represents a call to action. This book details the psychological cost of losing our \nhumanity and elucidates scientifically supported strategies to counteract this trend, many of which are already \nunderway. Although scholars have bemoaned declines in social interaction, their concerns often erroneously \ncenter on people's deteriorating social skills, communication abilities, and intelligence (for which evidence is \ndecidedly mixed). Meanwhile, the real costs of this decline on moral behavior, employee productivity, \nmobilizing social movements, and finding meaning in life have gone overlooked. This book elucidates how we \noften overlook how psychologically powerful humans are, and provides strategies to rejuvenate efforts to \nrecognize others' humanity. \n\"The Power of Human is unique in providing solutions to this problem that will help businesses retain customers \nand employees, help charities raise more money, help people experience greater significance from simple \neveryday activities, help technologists design better robots, help reduce conflict between different political and \nreligious sects, and increase happiness in relationships with friends and spouses.\" \nADAM WAYTZ is an associate professor of management and organizations in the Kellogg School of \nManagement at Northwestern University. His research has been published in leading journals such as \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and \nPsychological Review.

The term \"complexity\" can be misleading, \nhowever, because what makes West's discoveries so beautiful is that he has found an underlying simplicity that \nunites the seemingly complex and diverse phenomena of living systems, including our bodies, our cities and our \nbusinesses. \nFascinated by issues of aging and mortality, West applied the rigor of a physicist to the biological question of \nwhy we live as long as we do and no longer. The result was astonishing and changed science, creating a new \nunderstanding of energy use and metabolism: West found that despite the riotous diversity in the sizes of \nmammals, they are all, to a large degree, scaled versions of each other. If you know the size of a mammal, you \ncan use scaling laws to learn everything from how much food it eats per day, what its heart-rate is, how long it \nwill take to mature, its lifespan, and so on. Furthermore, the efficiency of the mammal's circulatory systems \nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist \n-14-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025160 \nscales up precisely based on weight: If you compare a mouse, a human and an elephant on a logarithmic graph, \nyou find with every doubling of average weight, a species gets 25% more efficient—and lives 25% longer. This \nspeaks to everything from how long we can expect to live to how many hours of sleep we need. Fundamentally, \nhe has proven, the issue has to do with the fractal geometry of the networks that supply energy and remove \nwaste from the organism's body. \nWest's work has been game-changing for biologists, but then he made the even bolder move of exploring his \nwork's applicability to cities. Cities, too, are constellations of networks and laws of scalability relate with eerie \nprecision to them. For every doubling in a city's size, the city needs 15% less road, electrical wire, and gas \nstations to support the same population. More amazingly, for every doubling in size, cities produce 15% more \npatents and more wealth, as well as 15% more crime and disease. This broad pattern lays the groundwork for a \nnew science of cities. \nRecently, West has applied his revolutionary work on cities and biological life to the business world. This \ninvestigation has led to powerful insights into why some companies thrive while others fail. The implications of \nthese discoveries are far-reaching, and are just beginning to be explored. \nScale is a thrilling scientific adventure story about the elemental natural laws that bind us together in simple but \nprofound ways. Through the brilliant mind of Geoffrey West, we can envision how cities, companies and \nbiological life alike are dancing to the same simple, powerful tune, however diverse and unrelated they are to \neach other. \nGEOFFREY WEST, a theoretical physicist, is distinguished professor and past president at Santa Fe Institute. \nHis primary interests have been in fundamental questions in physics and biology. West is a Senior Fellow at Los \nAlamos National Laboratory and a distinguished professor at the Sante Fe Institute, where he served as the \npresident from 2005-2009.

In Fundamentals, the ten basic propositions \nsupport a series of interesting and connected chapters, which give historical and cultural context, outline the \nevidence, and draw out the implications. I want the marketing of this book to be based on the following slogan: \n\"If you read just one book about science, this should be the one.\" \nHere are three examples of the ten basic propositions: \nBrockman, Inc.
