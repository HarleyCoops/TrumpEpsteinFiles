We were surprised at the market’s unbridled\noptimism in April 1 , since the tug-of-war between private sector profits and public sector problems has a long way to go. We\nchose the charts on the front page of our 2011 Outlook carefully; they were designed to show that equity markets were priced\ninexpensively, but were likely to stay that way, given too much stimulus in the East, and ineffective stimulus in the West 2 . We\nexpect a modest second half recovery, based primarily on US capital spending increases, easy credit conditions everywhere, and\na pick-up in industrial production in Japan. But the world’s structural problems are weighing on the private sector, and our\nportfolios are positioned for a single-digit year in credit, equities and hedge funds.\nSomething different this week. I was on the road seeing clients last week, and was asked “what should be done about job\ngrowth”. We are investors and not politicians, so my ideas 3 are not relevant. However, it seems to me that anyone involved in\nthe jobs debate should be required to read the article below, written after the prior deep US recession (1990-1991). It’s\nfrom George McGovern, one of the most liberal politicians 4 ever to hold office and run for President. His epiphanies after\nleaving office and running the Stratford Inn are worth considering as legislators contemplate additional job creation measures,\nand the broader regulatory environment in which the private sector operates.\n“A Politician's Dream Is a Businessman's Nightmare”, by George McGovern 5 , June 1992\nWisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late. (Justice Felix\nFrankfurter). It's been 11 years since I left the U.S. Senate, after serving 24 years in high public office. After\nleaving a career in politics, I devoted much of my time to public lectures that took me into every state in the\nunion and much of Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.\nIn 1988, I invested most of the earnings from this lecture circuit acquiring the leasehold on Connecticut's\nStratford Inn. Hotels, inns and restaurants have always held a special fascination for me. The Stratford Inn\npromised the realization of a longtime dream to own a combination hotel, restaurant and public conference\nfacility--complete with an experienced manager and staff. In retrospect, I wish I had known more about the\nhazards and difficulties of such a business, especially during a recession of the kind that hit New England just as\nI was acquiring the inn's 43-year leasehold. I also wish that during the years I was in public office, I had had\nthis firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have\nmade me a better U.S. senator and a more understanding presidential contender.\nToday we are much closer to a general acknowledgment that government must encourage business to expand and\ngrow. Bill Clinton, Paul Tsongas, Bob Kerrey and others have, I believe, changed the debate of our party 6 .\nWe intuitively know that to create job opportunities we need entrepreneurs who will risk their capital\nagainst an expected payoff. Too often, however, public policy does not consider whether we are choking\noff those opportunities.\n1 The Osama Bin Laden episode marked the equity market peak for the year. Some commentators saw this event as a basis for\nfurther optimism, but unsurprisingly, the positive glow lasted for only around 2.5 hours the subsequent Monday. According to the\nCongressional Research Service, over the last decade, the US has spent at least $1.1 trillion in war funding operations,\nsurpassing the constant-dollar cost of the Korean and Vietnam Wars combined. This highlights the disproportionately large\npain that small, non-sovereign entities can inflict in the modern era.\n2 So far, the large growth and employment multipliers from deficit spending estimated by Christina Romer (former Chair of the\nPresident’s Council of Economic Advisers) have not materialized. John Taylor and John Cogan from Stanford have been closer to\nthe mark: an initial boost, but then a rapidly fading benefit.\n3 I like the idea of extending the holding period for short term capital gains to 3-5 years, and cutting the long term capital\ngains rate closer to 5%-10%. It could encourage more business formation, since more of what people create, they keep. If the\ncutoff year is properly set, it could be done on a deficit–neutral basis.\n4 According to methodology described by Keith Poole of the University of San Diego in the American Journal of Political Science,\nMcGovern ranks as the 99 th most liberal politician out of 3,320 politicians serving from 1937 to 2002.\n5 In a letter to the Wall Street Journal. Reprinted with permission; emphasis added.\n6 This may not have been a permanent change. The National Taxpayers Union rated the Blue Dog Democrats as having a fiscal\nconservatism score of 52% in 1995; by 2009, it had fallen to 18%.\n1\nJune 14, 2011\nTopics: On lessons learned running the Stratford Inn\nMy own business perspective has been limited to that small hotel and restaurant in Stratford, Conn., with an\nespecially difficult lease and a severe recession. But my business associates and I also lived with federal, state\nand local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising\ntax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never doubted the worthiness of\nany of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: `Can we make consumers pay the higher\nprices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting requirements\nwith reams of red tape.' It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators 7 . For example,\nthe papers today are filled with stories about businesses dropping health coverage for employees. We provided a\nsubstantial package for our staff at the Stratford Inn. However, were we operating today, those costs would\nexceed $150,000 a year for health care on top of salaries and other benefits. There would have been no\nreasonable way for us to absorb or pass on these costs.\nSome of the escalation in the cost of health care is attributed to patients suing doctors. While one cannot assess\nthe merit of all these claims, I've also witnessed firsthand the explosion in blame-shifting and scapegoating for\nevery negative experience in life. Today, despite bankruptcy, we are still dealing with litigation from\nindividuals who fell in or near our restaurant. Despite these injuries, not every misstep is the fault of someone\nelse. Not every such incident should be viewed as a lawsuit instead of an unfortunate accident. And while the\nbusiness owner may prevail in the end, the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees is\nfrightening.\nOur Connecticut hotel, along with many others, went bankrupt for a variety of reasons, the general economy in\nthe Northeast being a significant cause. But that reason masks the variety of other challenges we faced that drive\noperating costs and financing charges beyond what a small business can handle. It is clear that some businesses\nhave products that can be priced at almost any level. The price of raw materials (e.g., steel and glass) and lifesaving\ndrugs and medical care are not easily substituted by consumers. It is only competition or antitrust that\ntempers price increases. Consumers may delay purchases, but they have little choice when faced with higher\nprices. In services, however, consumers do have a choice when faced with higher prices. You may have to stay\nin a hotel while on vacation, but you can stay fewer days. You can eat in restaurants fewer times per month, or\nforgo a number of services from car washes to shoeshines. Every such decision eventually results in job losses\nfor someone. And often these are the people without the skills to help themselves--the people I've spent a\nlifetime trying to help.\n7 Would McGovern’s focus on red tape make sense today? According to surveys conducted by the National Federation of Small\nBusiness, the answer would be yes. The 3 issues most frequently mentioned as each respondent’s “single most important problem”\nare Poor Sales, Regulation & Red Tape, and Taxes. Two things of note. First, Regulation & Red Tape concerns have been steadily\nrising over the last two years. Secondly, availability of credit does not show up as an issue. As the NFIB wrote in May 2011, “92\npercent reported that all their credit needs were met or that they were not interested in borrowing. Eight percent reported that not all\nof their credit needs were satisfied. Three percent reported financing as their #1 business problem, so credit supply is not a problem\nfor the overwhelming majority.”\nWhat's the largest problem facing small business?\nPercent of respondents\n35%\n30%\nTaxes\nPoor sales\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\nRegulation & Red Tape\n1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010\nSource: National Federation of Independent Business.\n2\nJune 14, 2011\nTopics: On lessons learned running the Stratford Inn\nIn short, “one-size-fits-all” rules for business ignore the reality of the market place. And setting thresholds for\nregulatory guidelines at artificial levels--e.g., 50 employees or more, $500,000 in sales--takes no account of other\nrealities, such as profit margins, labor intensive vs. capital intensive businesses, and local market economics.\nThe problem we face as legislators is: Where do we set the bar so that it is not too high to clear? I don't have\nthe answer. I do know that we need to start raising these questions more often.\nSo, there you have it, one of the more remarkable epiphanies in American politics: a paean to entrepreneurship and\ngovernment restraint from one of its most progressive members. Public epiphanies like this are rare, but there have been\nothers. Last year, Al Gore conceded that first-generation ethanol was “not good policy” given its low energy conversion ratios,\nand said he had supported ethanol out of “a certain fondness for the farmers in the state of Iowa because I was about to run for\npresident.\" 8 In 2008, former Fed Chair Greenspan conceded that his Ayn Rand philosophies regarding regulations and\nshareholder self-interest were flawed. Perhaps the most famous epiphany was from Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense\nand one of the principal architects of the Vietnam War. In 1995, he conceded that he was “wrong, terribly wrong” about the\nwar. George McGovern was one of the war’s fiercest opponents, saying on the floor of the Senate, “I'm tired of old men\ndreaming up wars for young men to fight”.\nThere may be no magic elixir of policies to speed the adjustment the US faces. Look at it this way: the US is trying the megastimulus\nroute, while the UK has accelerated its fiscal austerity program. Yet both countries are struggling with below-trend\ngrowth and employment. Perhaps after a debt binge, there are no easy answers, other than time. What to do next? McGovern’s\narticle suggests that an overly interventionist public sector may be the wrong answer, given the unintended consequences.\nUS and UK still searching for answers\nTotal household , non-financial corporate, federal and municipal debt,\npercent of GDP\n300%\n280%\n260%\n240%\n220%\n200%\n180%\n160%\n140%\n1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005 2008\nSource: Federal Reserve, Office for National Statistics.
