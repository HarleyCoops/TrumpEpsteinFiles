[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSent: 12/2/2017 9:16:25 PM \nTo: Larry Summers [ \nSubject: Re: A tax loophole for just Jeffrey Epstein? \nImportance: High \nComey himself acknowledged that: \"throughout history, some presidents have decided that because 'problems' \ncome from Justice, they should try to hold the Department close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately \nmakes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work.\" Comey has also \nacknowledged that the president had the constitutional authority to fire him for any or no cause. \nPresident Trump also had the constitutional authority to order Comey to end the investigation of former national \nsecurity adviser Mike Flynn. He could have pardoned Flynn, as Bush pardoned Weinberger, thus ending the \nFlynn investigation, as Bush ended the Iran-Contra investigation. What Trump could not do is what Nixon did: \ndirect his aides to lie to the FBI, or commit other independent crimes. There is no evidence that Trump did that. \nOn Sat, Dec 2, 2017 at 10:00 AM, Larry Summers < > wrote: \nLater \nSent from my iPhone \nPlease direct all scheduling inquiries to my office at: \nFollow me on twitter glhsummers \nwww.larrysummers.com \nOn Dec 2, 2017, at 9:50 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nOn Sat, Dec 2, 2017 at 9:30 AM, Larry Summers <___________________________> wrote: \nI don't know whether to laugh or cry \nSent from my iPhone \nPlease direct all scheduling inquiries to my office at: \nFollow me on twitter glhsummers \nwww.larrysummers.com \nOn Dec 2, 2017, at 9:29 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nlike the hunt for easter eggs. your friend andrew has so far only found one . and it was brighly colored:) \nOn Sat, Dec 2, 2017 at 9:23 AM, Larry Summers < wrote: \n???? \nSent from my iPhone \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026463 \nPlease direct all scheduling inquiries to my office at: \nFollow me on twitter glhsummers \nwww.larrysummers.com \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: Kelly Friendly <____________________ \nDate: December 2, 2017 at 8:16:13 AM EST \nTo: Lawrence Henry Summers < \nSubject: Fwd: A tax loophole for just Jeffrey Epstein? \nDid you see this \nKelly Friendly \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: Andrew Friendly \nDate: December 2, 2017 at 7:29:07 AM EST \nTo: Kelly Friendly <_________________________ \nSubject: A tax loophole for just Jeffrey Epstein? \n> \nhttps://wwwfacebook.com/senatorsanders/videos/10156545332157908/ \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
