Whether the idea has to do with politics, policy, \npersonnel or governing style, we're looking for suggestions that are specific and, above all, surprising; something inventive if \nslightly far-fetched is better than a pet cause or a well-trod policy proposal. (This exercise doesn't require that you support or \neven agree with Trump, but it does require a willingness to engage.) \nDo you have an idea along these lines that you wish the new president would consider, whether something in economics or \notherwise? If so, I'd love to hear, and we can discuss next steps from there. Ultimately, we're aiming to publish a handful of \nshort pieces (about 800 words each) as a package of proposals. \nMany thanks, and please let me know if you have questions. \nMargy Slattery \nDeputy Editor, Politico Magazine \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
