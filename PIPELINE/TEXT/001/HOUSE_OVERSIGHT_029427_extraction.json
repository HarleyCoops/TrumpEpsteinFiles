    "full_text": "﻿PRESERVING MONGOLIAN SOVEREIGNTY AND CULTURE\nMONDAY, JUNE 19, 2017\nThe sovereignty of Mongolia is under siege.\nThe People’s Republic China (PRC) regards Mongolia as its “Ukraine” i , ii . Covertly the PRC has\nambitions not simply to make Mongolia a client or puppet state, as it was under Soviet domination,\nbut to integrate it with the PRC through a “voluntary” referendum, just as the Russians engineered\nthe assimilation of Crimea in 2014.\nThis was Mao Tse-tung’s prophecy and intent once China could establish parity or surpass Soviet\nmilitary and economic might. iii\nAs the world’s attention is focused on China’s South China Sea claims, an asymmetrical war is also\nbeing conducted by the PRC to achieve Mongolian assimilation. Russian influence is being\nmarginalized, as are Mongolia’s ‘3 rd Neighbor’ partners such as Japan, South Korea, Germany, and\nthe US iv . China’s penetration and Sinification of Mongolia’s natural resources, financial system,\nbusinesses, infrastructure, media, social media, culture, religion, security, electoral system, and\npolitical body are each battle fronts in a multi-pronged asymmetrical campaign to isolate and then\nassimilate Mongolia v .\nPreserving Mongolian sovereignty demands a global awareness of the PRC’s covert intent. An\neducation campaign is needed both within Mongolia and globally to counter a) the PRC’s revisionist\nhistorical justification for claiming Mongolia as their Crimea vi and b) the PRC’s effort to isolate\nMongolia and control all aspects of Mongolia’s economy, resources, politics, and culture.\nWithout a counter-campaign Mongolia will in a decade’s time be assimilate and Sinicized like Inner\nMongolia and Manchuria vii . Mongolians will become strangers in their own land.\nChina’s assimilation of Mongolia will not only be a tragedy for the Mongolian people and the hope\nfor Central Asian democracy, but a threat to the balance of power in Eurasia.\ni In negotiations in 1956 between the Soviets and the PRC, the Soviet negotiator, Sergo Mikoyan, and CCP\nPolitburo member Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai, the Chinese hoped to connect the granting of Mongolia\nindependence with the question of Stalin’s “mistakes.” The Chinese requested the Soviets cancel Mongolia\nindependence in the wake of Khrushchev’s condemnation of Stalin’s personality cult. Liu Shaoqi drew a\nparallel between Mongolia and Ukraine. He declared that Mongolia was China’s “Ukraine”.

We have not yet requested settling this account!” The publisher of the\narticle writes that Mao makes this claim based on “the fact that many hundreds of years ago Chinese troops\ncame to these areas and that once the Chinese Emperor collected tribute from the local people.
