And that should prompt you to keep a close eye on your estate plans. \nMore inheritance headaches loom. \nThe American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was \nsigned into law in early January, established a \n\"permanent\" $5 million estate-tax exemption. The \nlegislation also set the same $5 million exemption for the \nfederal gift tax and generation-skipping transfer tax. \n(That figure is indexed for inflation, which makes the \n2013 exemption $5.25 million.) \nBut as Kelly Greene reported this weekend in the Walt \nStreet Journal, President Barack Obama's fiscal year \n2014 budget calls for lowering the exclusion for estate taxes and the generation-skipping transfer tax to \n$3.5 million (albeit not until 2018). The gift-tax exemption, meanwhile, would drop to $1 million. The \nproposed figures would be a return to 2009 levels and would no longer be indexed for inflation. \nAccording to the proposed budget, the changes — coupled with closing other \"estate-tax loopholes\" — \nwould raise $79 billion over 10 years. Which means that the only permanent thing about estate planning \nwould be efforts by financial advisers and tax attorneys to stay one step ahead of Washington's search \nfor revenue. \nTo be sure, the president's proposals are unlikely to be enacted in their current form. But Greene \nhighlights several possible changes that investors and families should watch for: \n\"Discounts\" could disappear. Currently, the value of a minority share in a business — when transferred \nfrom one family member to another — can be \"discounted,\" resulting in a tidy tax savings. The White \nHouse, in previous budgets, has called for limiting or eliminating such discounts to family members. But \nthe absence of that idea in the budget for 2014 could mean the Obama administration believes the \nTreasury Department already has the authority to change the rules — and simply will issue new \nregulations to do so. If that's the case, families considering such transfers might want to act sooner \nrather than later. \nGRATs could get watered down. A grantor-retained annuity trust, or GRAT, lets a person give a portion \nof an asset's future profits to heirs tax-free. (One popular use of GRATs: Passing along stocks whose \nprices are depressed.) Such transfers take place over a set time period — as short as two years. But the \npresident's budget would require GRATs to have a minimum term of 10 years, making these trusts less \n1 of 2 4/29/13 1:26 PM \n\f1 iiiii 6 avvu. inkJ1G cblalc-taA U1LLIS - cticore - IvntrKet Watett \nattractive. \nnttp://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2013/04/29/coming-soon... \nIndividual retirement accounts could get emptied faster. Currently, people who inherit IRAs and \nsimilar tax-deferred savings accounts are able to \"stretch\" their withdrawals across their life expectancy. \nThe budget proposal would require most beneficiaries — other than widows and widowers — to cash out \nthe accounts within five years. Already, Greene notes, some older adults whose wealth is concentrated \nin IRAs are considering moving the accounts into trusts to help their families keep up with, and follow, \nthe rules. \nCopyright 2013 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
