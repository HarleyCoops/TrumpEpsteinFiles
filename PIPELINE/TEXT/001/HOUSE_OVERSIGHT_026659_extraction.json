She recently emailed her former colleagues the \nfollowing idea: \nListen Up! The Republicans need to get the message from the majority of Americans that we value and need the benefits \nof Obamacare. Here's how we do that. \nOn January 23rd, everyone who feels that way (our numbers are legion) sends a note to Donald Trump with a simple \nmessage: \n\"Don't make America sick again. Improve Obamacare. Don't repeal it.\" \nOne envelope for every ACA supporter in your household...even if they are under 18 years old. \nJust that simple message. Put it in an envelope, and put a stamp on it. \nOn January 23rd, mail it to: \nPres. Donald Trump \n1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, \nWashington, DC 20500 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026659 \nCan you imagine the picture of 53 MILLION letters arriving at the White House by January 26th? It will be a mountain. \nThat image might help deter the Republicans from killing the most substantial improvement to American healthcare since \nthe discovery of Penicillin. \nDo it today! Drop it into a mailbox near you on Monday, January 23rd. \nPlease send this email to 20 (or more) of your friends, neighbors ann fellow Americans. Ask them to do the same. \nThis also helps out the US Postal Service, with about $20 Million of stamp sales. \nDon't send emails to Trump...they don't photograph well. \nI attached a document with the text so you can just print it and put it in the envelope \ncell \nemail: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026660 \n"
