    "full_text": "From: \nSent: \nTo: \nSubject: \nAl seckel \n12/15/2010 5:36:27 PM \nJeffrey Epstein [jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nResults \nImportance: High \nJeffrey, \nThe bats did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a minute ago. \nYou have only one negative article left on front page of google, which is \nthe Huffington Post article. The Huffington Post is extremely hard to \nmove, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads \nmassive new and original content it on a daily basis with posting from out \nside readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at the \ntop. If we were able to post original content to both the science and the \norg site (absolutely not a single word to this day by Jessica, just talk), \nwe would have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. WE \ndid manage to get rid of the daily beast article, which is now far \nremoved, inspite of their own efforts to keep it prominent. \nToxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you \ntyped in your name are also now removed. \nWikipedia was an important victory, as it will always be at the top of the \nsearch engine results. ow the head lines do not mention convicted sex \noffender or pedophile. Instead, Philanthrophic work, Epstein Foundation, \nPromotion of Scientists. We have stopped the hacking on your wiki site, \nand that was a major effor. Your wiki entry now is pretty tame, and bad \nstuff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful editing \nand wording has muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace \nthe mug shot and caption, and now has an entirely different photo and \ncaption. This was a big success. \nWe pushed the Edge all the way up to the front page, where it was \npreviously buried on page 5 of google search. \nWe have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also \nfilled with your material. \nAnd, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still \nnew, and subject to volitility, especially if new original content is not \nadded on a minimum of a weekly basis. I have been forbideen to add new \ncontent to the philanthrophic site as well as the science site, and \ntherefore, as a result our rating slipped down (still on the first page, \nbut would have liked them (and some of the articles to been able to push \nHuffington off page). We also helped with you images, and the first images \nthat come of you on a google search are not of your mug shot, etc. \nYour daily beast foe is still at it, and trying to promote her sites \nagainst you in the same way that we try to depromote you. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022216 \nAs far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I do not \nknow what you wish to do. Clearly, you have no interest in my continuing. \nAnd, I am not sure if you want to continue the project at all. If the \nlatter, and you stop, eventually it will just go into the way of entropy, \nand it will return to the old form. The major work has been done, but it \nneeds to be maintained. For it to get better results, it needs to have \nconstant input and supervision, and that means generating proper content, \nnot just editing and grammatical fixes. Writers need to know what to \nwrite. THe philanthrophy site is at the bottom of the page precisely \nbecause you have not allowed us to add any content to it, and as a result \nit suffers. \nYou paid Mike $2500, which he applied for the purchasing of his \nreplacement servers, but his fee of $7500 balance is now due if you want \nto continue. Please let me know what you want to do. I need to inform him, \nand if you are not going to use him, he needs to take on his other clients \nand devote his time there. \nThis needs to be contrasted with what we started with, which was a search \non your name, which had nine/10 very toxic prominent stories, and toxic \nWiki article and headline. \nSearch Results \n1.
