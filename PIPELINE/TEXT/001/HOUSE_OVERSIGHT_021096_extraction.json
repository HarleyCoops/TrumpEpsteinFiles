Once again, a reminder to send me your delicious scoops \nand tips at kiaPaxios.com or find me on Twitter at Pimkialikethecar. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021096 \nHot event alert: RSVP to our 2/26 event in NYC for interviews with NBA star \nDraymond Green, BBG Ventures' Susan Lyne, JPMorgan's Jennifer Piepszak, and \nEquinox CEO Harvey Spevak. \nTop of the Morning \nIllustration: Rebecca Zisser / Axios \nAT&T's proposed $85 billion purchase of Time Warner took another turn yesterday. A \nfederal judge hearing the Justice Department's lawsuit to block the deal denied a \nrequest by the telecom giant to disclose communications between Justice Department \nofficials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the White House about the \ndeal. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021097 \n• Why it matters: The ruling is a blow to AT&T's attempt to show that the \nlawsuit to block the deal is politically motivated by President Trump's antipathy for \nCNN, which Time Warner owns. AT&T says it wasn't asked to offload any assets as \npart of the deal until after Trump took office. \n• What they're saying: \"We respect the judge's decision and look forward to \nthe upcoming trial,\" said Dan Petrocelli, who is leading AT&T and Time Warner's \ndefense in the case, in a statement. \n• At a hearing on Friday, a Justice Department lawyer said that AT&T's \nargument for the documents \"didn't make sense.\" \n• Go deeper: Our report from the courtroom on Friday, when DOJ and AT&T \npresented their arguments. \nFund scoop: Niv Dror, who joined AngelList through its acquisition of Product Hunt \nin 2016, is raising a small early-stage fund focused on consumer products, multiple \nsources tell Axios. Dror declined to comment. \n• The fund will raise at least $1 million, though one source says it could go up to \n$2-3 million. \n• Like Product Hunt colleague Ryan Hoover's own VC fund, Dror's will be \nmanaged on the back-end by AngelList. \nSame old story: Yesterday, I grabbed coffee with Day One Ventures founder Masha \nDrokova, and heard a familiar—and still disappointing—story: While raising her fund, \nshe was told by prospective investors that she should get a male co-founder. \n• She initially considered the suggestion, she told me, before remembering it's \nrooted in sexism. \nSoftbank $$$: Softbank's Vision Fund is in early talks to raise additional funds from \nBahrain's sovereign wealth fund, Mumtalakat, the latter's CEO told Reuters. \n• The Persian Gulf has been a major source of funds for the Vision Fund: Public \nInvestment Fund, Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, and Abu Dhabi's \nMubadala, are already investors. \n• And it's not the only one visiting the region's investors—funds focused on tokens \nand cryptocurrencies have also been fundraising in the area, I'm told. \nUnicorn stampede: We're not even two months into 2018 and yet, seven startups \nhave already seen their private valuations cross the $1 billion mark—earning \"unicorn\" \nstatus—according to Pitchbook. Last year: 53. The word \"overvalued\" comes to mind... \n1-:77-3:7A \n1-:77-3:7A \n1-:77-3:7A \nThe BFD \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021098 \nPhoto: George Rose/Getty Images \nBroadcom has adjusted its takeover offer for Qualcomm to $79 per share, down from \nthe its \"best and final\" bid of $82. The move is a response to Qualcomm's \nannouncement yesterday it would pay $127.50 a share for NXP, up from the $ilo it \nhad offered. \n• Why it's the BFD: Broadcom and Qualcomm's takeover dance has taken a \ndramatic turn for what should have been a boring transaction between two chip \ncompanies. \n• Bottom line: \"Broadcom has long said its acquisition of the San Diego-based \nchipmaker is contingent on Qualcomm buying NXP at the previously agreed price, \nsaving a large amount of cash Broadcom could hypothetically use for its own purposes \nonce the acquisition goes through... Qualcomm raised its NXP bid to secure support \nfrom activist investors who have piled into NXP and demanded a higher sale price.\" — \nBloomberg. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021099 \nViva!, \nViva!, \nVenture Capital Deals \n• Moovit, an Israeli maker of a transportation app, has raised $50 million in Series D \nfunding led by Intel Capital, with participation from Sequoia, BMW iVentures, NGP, \nSound Ventures, BRM, Gemini, Vaizra, Vintage, and Hanaco. http://axioslink/fQSW \n• Vectra, a San Jose, Calif.-based cybersecurity startup, has raised $36 million in \nSeries D funding led by Atlantic Bridge, with participation from the Ireland \nStrategic Investment Fund, Nissho Electronics Corp., Khosla Ventures, Accel Partners, \nIA Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, DAG Ventures and Wipro Ventures. www.vectra.ai  \n• FourKites, a Chicago-based make of supply chain management software, has raised \n$35 million in Series B funding.
