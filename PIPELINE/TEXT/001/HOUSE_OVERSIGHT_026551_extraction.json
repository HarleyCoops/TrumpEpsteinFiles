One of his most outlandish scenarios -- still \nmocked by Iranians three decades later -- went like this: \nImagine you are a young man sleeping in your bedroom. In the bedroom directly below, \nyour aunt lies asleep. Now imagine that an earthquake happens that collapses your floor, \ncausing you to fall directly on top of her. For the sake of argument, let's assume that you're \nboth nude, and you're erect, and you land with such perfect precision on top of her that \nyou unintentionally achieve intercourse. Is the child of such an \nencounter halalzadeh (legitimate) or haramzadeh (a bastard)? \nSuch tales of random ribaldry may sound anomalous in the seemingly austere, asexual \nIslamic Republic of Iran. But the \"Gili Show,\" as it came to be known, had quite the \nfollowing among both the traditional classes, who were titillated by his taboo topics, and \nthe Tehrani elite, who tuned in for comic relief. Gilani helped spawn what is now a virtual \ncottage industry of clerics and fundamentalists turned amateur sexologists offering \nincoherent advice on everything from quickies (\"The man's goal should be to lighten his \nload as soon as possible without arousing his woman\") to masturbation (\"a grave, grave \nsin which causes scientific and medical harm\"). \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026552 \nPerhaps it's not entirely surprising that Iran's Shiite fundamentalists -- not unlike their \nevangelical Christian, Catholic, Orthodox Jewish, and Sunni Muslim counterparts -- spend \nan inordinate amount of time pondering sexuality. They are human, after all. But the \nsexual manias of Iran's religious fundamentalists are worthy of greater scrutiny, all the \nmore so because they control a state with nuclear ambitions, vast oil wealth, and a young, \ndynamic, stifled population. Yet for a variety of reasons -- fear of becoming Salman \nRushdie, of being labeled an Orientalist, of upsetting religious sensibilities -- the \nremarkable hypocrisy of the Iranian regime is often studiously avoided. \nThat's a mistake. Because religion is politics in a theocracy like Iran, uninformed or \nantiquated notions of sexuality aren't just confined to the bedroom -- they pervade the \ncountry's seminaries, military barracks, boardrooms, courtrooms, and classrooms. A \ncommon aphorism among Iranians is that before the revolution, people partied outside \nthe home and prayed inside, while today they pray outside and party inside. This reverse \ndichotomy is true of a lot of social behavior in Iran. For many Iranians, this perverse state \nof affairs is now so ingrained, such an inherent aspect of daily interactions with Iranian \nofficialdom, that it is no longer noteworthy. For those in the West who seek to better \nunderstand what makes Tehran tick, though, the regime's curious fixation on sex cannot \nbe ignored. \nTo paraphrase the late U.S. House Speaker Tip O'Neill, in the Islamic Republic of Iran \nall politics may not be sexual, but all sex is political. Exhibit A is the revolution's father, the \nlate Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Like all Shiite clerics aspiring to become a \"source of \nemulation\" (marja'-e taqlid), Khomeini spent the first part of his career meticulously \nexamining and dispensing religious guidance on personal behavior and ritual purity that \nranged from the mundane (\"It is recommended not to hold back the need to urinate or \ndefecate, especially if it hurts\") to the surprisingly lewd. \nIn his 1961 religious treatise A Clarification of Questions (Towzih al-Masael), Khomeini \nissued detailed pronouncements on issues ranging from sodomy (\"If a man sodomizes \nthe son, brother, or father of his wife after their marriage, the marriage remains valid\") to \nbestiality (\"If a person has intercourse with a cow, a sheep, or a camel, their urine and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026553 \ndung become impure and drinking their milk will be unlawful\"). As a young boy growing \nup in the American Midwest, I remember being both horrified and bewildered after \ncoming across these precise passages in a translated volume of Khomeini's sayings I found \nin our Persian emigre home. \nScholars of Shiism -- including harsh critics of Khomeini -- emphasize that such themes \nwere the norm among clerics of Khomeini's generation and should be understood in their \nproper context: Islam was a religion that emerged out of a rural desert, and the Prophet \nMohammed was himself once a shepherd. Whereas religions like Christianity and Judaism \nsimply declare such behavior to be sinful, Islam addresses them from a juridical point of \nview. \nThe underlying problem, says Islamic scholar Mehdi Khalaji, a former seminary student in \nthe Shiite epicenter of Qom, is not that such issues were addressed, but the fact that \n\"Islamic jurisprudence hasn't yet been modernized. It's totally disconnected from the \nissues that modern, urban people have to deal with.\" \nIndeed, Khomeini's religious prescriptions are often the butt of jokes among Iran's post-\nrevolutionary generations. \"I've never even seen a camel in Tehran,\" prominent Iranian \ncartoonist Nikahang Kowsar told me, \"let alone been tempted to have sex with one.\" \nIF THERE IS A DOUBLE ENTENDRE that aptly captures today's Middle East, it is \nthe \"youth bulge.\" The Arab world's median age is 22, Iran's is 27; Western Europe's, by \ncontrast, is near 40. High levels of Internet and satellite television penetration, with their \npervasive pornography, coupled with the region's youthful demographics, have \naccentuated the Muslim Middle East's fraught relationship with sexuality. \nGoogle Trends, which monitors searches from around the world, shows that of the seven \ncountries that most frequently search the word \"sex\" on Google, five are Muslim and \none (India) has a large Muslim minority. (The word \"sexy\" is even more popular among \nArabs.) Google Insights, another trend spotter, shows that the most rapidly rising search \nterm for Iranians so far in 2012 has been \"Golshifteh Farahani,\" a popular exiled actress \nwho in January posed topless for the French magazine Madame Figaro. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026554 \nBefore the 1979 revolution, religious fundamentalists were revolted by images of scantily \nclad Iranian women in the country's cinema and television; today, state television and \ncinema are forbidden from showing unveiled Iranian women. This is despite the fact that \nmost of the country's citizens have access to the much more tawdry fare on satellite TV \n(the dishes are officially illegal, but thought to be smuggled in by the Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard Corps itself). In the forthcoming documentary The Iran Job, Kevin \nSheppard, an American who played basketball in Iran's professional leagues, is shocked \nwhile surfing his newly connected satellite television. \"We have 600 channels,\" he \nremarks, \"400 of them are sex!\" \nBecause of its religious pretensions, however, the Iranian regime is forced to spend untold \nmillions of dollars trying to jam satellite TV broadcasts to prevent them from reaching the \ncountry's citizens -- a futile attempt to simultaneously repel the forces of both technology \nand human nature. In an interview with the New Yorker several years ago, an Iranian \nsecurity official candidly assessed the challenge at hand: \nThe majority of the population is young.... Young people by nature are horny. Because they \nare horny, they like to watch satellite channels where there are films or programs they can \njerk off to.... We have to do something about satellite television to keep society free from \nthis horny jerk-off situation. \nOne might assume a country that suffers from chronic inflation and unemployment -- not \nto mention harsh international sanctions and a potential war over its nuclear program --\nwould have better things to do than discourage its youth from masturbating. Yet the \nregime continues to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into Chinese censorship \ntechnology to create a moral Iron Dome against political and cultural subversion, with \ndecidedly mixed results. Piped-in BBC Persian and Voice of America television are \nsometimes successfully scrambled, but those who want pornography have no shortage of \noutlets. That said, the censorship software sometimes get a bit overzealous. One Iranian \nfriend told me of repeated unsuccessful attempts to access his British university's email \naccount from Tehran, only to realize that the school's apparently bawdy name -- Essex --\nwas prohibited by the regime's Internet filters. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026555 \nDURING THE RULE OF WESTERN-ORIENTED autocrat Mohammad Reza Shah \nPahlavi, Tehran was a rapidly evolving society that deceptively appeared to be crossing \ninto the modern age. My own family history is perhaps representative of Iran's urban \nmiddle-class trajectory during the 20th century: My devout paternal grandmother, born in \n1907, wore a chador and wasn't formally educated beyond elementary school; three of her \nfour daughters attended university, and all eschewed the veil. All of their daughters grew \nup in a Tehran in which miniskirts were the trend, and Googoosh -- Iran's pre-\nrevolutionary J. Lo (but remarkably modest by today's standards) -- was their main \n\"source of emulation.\" \nKhomeini's opposition to the shah was fueled in part by the latter's enfranchisement of \nwomen, which the ayatollah deliberately conflated with sexual decadence. In his 1970 \nbook Islamic Governance(Hukumat-e Islam° -- which would later provide the ideological \nand political template for post-revolutionary Iran -- Khomeini hyperventilated that \n\"sexual vice has now reached such proportions that it is destroying entire generations, \ncorrupting our youth, and causing them to neglect all forms of work! They are all rushing \nto enjoy the various forms of vice that have become so freely available and so \nenthusiastically promoted.\" \nKhomeini nonetheless reassured his liberal revolutionary compatriots -- just months \nbefore the revolution, while in Paris exile -- that \"women [would be] free in the Islamic \nRepublic in the selection of their activities and their future and their clothing.\" Much to its \nretrospective dismay, a sizable chunk of Iran's liberal intelligentsia -- both male and \nfemale -- lined up behind Khomeini, some even referring to him as an \"Iranian Gandhi.\" \nShortly after consolidating power, however, Khomeini and his disciples swiftly moved to \ncrush opposing views and curtail female social and sartorial freedoms. \"Islam doesn't \nallow for people to [wear swimsuits] in the sea,\" he proclaimed shortly after becoming \nsupreme leader. We \"will skin their hide!\" \nWomen who resisted the mandatory veil were met with violence and intimidation, \nincluding lyrical taunts of \"Ya roosari, ya toosari!\" (\"Cover your head or be smacked in \nthe head!\"). As Iranian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi recently wrote, \n\"Although the 1979 revolution in Iran is often called an Islamic revolution, it can actually \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026556 \nbe said to be a revolution of men against women.... The drafters of [the Islamic Penal \nCode] had effectively taken us back 1,400 years.\" \nLike Islamists in today's Egypt -- and some among America's Christian right -- Iran's \nrevolutionaries found fertile ground on which to play the politics of pious populism, rather \nthan concretely address the enormous challenges of building a diversified economy. The \ncountry's massive oil wealth made it appear all too easy. Khomeini famously dismissed \neconomics as \"for donkeys,\" and he responded to complaints of inflation by saying, \"The \nrevolution wasn't about the price of watermelons.\" Three decades later, the results are self-\nevident: In 1979, resource-rich Iran's GDP was almost double that of resource-poor \nTurkey. Today, it is roughly half. \nThe brutal reality is that Iranians had entrusted their national destiny to a man, Khomeini, \nwho had spent far more time thinking about the religious penalties for fornicating with \nanimals than how to run a modern economy. \nAFTER HIS DEATH IN 1989, Khomeini was succeeded by the current supreme leader, \nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, who has remained loyal to Khomeini's vision for Iran, including \nhis prudishness regarding matters of the flesh. For Khamenei -- who has said that keeping \nwomen in hijab would \"prevent our society from being plunged into corruption and \nturmoil\" -- outward displays of feminine beauty are viewed not only with religious \ndisfavor, but as an existential threat to the regime itself. \nKhamenei contends that the health of the family unit is integral to the Islamic Republic's \nwell-being and is undermined by female beauty. Although to some this worldview is \nfundamentally misogynistic,Khamenei sees men, not women, as untrustworthy and \nincapable of resisting temptation: \nIn Islam, women have been prohibited from showing off their beauty in order to attract \nmen or causefitna [upheaval or sedition]. Showing off one's physical attraction to men is a \nkind of fitna ... [for] if this love for beauty and members of the opposite sex is found \nsomewhere other than the framework of the family, the stability of the family will be \nundermined. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026557 \nInterestingly, the word Khamenei employs against the potential unveiling of women - \n- fitna -- is the same word used to describe the opposition Green Movement that took to \nthe streets in the summer of 2009 to protest President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's \ncontested reelection. In other words, women's hair is itself seen as seditious and \ncounterrevolutionary. Even so-called liberal politicians in the Islamic Republic have long \nfixated on this issue. Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, Iran's first post-revolutionary president, who \nhas spent the past three decades exiled in France, reportedly once asserted that women's \nhair has been scientifically proven to emit sexually enticing rays. (An Iranian satirist \nresponded with a cartoon showing a man inadvertently aroused while eating lunch at his \nfriend's home; the culprit turned out to be an errant strand of his friend's wife's hair in \nthe ghormeh sabzi stew, an Iranian national dish.) \nOVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, the women of Iran's younger generation have \nincreasingly pushed back and loosened their veils, but any discussion of abolishing the veil \naltogether is not tolerated by Khamenei. In addition to opposition toward the United \nStates and Israel, the hijab is often considered one of the Islamic Republic's three \nremaining ideological pillars. \"For Islamic Republic officials, the hijab has vast symbolic \nimportance; it is what holds up the dam, keeping all of Iranians' other demands for social \nfreedoms at bay,\" says Azadeh Moaveni, an Iranian-American author. \"Relax on the \nhijab, they think, and all hell will break loose; next people will want to swill beer on the \nstreet and read uncensored novels. They think of it as a gateway freedom.\" \nDespite Khamenei's assertion that the hijab prevents men from straying, governmental \npolicies in fact encourage the opposite. For example, to help accommodate the apparently \nincorrigibly wandering libido of the Iranian male, the country's parliament -- composed of \nKhamenei loyalists -- has supported sharia-sanctioned \"temporary marriages\" (known in \nPersian as sigheh) allowing men as many sexual partners as they want. The marriage \ncontract can last as little as a few minutes, and it doesn't need to be officially registered. \nThe man can abruptly end the sigheh when he likes, but initiating divorce is far more \ndifficult for women. Indeed, women who stray from the sanctity of their marriages do so at \ngrave risk -- dozens have been stoned to death in Iran for adultery. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026558 \nThe country's economic malaise has also led to a reportedly sharp rise in plain old, non-\nIslamically sanctioned prostitution. Tehran's high-end taxi drivers, often underemployed \nuniversity graduates, casually point them out on the street. \n\"When economies take a downturn, informal economies and illicit networks become more \nattractive,\" says Pardis Mandavi, author of a book on sexuality in Iran. \"Technology \nfacilitates this too.\" \nDuring the shah's time, Tehran's notorious red-light district was known as Shahr-e \nNoe (New City), a place where countless young Iranian men lost their virginity. Like many \nthings post-revolution, however, the Islamic Republic just imagined that banning the \nsymptom would make the problem go away. But pouring saltpeter from the minarets \nhasn't worked. \"They razed Shahr-e Noe thinking it would end prostitution,\" a retired \nIranian laborer once told me. \"Now all of Tehran has become Shahr-e Noe.\" \nUNSURPRISINGLY, THE OUTWARDLY CHASTE nature of Khomeinist political \nculture has perverted normal sexual behavior, creating peculiar curiosities -- and \nproclivities -- among Iranian officialdom. Omid Memarian, a journalist who spent several \nmonths in the notorious Evin prison for his articles critical of the government, told me \nthat his interrogators seemed far more interested in his sex life than his political \npeccadilloes. \"I tried to answer their questions in very general terms, but they'd interrupt \nme,\" he recalled. \"They wanted to know details. 'Start from when you were unbuttoning \nher blouse....\" In one instance, he told me, he was horrified when an interrogator \nappeared to be rubbing himself while listening. \nObservers of American politics -- the land of Jimmy Swaggart, Mark Sanford, \nand Newt Gingrich, to name just a few -- won't be surprised to learn that it is often the \nmost outspoken Iranian advocates of traditional values who fall short of achieving them. \nMemarian spent part of his mandatory military service in Tehran writing speeches for a \nsenior Revolutionary Guard commander who routinely attacked the craven immorality of \nthe \"Global Arrogance\" (i.e., the United States). \"His filmi [the person who brought him \nbootlegged films on CD] later told me that he always requested 'films with scenes' [film-\nhaye sahne-dar],\" a euphemism for porn. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026559 \nIn a well-publicized national scandal in 2008, the Tehran police commander responsible \nfor enforcing Iran's strict anti-vice laws, Reza Zarei, was caught nude in a brothel with six \nwomen (one of the women claimed he had asked them to pray naked in front of him). \nWhile American politicians might bounce back from such transgressions with their \nown television show (see: Spitzer, Eliot), the revelation of the incident reportedly led \nZarei to attempt suicide while in prison. \nThe shame of sexual malfeasance has been routinely used by the regime as a form of \npolitical coercion and intimidation. When the famously jocular reformist cleric \nMohammad Ali Abtahi, former vice president to Mohammad Khatami, was imprisoned \nafter Iran's contested 2009 presidential election, he surprised his supporters by confessing \nwith great gusto to being part of a Western-backed conspiracy to foment a velvet \nrevolution. Although his confession was undoubtedly forced, his close associates claim that \nwhat compelled him to confess was not physical or psychological torture but hidden \nphotos of him -- in flagrante delicto -- at a secret Tehran love nest that was long being \nmonitored. \nThe Islamic Republic isn't always so prudish, however. In fact, it's been willing to use \nsexual incentives as a form of statecraft. In a WikiLeaked U.S. State Department  \ncable, for example, senior Iraqi tribal chief Abu Cheffat confided in a U.S. diplomat in \nBaghdad that Tehran effectively wielded influence over Iraqi politicians -- ostensibly \nvisiting Iran for \"medical treatment\" -- by offering inducements including \"temporary \nmarriages\" with Iranian women. Not that Cheffat was complaining, mind you: The perks \nwere surely better than when he visited President George W. Bush at the White House in \n2008. It was not without reason, he explained, that Iranian soft power was trumping \nAmerican hard power in Iraq. \nMore recently, three Iranian intelligence agents who unsuccessfully tried to kill Israeli \ngovernment officials in Bangkok this past February photographed themselves at a bar in \nthe beach resort of Pattaya with local \"escorts.\" When I asked the scion of a powerful \ncleric in Tehran how ostensible devotees of Khomeini's religious ideology are able to \nreconcile frequenting non-Muslim prostitutes and drinking alcohol, he quickly dismissed \nany religious obstacles. \"There are government clerics who can easily grant them religious \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026560 \npretexts [mojavez'e Shar'i],\" he explained. \"They can make the case that if they didn't \nfrequent prostitutes and drink alcohol they would appear to be [terrorists] and raise \nsuspicions.\" \nIn essence, the Iranian regime's approach toward sex, like its philosophy of governance, is \nmarked by maslahat, or expediency, and used alternately as a tool of suppression, \ninducement, and incitement. In the summer of 2009, when hundreds of thousands of \nIranians took to the streets to protest Ahmadinejad's reelection, many protesters were \nbrutally beaten by the Basij militia, gangs of young regime thugs on motorbikes who were \ngiven a green light to quell the uprising. As Iranian-American academic Shervin \nMalekzadeh reported from Tehran, the Basij seemed to be driven by a combination of class \nresentment and pent-up frustration. \"They don't screw; they don't drink or smoke joints,\" \none of his sources told him. \"What else are they going to do with all of that energy?\" \nBut perhaps the seminal -- and most heartbreaking -- moment of the Green Revolution \nwas the murder of a 26-year-old female protester, Neda Agha-Soltan, whose bloody death \nwas caught on cell-phone camera and rendered one of the most viral videos in history. In \nan HBO documentary about her life, Neda's mother recalls a message that some \nsympathetic female Basij members relayed to Neda days before she was killed by a sniper: \n\"Dear, please don't come out looking so beautiful.... Do us a favor and don't come out \nbecause the Basiji men target beautiful girls. And they will shoot you.\" \nWhile the iconic faces of Iran's 1979 revolution were bearded, middle-aged men, Neda has \ncome to symbolize the new face of dissent in 21st-century Iran: a young, modern, educated \nwoman. For her opposition to the regime and to the hijab, she is the embodiment of fitna \nin Khamenei's eyes. \nTHREE SPRINGS LATER, the Iranian regime once again is faced with a crisis, this \ntime of an external variety. As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatens war \nin between meals, the Pentagon plays war games and policy planners huddle in the White \nHouse: Is the Iranian regime rational or irrational? Can diplomatic negotioations prevent \nIran from obtaining a bomb, or is an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities inevitable? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026561 \nMany Iran watchers assert that to persuade Tehran not to pursue a nuclear weapon, \nWashington must reassure Khamenei that the United States merely seeks a change in \nIranian behavior, not a change of the Iranian regime. \nWhat they fail to consider is Khamenei's deep-seated conviction that U.S. designs to \noverthrow the Islamic Republic hinge not on military invasion but on cultural and political \nsubversion intended to foment a \"velvet\" revolution from within. Consider this revealing \naddress on Iranian state TV in 2005: \nMore than Iran's enemies need artillery, guns, and so forth, they need to spread cultural \nvalues that lead to moral corruption.... I recently read in the news that a senior official in \nan important American political center said: \"Instead of bombs, send them miniskirts.\" He \nis right. If they arouse sexual desires in any given country, if they spread unrestrained \nmixing of men and women, and if they lead youth to behavior to which they are naturally \ninclined by instincts, there will no longer be any need for artillery and guns against that \nnation. \nKhamenei's vast collection of writings and speeches makes clear that the weapons of mass \ndestruction he fears most are cultural -- more Kim Kardashian and Lady Gaga than bunker \nbusters and aircraft carriers. In other words, Tehran is threatened not only by what \nAmerica does, but by what America is: a depraved, postmodern colonial power bent on \nachieving global cultural hegemony. America's \"strategic policy,\" Khamenei has said, \"is \nseeking female promiscuity.\" \nKhamenei's words capture the paradox and perversion of modern Iran. While dropping \nbombs on the Iranian regime could likely prolong its shelf-life, a regime that sees women's \nhair as an existential threat is already well past its sell-by date. \nKarim Sadjadpour is senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026562 \n"
