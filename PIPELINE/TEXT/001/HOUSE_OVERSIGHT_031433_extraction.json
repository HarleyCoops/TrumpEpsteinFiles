I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and \nthen heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am running the risk that you will \nreport my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be \ncomplete, as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading \nmy responses, I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to \ndistort them. \nIt is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading \nstatements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, \ncolleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which I am a part. I \ndo not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other \ninstitutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the \nopposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031434 \nme up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of \nwhich the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with \nwhich I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like \nCFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that their experience validates a trust in \nmy behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to their last 3 meetings \nto speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my \ntalks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to \nimpugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your \n'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than \nallegations and innuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and judge the facts in \ncontext. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me \nto meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. \nThe items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 \nwhere we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, \nand there were respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which \ninvolves an anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it \nclearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying \nthat because I decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The \nsecond part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who accompanied \nme on the cruise, and has attested to the fact that the claim is false. This is what I wrote at the time in response \nto the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. \nIt is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, \nRe item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came \nto me, asked me to talk over coffee, or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after \ngraduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested \nin going on to graduate school in physics, but she was interested in science communication so I told her that \nshe might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on \none of these occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member and \ndepartment chair I was interested in knowing what we could do, if necessary to encourage more women to go \ninto physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made \na difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have numerous \nrequests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and \non several occasions she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let \nher accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it, \nand I believe she found it useful. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and I see \nnothing wrong with this. I try to treat students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked when I later \nlearned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no \ninappropriate interaction but also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently \noffended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS \nconference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of \nrecommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her \noff at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, again in 2008, I expressed \nthat I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the \ncomplaint I was shocked and concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my \nconcerns and explaining the situation, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was \nrequested. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to \naccept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the \nUniversity, the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there— both among the faculty (many of whom in \nphysics I had hired while department chair)) and among the administration, along with a very attractive \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031435 \ncounter-offer by Case. Because I was already in Arizona at the later time I was asked not to have any further \ninteraction with the student I agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was \nbasically moot because I was not on campus. Following this episode, as indicated in the letter to the student, I \ndid assess what might have led to misinterpretations by this student, and became more careful in offering \nadvice when talking to students. I was also told by human resources that because it was decided to handle this \ninformally and not formally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no \nfurther complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would preserve its confidentiality and remove \nthe complaint from my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised and concerned that someone violated \nthat written agreement with you. \nRe item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University \nspecifically stated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the \nUniversity, and moreover that the 'outside complaints' were in fact related specifically to your item \n#6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual \nwho was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the \nalleged transgression. I was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the \nbasis of this but was told by both Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third \nparty complaints at private events unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was \ninvestigated by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university \npolicies had been violated. In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month, found various \ninconsistencies in the allegation, which suggest distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU \nreport. The initial complaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU until it \nwas dismissed, outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated \n\"It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the \ntime of the incident.\" \nAfter the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again \nmoot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report, from which I quote below absolved me of any \nwrongdoing, reinstating my position, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim and \napparent later claims: \n\"The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. \n- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly \ntouched in \nan unwelcome manner. \n- The conference attendee who took the `selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference \norganisers \nat the time of the incident (November 2016). \n- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference \norganisers \nat the time of the incident (November 2016). \n-The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. \n- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who \ntook \nthe `selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was \nrequested \nin the course of the investigation.\" \n(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request \nselfies not to include flashes, so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next \nhalf hour. Moreover, I have no idea if the other eyewitnesses you quote, who were not involved in any \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031436 \ncomplaint, were in fact there but this was a formal banquet with individuals and their partners, which I \nattended long enough to agree to sign things and do selfies before leaving early because I was tired. Even if I \nhad any such intent it would have been lunacy to pose for selfies in front of a group and openly do such a \nthing, including presumably in front of this person's partner, . Which, besides the fact that I don't do such \nthings, is one of the many reasons it never happened.) \nWhat makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, \nand when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, or sometimes aggressive. I am particularly \nproud of the way I work to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated, whatever their \nbehavior or request. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which characterizes all my \ninteractions with fans: to acknowledge them in a way that makes them feel appreciated and respected. As I \nunderstand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this \nyear, that behavior is what they will have witnessed and should report on. Moreover, I am proud of the \ninteractions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and \nethnicities. I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as \nresponsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally. \nOn Dec 10, 2017, at 6:12 PM, Peter Aldhous \nDr. Krauss: \nwrote: \nAs you know, I'm a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations \nagainst you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations \nin detail. \nIn particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 \nbelow). You claimed that \"both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and \nfabricated with malicious intent.\" We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious \nintent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. \nThe story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. \nI am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia \nHughes. \nOur story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). \nOur reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, \nArizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the \nCenter for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled \ncomplaints and concerns about your behavior during this time. \nOur story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and \neyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, \nstudents, and peers in the skeptics movement. \nI wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you \nwish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are \nplanning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. \nBased on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: \nIncident 1: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031437 \n• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a \nvolunteer for CFI D.C. \n• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked \nher if she was \"of age.\" \n• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. \n• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. \n• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. \n• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, \ndespite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. \n• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. \n• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and \ntrying to pull down the crotch of her tights. \n• She struggled to push you off her. \n• You said, \"When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you.\" \n• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said \"I have to go,\" and rushed out of \nthe room. \nIncident 2: \n• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it \nmust be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. \n• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student \nvisited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored \nthe questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. \n• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without \nmentioning you by name. \"There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought \ndifferently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me \nupset for weeks afterward,\" she wrote. \n• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, \nbased on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and \nshe did. \n• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. \n• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student \naffairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: \n\"This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment \npolicy. \n• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she \nremained at Case. \n11 \n• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics \ndepartment before setting foot on the campus again. \n• The letter also stated, \"Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also \nhis willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with \nstudents.\" \n• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the \nmonth before. \n• \"The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,\" \nyou told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031438 \nIncident 3: \n• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous \nincident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. \nIncident 4: \n• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists \nConvention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she \nwas attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. \n• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student \nand volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. \n• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. \n• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a \nmale friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. \n• You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2011. \n• You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the \ntable. \n• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She \ncrossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. \nIncident 5: \n• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were \ninformed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your \nfemale companion for sex in your cabin. \n• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged \nCFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, \nhowever. \nIncident 6: \n• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once \nagain. \n• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  \nNational Convention, where you were a featured speaker. \n• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. \n• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her \nright breast. \n• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. \"Don't do that,\" she said. \n• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College \nof the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your \nhand in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses \nhave confirmed the complainant's account of what happened. \n• In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your \nreputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 \nincident. \n• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National \nUniversity in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting \nappointments. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031439 \n• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But \nneither university found against you. \n• \"Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate \nthe allegations,\" Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. \n• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an \ninquiry \"did not find a violation of university policy.\" \n• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints \nof sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general \ncounsel, noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. \"The \nUniversity did not find either communication to state a credible allegation,\" Jewett wrote. \nMiscellaneous facts: \n• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort \nto understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. \n• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent \nessays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made \nwith biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public \nintellectuals. \n• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a \nvocal critic of President Donald Trump. \n• \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
