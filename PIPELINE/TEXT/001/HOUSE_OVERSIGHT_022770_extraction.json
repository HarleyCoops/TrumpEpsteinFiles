    "full_text": "From: \nSent: Tuesday, January 19, 2016 11:39 PM \nTo: Jeffrey Epstein \nSubject: Help! \nImportance: High \nBecause you were not available to meet me in person last year and at this point I don't need to be seen. I can not have press, media, \nprivate investigators, film companies, etc. contacting me or my parents and sisters at home or on cell/texts and or by mail. I realize \nyou don't have much control over this, but you can at least help me to move. I can't just get up and go like you. I left the city to \nescape, make a better life and I am devastated these people found me and brought to light an association of that I would rather them \nnever to know. People think I was involved with something really bad and I lost a boyfriend of great potential over this shit. I am still \nin debt over all these years, been working my ass off trying to get ahead, which you could never understand I was even surviving off \nthe pay I was getting. Well, its not any better. I dropped out of college because of you (and GM's) advice. Started working for a \ncompany you wanted me to and basically my life has has become hell since then. \nI have been your supporter for 16 years, the media explosion with Clinton, Trump and Cosby is affecting me. I'm not prepared for \nthis. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only \nthe use of the addressee.
