But I don't think it's my place to discuss her accusations of other people...I know nothing about it and never met her or Clinton. \nThe points I can legitimately address are the nature of my involvement with you and some smoking gun allegations by the other girls. I will talk to a lawyer this \nweek. \nIt could really be fun if I made a viral video that showed how easily people can be fooled, followed by a statement saying the stories are obviously false. If it's fun, \ntabloids may cover it... \nBtw, I was invited to go to Davos...does not seem like such a good idea at the moment \nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation©gmail.com> \nTo:________________________________ \nSent: Monday, January 19, 2015 7:13 PM \nSubject: your statement? \nI have to hand it to I'm sure she deserves the pretty penny she has made for her effort \n. She has certainly caught the imagination of a public hungry for salacious fiction. To suggest her \nstory is anything other than that, a fiction , is ludicrous. Presidents at dinner on caribean islands. ( \nclinton was never ever there, easy to confirm ). Sharing a bath with a Prince ( bathtub too small \neven for one adult ). sex slave being paid thousands of dollars. ( while at the exact same time, \nshe was working as a hostess in a burger bar ). being lent out to a prime minister though this prime \nmininster, never out of sight of his massive security detail also never visited the island„ sex on a \nsmall airplane with a famous lawyer while the other passengers must have been all looking out the \nwindow during the event . I would have thought that her fabrications were readilly apparent, but \nnow , being asked to deny what the press has termed her\" allegations\" is frankly silly. ok, to play \nalong I deny each and every allegation . The only person she didn't suggest she was forced to have \nsex with , was Bilbo Baggins. , maybe its in the sequel. \n1 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021823 \n"
