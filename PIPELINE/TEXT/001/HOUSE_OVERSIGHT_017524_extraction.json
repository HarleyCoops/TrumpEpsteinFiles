My first bet is a gradual change\nthat came about without headlines. When I was born in 1948\nwe were less than one billion children in the world. Today there\nare almost two billion aged 0-15 years. The game-changing\nevent in the first decade of this century was that the number of\nchildren stopped growing. Two-child families are now the norm\nfor 80% of mankind. The fast population growth will be over\naround 2050 and at that point only 10% of the 10 billion in the\nworld will live in what was the West. Demographics are major\nchangers of the market place.\nMy second bet is the G20 meeting in Washington 2008.\nAs the richest needed to borrow money they asked the emerging\neconomies to join and changed their name from G7 to G20.\nThe official photo of the heads of state tells the story. In the\nmiddle stands the host, President George W. Bush. On his right\nis President da Silva and on his left President Jintao and King\nAbdulla, most probably placed according to their ability to lend\nmoney to US in the time of crisis. We know of the lending from\nThe Royal Guards\nProgram\nSALSS 2012\nSaudi and China. But Brazil has on its own been lending US\nabout 30 billion USD per year since 2008. The economic\nstrength of the world is shifting.\nWhat do the ongoing tectonic shifts in demographics\ninnovations\nSwedish-American Life Science Summit\nStockholm, Sweden\nAugust 22 - August 24, 2012\nand economy mean for the future of frontline medical research?\nWill basic medical research be the last to globalize as it requires\na unique functional combination of venture capital, institutions\nand creative individuals? Or will we see tectonic shifts in how\nthe world does basic medical research already in the next\ndecade?\nO rga n i z i ng C om m i t t e e\nThe Museum of Science & Technology\nM/S Riddarfjärden\nChairman: Barbro C.
