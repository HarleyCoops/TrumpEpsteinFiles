This helps rankings. Also could you add it to google analytics \nusing Jeffrey's gmail account? This allows me to monitor it's progress and index it periodically. \nI'll call you later.

I'm going to have a few articles spun-off from it \nand put into lower tier publications as well. \nI want to push HARD in August with a premium placement, fresh link pushes, and some supporting \nplacements. We should be able to get down to 1 negative by mid-September with a goal of being clean by end \nof year (unless new negative press comes again...) \nFor social media updates... Are you currently doing these? I'd like to look at how often we are doing them and \ntrying to link to our own content more often. \nI'm also exploring if we can get this new site included in Google News and maybe syndicate other important \nAl news through it... would give us free google news spots when we need them.. \nJE - There's 3 negatives today and that's 3 too many. There will be progress please continue to be patient as \nyou have been. \nBest \nTyler \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
