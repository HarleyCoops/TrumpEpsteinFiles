Bush Senior which again is shocking, \nunbelievable, unacceptable... \nMr Michael Shrimpton & Mr David Dicke are worth watching if you haven't yet crossed their researching of public \nfigures that have (literally by reports) got away with murder. \nPlease find attached an image of Vitellius, pair of 19th Century Medici Lions (that are perfect for one of your estates), \nemperor Vespasian and a pair of Piranesi Engravings for your consideration. \nDo not hesitate to contact me should you require more details. \nWarm regards, \nYours sincerely, \nMark Green. \nCel. \nBEST WISHES TO THE THREE OF YOU!!! \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026609 \n----Original Message----\nFrom: mcgreenantiques ‹> \nTo: jeffrey <jeffrey@jeffreyepstein.org > \nSent: Wed, 21 Jan 2015 19:04 \nSubject: January 21: A Pair of 19th Century Carved Sicilian Marble Figures of the Medici Style Lions-\nDear Mr Epstein, \nHope you are well! \nPlease find attached images of: \nA POWERFUL AND IMPORTANT PAIR OF 19TH CENTURY FINELY CARVED SICILIAN MARBLE FIGURES OF LIONS \nIN THE MANNER OF THE MEDICI LIONS \nDIMENSIONS: HEIGHT 77\" - 196 CMS (INCLUDING PLINTH BASES) x LENGTH 39\" - 99 CMS x WIDTH 16\" - 41 CMS \n£160,000= RETAIL \n£120,000= TRADE Plus 5% Commission \nTHE LIONS REPRESENT 'GRAND TOUR SOUVENIR' WORKS OF ART AND WOULD HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONED TO \nDECORATE THE GROUNDS OF AN HISTORICAL HOUSE \nThe original figures were commissioned by 'Ferdinando I de'Medici' and were excuted by Giovanni di Scherano \nFancelli in c.1598, and accompanied by a mirror-image version by contemporary sculptor Flaminio Vacca (1538-\n1605). \nThe original pair remained in Rome until 1789, before being moved to Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, where they can \nstill be seen today. The two sculptures were hugely influential in eighteenth-century Europe: copies and versions can \nbe found from landscape gardens to mantlepieces \nThe figures are museum quality. \nThe lots are currently located in Barnwell Manor, Barnwell, near Oundle, Peterborough, PE8 5PJ. \nThey are the finest examples of 19th Century 'Grand Tour Souvenir' works of art of 16th Century sculpture outside of \na museum. \nShould you require more details please do not hesitate to contact me. \nYours sincerely, \nMark Green. \nCel. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026610 \nJeffrey Epstein VI Foundation \nChristina@jeffreyepstein.org  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026611 \n"
