Instead \nthe PM has been merely following the course of Obama, who, according to Bruno, does not know what he \nwants. Such an approach has weakened the influence of France on the international arena and has undermined \nits sovereignty. \nAlso watched some other videos of him - Bruno attacks Hollande for his tax policy and excuses him for \"not \nknowing what he is doing\".. \nOn Sun, Sep 22, 2013 at 7:39 AM, Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nhttp://video.lefigaro.fr/figaro/video/echange-muscle-entre-le-maire-et-fabius/2664796316001/ \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
