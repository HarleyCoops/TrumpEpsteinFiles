Two \nthoughts here, these guys seemed like idiots, pure Ruritania, and Bannon, surrounded by his own thuggish-\nlooking security people and whacky-bloggers advisors, thrives precisely because the world of populism is so \nunprofessional (if not farcical). \nmore later... \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030723 \n"
