We also thank the latter two institutions, as well as the China Policy\nProgram of the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University, for\nsupporting and hosting meetings of the Working Group.\nThis report has been a collaborative effort among a group of American scholars and policy\npractitioners who have spent long careers studying and engaging China, Asia more broadly,\nand a wide variety of political systems around the world. Each participant also has an\nabiding interest in protecting and strengthening democratic institutions in the United\nStates and elsewhere in the world. While different participants took the lead in drafting\nparticular sections of the report, each section was reviewed and contributed to by a number\nof participants in what became a truly collective and collaborative research effort. Our\ngeneral findings and policy principles represent a broad—though not necessarily complete—\nconsensus of the Working Group Participants.\nThis Working Group grew out of the Task Force on US-China Relations (chaired by Susan\nShirk and Orville Schell), and we thank the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the\nHenry Luce Foundation for their support of the Task Force.

It analyzes the\ngrowing challenge posed by China’s influence-seeking activities in the United States across\na number of important sectors of American public life. However, as we note throughout the\nreport, these influence activities are not confined to the US. Indeed, they appear in different\nforms and to different degrees in a large number of other democratic societies around the\nworld (in some cases more deeply than in the US). We therefore have opted to include in an\nAppendix short summary reports on China’s influence activities (and the resulting national\nresponses) in eight other countries.\nWe owe a particular debt of thanks to Kyle Hutzler, an MBA student at Stanford University\nwith significant experience in China.

To this end, and in light of growing evidence of China’s interference\nin various sectors of American government and society, we propose three broad principles\nthat should serve as the basis for protecting the integrity of American institutions inside the\nUnited States while also protecting basic core American values, norms, and laws.\nTransparency\nTransparency is a fundamental tenet and asset of democracy, and the best protection against\nthe manipulation of American entities by outside actors.\n• American NGOs should play an important role in investigating and monitoring\nillicit activities by China and other foreign actors. They should as well seek to inform\nthemselves about the full range of Chinese influence activities and the distinctions\nbetween legitimate and illegitimate influence efforts.\n• Congress should perform its constitutional role by continuing to investigate, report\non, and recommend appropriate action concerning Chinese influence activities in\nthe United States. It should update relevant laws and regulations regarding foreign\ninfluence, and adopt new ones, to strengthen transparency in foreign efforts to\nexert influence.\n• Executive branch agencies should similarly investigate and publicize, when\nappropriate, findings concerning these activities, with a view to promoting healthy\nand responsible vigilance among American governmental and nongovernmental\nactors.\n• The US media should undertake careful, fact-based investigative reporting of Chinese\ninfluence activities, and it should enhance its knowledge base for undertaking\nresponsible reporting.\n• Faculty governance is the key to preserving academic freedom in American\nuniversities. All gifts, grants, endowments, and cooperative programs, including\nx\nConfucius Institutes, should be subjected to the usual procedures of faculty\noversight.\n• US governmental and nongovernmental sectors should disclose financial and other\nrelationships that may be subject to foreign influence.\nIntegrity\nForeign funding can undermine the independence of American institutions, and various\ntypes of coercive and covert activities by China (and other countries) directly contradict\ncore democratic values and freedoms, which must be protected by institutional vigilance\nand effective governance.\n• Openness and freedom are fundamental elements of American democracy and\nintrinsic strengths of the United States and its way of life. These values must be\nprotected against corrosive actions by China and other countries.\n• Various institutions—but notably universities and think tanks—need to\nenhance sharing and pooling of information concerning Chinese activities,\nand they should promote more closely coordinated collective action to counter\nChina’s inappropriate activities and pressures. This report recommends that\nAmerican institutions within each of the above two sectors (and possibly others)\nformulate and agree to a “Code of Conduct” to guide their exchanges with Chinese\ncounterparts.\n• When they believe that efforts to exert influence have violated US laws or\nthe rights of American citizens and foreign residents in the United States, US\ninstitutions should refer such activities to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.\n• Rigorous efforts should be undertaken to inform the Chinese American community\nabout potentially inappropriate activities carried out by China. At the same time,\nutmost efforts must be taken to protect the rights of the Chinese American\ncommunity, as well as protecting the rights of Chinese citizens living or studying in\nthe United States.\n• Consideration should be given to establishing a federal government office that\nAmerican state and local governments and nongovernmental institutions could\napproach—on a strictly voluntary basis—for advice on how best to manage Chinese\nrequests for engagement and partnership. This office could also provide confidential\nbackground on the affiliations of Chinese individuals and organizations to party and\nstate institutions.\nPolicy Principles for Constructive Vigilance\nxi\n• All American institutions—governmental and nongovernmental—that deal with\nChinese actors (and other potential sources of inappropriate foreign influence) should\nreview their oversight and governance practices and codify and exemplify best\nstandards of practice and due diligence.\nReciprocity\nAmerican institutions are deflected from their purpose of increasing US-China\nunderstanding, and become distorted as one-way channels of Chinese influence, when they\nare denied access to China on a basis that is reciprocal with the access Chinese institutions\nare granted here.\n• The asymmetry of scholarly research access is the most glaring example of the lack of\nreciprocity. A whole variety of normal scholarly activities—including access to archives\nand certain libraries, fieldwork, conducting surveys, and interviewing officials or\naverage citizens—have been cut off for American researchers in China while Chinese\nenjoy all of these academic opportunities in the United States. Individually and\ncollectively, universities and other sectors of American democratic life should insist on\ngreater reciprocity of access.\n• US government public diplomacy activities are heavily circumscribed in China,\nwhile nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have encountered an increasingly\ndifficult environment to carry out their work. More reasonable reciprocity for US\npublic diplomacy efforts in China, relative to China’s activities in the United States,\nshould be addressed in negotiations between the two countries. In addition, this\nreport recommends enhanced American efforts to promote independent news and\ninformation, and democratic ideas, through US global broadcasting and efforts to\ncounter disinformation.\n• The US government should actively promote and protect opportunities for American\nactors to operate in China.\nPolicy Principles for Constructive Vigilance\nxii\nPolicy Principles for Constructive Vigilance\nIntroduction\nFor three and a half decades following the end of the Maoist era, China adhered to\nDeng Xiaoping’s policies of “reform and opening to the outside world” and “peaceful\ndevelopment.” After Deng retired as paramount leader, these principles continued to\nguide China’s international behavior in the leadership eras of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.\nAdmonishing Chinese to “keep your heads down and bide your time,” these Party leaders\nsought to emphasize that China’s rapid economic development and its accession to “great\npower” status need not be threatening to either the existing global order or the interests\nof its Asian neighbors. However, since Party general secretary Xi Jinping came to power in\n2012, the situation has changed. Under his leadership, China has significantly expanded\nthe more assertive set of policies initiated by his predecessor Hu Jintao. These policies not\nonly seek to redefine China’s place in the world as a global player, but they also have put\nforward the notion of a “China option” ( 中国方案 ) that is claimed to be a more efficient\ndevelopmental model than liberal democracy.\nWhile Americans are well acquainted with China’s quest for influence through the projection\nof diplomatic, economic, and military power, we are less aware of the myriad ways Beijing\nhas more recently been seeking cultural and informational influence, some of which could\nundermine our democratic processes. These include efforts to penetrate and sway—through\nvarious methods that former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull summarized as\n“covert, coercive or corrupting”—a range of groups and institutions, including the Chinese\nAmerican community, Chinese students in the United States, and American civil society\norganizations, academic institutions, think tanks, and media. 1\nSome of these efforts fall into the category of normal public diplomacy as pursued by many\nother countries. But others involve the use of coercive or corrupting methods to pressure\nindividuals and groups and thereby interfere in the functioning of American civil and\npolitical life.\nIt is important not to exaggerate the threat of these new Chinese initiatives. China has not\nsought to interfere in a national election in the United States or to sow confusion or inflame\npolarization in our democratic discourse the way Russia has done. For all the tensions in the\nrelationship, there are deep historical bonds of friendship, cultural exchange, and mutual\ninspiration between the two societies, which we celebrate and wish to nurture. And it is\nimperative that Chinese Americans—who feel the same pride in American citizenship as do\nother American ethnic communities—not be subjected to the kind of generalized suspicion\nor stigmatization that could lead to racial profiling or a new era of McCarthyism. However,\n2\nwith increased challenges in the diplomatic, economic, and security domains, China’s\ninfluence activities have collectively helped throw the crucial relationship between the\nPeople’s Republic of China and the United States into a worrisome state of imbalance and\nantagonism. (Throughout the report, “China” refers to the Chinese Communist Party and the\ngovernment apparatus of the People’s Republic of China, and not to Chinese society at large\nor the Chinese people as a whole.) Not only are the values of China’s authoritarian system\nanathema to those held by most Americans, but there is also a growing body of evidence\nthat the Chinese Communist Party views the American ideals of freedom of speech, press,\nassembly, religion, and association as direct challenges to its defense of its own form of oneparty\nrule. 2\nBoth the US and China have derived substantial benefit as the two nations have become\nmore economically and socially intertwined. The value of combined US-China trade\n($635.4 billion, with a $335.4 US deficit) far surpasses that between any other pair of\ncountries. 3 More than 350,000 Chinese students currently study in US universities (plus\n80,000 more in secondary schools). Moreover, millions of Chinese have immigrated to\nthe United States seeking to build their lives with more economic, religious, and political\nfreedom, and their presence has been an enormous asset to American life.\nHowever, these virtues cannot eclipse the reality that in certain key ways China is\nexploiting America’s openness in order to advance its aims on a competitive playing field\nthat is hardly level. For at the same time that China’s authoritarian system takes advantage\nof the openness of American society to seek influence, it impedes legitimate efforts by\nAmerican counterpart institutions to engage Chinese society on a reciprocal basis. This\ndisparity lies at the heart of this project’s concerns.\nChina’s influence activities have moved beyond their traditional United Front focus\non diaspora communities to target a far broader range of sectors in Western societies,\nranging from think tanks, universities, and media to state, local, and national government\ninstitutions. China seeks to promote views sympathetic to the Chinese Government,\npolicies, society, and culture; suppress alternative views; and co-opt key American players to\nsupport China’s foreign policy goals and economic interests.\nNormal public diplomacy, such as visitor programs, cultural and educational exchanges,\npaid media inserts, and government lobbying are accepted methods used by many\ngovernments to project soft power. They are legitimate in large measure because they are\ntransparent. But this report details a range of more assertive and opaque “sharp power”\nactivities that China has stepped up within the United States in an increasingly active\nmanner. 4 These exploit the openness of our democratic society to challenge, and sometimes\neven undermine, core American freedoms, norms, and laws.\nIntroduction\n3\nExcept for Russia, no other country’s efforts to influence American politics and society\nis as extensive and well-funded as China’s. The ambition of Chinese activity in terms of\nthe breadth, depth of investment of financial resources, and intensity requires far greater\nscrutiny than it has been getting, because China is intervening more resourcefully and\nforcefully across a wider range of sectors than Russia. By undertaking activities that have\nbecome more organically embedded in the pluralistic fabric of American life, it has gained a\nfar wider and potentially longer-term impact.\nSummary of Findings\nThis report, written and endorsed by a group of this country’s leading China specialists and\nstudents of one-party systems is the result of more than a year of research and represents\nan attempt to document the extent of China’s expanding influence operations inside the\nUnited States. While there have been many excellent reports documenting specific examples\nof Chinese influence seeking, 5 this effort attempts to come to grips with the issue as a whole\nand features an overview of the Chinese party-state United Front apparatus responsible for\nguiding overseas influence activities. It also includes individual sections on different sectors\nof American society that have been targeted by China. The appendices survey China’s quite\ndiverse influence activities in other democratic countries around the world.\nAmong the report’s findings:\n• The Chinese Communist party-state leverages a broad range of party, state, and non-state\nactors to advance its influence-seeking objectives, and in recent years it has significantly\naccelerated both its investment and the intensity of these efforts. While many of the\nactivities described in this report are state-directed, there is no single institution in China’s\nparty-state that is wholly responsible, even though the “United Front Work Department”\nhas become a synecdoche for China’s influence activities, and the State Council\nInformation Office and CCP 6 Central Committee Foreign Affairs Commission have\noversight responsibilities (see Appendix: “China’s Influence Operations Bureaucracy”).\nBecause of the pervasiveness of the party-state, many nominally independent actors—\nincluding Chinese civil society, academia, corporations, and even religious institutions—\nare also ultimately beholden to the government and are frequently pressured into service\nto advance state interests. The main agencies responsible for foreign influence operations\ninclude the Party’s United Front Work Department, the Central Propaganda Department,\nthe International Liaison Department, the State Council Information Office, the All-China\nFederation of Overseas Chinese, and the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with\nForeign Countries. These organizations and others are bolstered by various state agencies\nsuch as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the\nState Council, which in March 2018 was merged into the United Front Work Department,\nreflecting that department’s increasing power.\nIntroduction\n4\n• In American federal and state politics, China seeks to identify and cultivate rising\npoliticians. Like many other countries, Chinese entities employ prominent lobbying\nand public relations firms and cooperate with influential civil society groups. These\nactivities complement China’s long-standing support of visits to China by members\nof Congress and their staffs. In some rare instances China has used private citizens\nand/or companies to exploit loopholes in US regulations that prohibit direct foreign\ncontributions to elections.\n• On university campuses, Confucius Institutes (CIs) provide the Chinese government\naccess to US student bodies. Because CIs have had positive value in exposing students\nand communities to Chinese language and culture, the report does not generally oppose\nthem. But it does recommend that more rigorous university oversight and standards\nof academic freedom and transparency be exercised over CIs. With the direct support\nof the Chinese embassy and consulates, Chinese Students and Scholars Associations\n(CSSAs) sometimes report on and compromise the academic freedom of other Chinese\nstudents and American faculty on American campuses. American universities that host\nevents deemed politically offensive by the Chinese Communist Party and government\nhave been subject to increasing pressure, and sometimes even to retaliation, by\ndiplomats in the Chinese embassy and its six consulates as well as by CSSA branches.\nAlthough the United States is open to Chinese scholars studying American politics or\nhistory, China restricts access to American scholars and researchers seeking to study\npolitically sensitive areas of China’s political system, society, and history in country.\n• At think tanks, researchers, scholars, and other staffers report regular attempts by\nChinese diplomats and other intermediaries to influence their activities within the\nUnited States. At the same time that China has begun to establish its own network\nof think tanks in the United States, it has been constraining the number and scale of\nAmerican think tanks operations in China. It also restricts the access to China and to\nChinese officials of American think-tank researchers and delegations.\n• In business, China often uses its companies to advance strategic objectives abroad,\ngaining political influence and access to critical infrastructure and technology. China\nhas made foreign companies’ continued access to its domestic market conditional on\ntheir compliance with Beijing’s stance on Taiwan and Tibet. This report documents\nhow China has supported the formation of dozens of local Chinese chambers of\ncommerce in the United States that appear to have ties to the Chinese government.\n• In the American media, China has all but eliminated the plethora of independent\nChinese-language media outlets that once served Chinese American communities. It\nhas co-opted existing Chinese-language outlets and established its own new outlets.\nState-owned Chinese media companies have also established a significant foothold\nIntroduction\n5\nin the English-language market, in print, radio, television, and online. At the same\ntime, the Chinese government has severely limited the ability of US and other Western\nmedia outlets to conduct normal news gathering activities within China, much less\nto provide news feeds directly to Chinese listeners, viewers, and readers in China, by\nlimiting and blocking their Chinese-language websites and forbidding distribution of\ntheir output within China itself.\n• Among the Chinese American community, China has long sought to influence—\neven silence—voices critical of the PRC or supportive of Taiwan by dispatching\npersonnel to the United States to pressure these individuals and while also pressuring\ntheir relatives in China. Beijing also views Chinese Americans as members of a\nworldwide Chinese diaspora that presumes them to retain not only an interest in the\nwelfare of China but also a loosely defined cultural, and even political, allegiance to\nthe so-called Motherland. Such activities not only interfere with freedom of speech\nwithin the United States but they also risk generating suspicion of Chinese Americans\neven though those who accept Beijing’s directives are a very small minority.\n• In the technology sector, China is engaged in a multifaceted effort to misappropriate\ntechnologies it deems critical to its economic and military success. Beyond economic\nespionage, theft, and the forced technology transfers that are required of many joint\nventure partnerships, China also captures much valuable new technology through its\ninvestments in US high-tech companies and through its exploitation of the openness\nof American university labs. This goes well beyond influence-seeking to a deeper\nand more disabling form of penetration. The economic and strategic losses for the\nUnited States are increasingly unsustainable, threatening not only to help China gain\nglobal dominance of a number of the leading technologies of the future, but also to\nundermine America’s commercial and military advantages.\n• Around the world, China’s influence-seeking activities in the United States are\nmirrored in different forms in many other countries. To give readers a sense of\nthe variation in China’s influence-seeking efforts abroad, this report also includes\nsummaries of the experiences of eight other countries, including Australia, Canada,\nFrance, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and the UK.\nToward Constructive Vigilance\nIn weighing policy responses to influence seeking in a wide variety of American\ninstitutions, the Working Group has sought to strike a balance between passivity and\noverreaction, confidence in our foundations and alarm about their possible subversion,\nand the imperative to sustain openness while addressing the unfairness of contending\non a series of uneven playing fields. Achieving this balance requires that we differentiate\nconstructive from harmful forms of interaction and carefully gauge the challenge, lest we\nIntroduction\n6\nsee threats everywhere and overreact in ways that both undermine our own principles and\nunnecessarily damage the US-China relationship.\nThe sections that follow lodge recommendations under three broad headings. The first\ntwo, promoting “transparency” and “integrity,” are hardly controversial in the face of the\nexisting challenge, and they elicited little debate. Sunshine is the best disinfectant against\nany manipulation of American entities by outside actors and we should shine as much light\nas possible on Chinese influence seeking over organizations and individuals if it is covert,\ncoercive, or corrupting. We should also shore up the vitality of our institutions and our own\nsolidarity against Chinese divide-and-conquer tactics. Defending the integrity of American\ndemocratic institutions requires standing up for our principles of openness and freedom,\nmore closely coordinating responses within institutional sectors, and also better informing\nboth governmental and nongovernmental actors about the potentially harmful influence\nactivities of China and other foreign actors.\nIt was in the third category, promoting “reciprocity,” where the Working Group confronted\nthe most difficult choices. In a wide range of fields, the Chinese government severely\nrestricts American platforms and access while Chinese counterparts are given free rein in\nour society. Can this playing field be leveled and greater reciprocity be attained without\nlowering our own standards of openness and fairness? Since complaints and demarches by\nthe US government and private institutions have not produced adequate results, is it possible\nto get Chinese attention by imposing reciprocal restrictions that do not undermine our own\nprinciples of openness?\nThe Working Group, not always in unanimity, settled on a selective approach. We believe\nthat in certain areas the only practical leverage resides in tit-for-tat retaliation. This\nwould not be an end in itself, but a means to compel a greater reciprocity. The Chinese\ngovernment respects firmness, fairness summons it, and American opinion compels it.\nEach section of this report offers its own recommendations for responding to China’s\ninfluence seeking activities in ways that will enhance the transparency of relationships,\ndefend the integrity of American democratic institutions, and grant American individuals\nand institutions greater access in China that equates with the degree of access afforded\nChinese counterparts in the United States.\nOur recommendations urge responses to China’s challenge that will promote greater\ntransparency, integrity, and reciprocity. We believe that a new emphasis on such\n“constructive vigilance” is the best way to begin to protect our democratic traditions,\ninstitutions, and nation, and to create a fairer and more reciprocal relationship that will be\nthe best guarantor of healthier ties between the United States and China.\nIntroduction\n7\nNOTES\n1 Malcolm Turnbull, “Speech Introducing the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and\nForeign Interference) Bill 2017,” December 7, 2017, https://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/speechintroducing-the-national-security-legislation-amendment-espionage-an.\n2 See CCP Central Committee Document No. 9: http://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation.\n3 https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/china-mongolia-taiwan/peoples-republic-china.\n4 National Endowment for Democracy, Sharp Power: Rising Authoritarian Influence, Washington, DC,\nDecember 2017, https://www.ned.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sharp-Power-Rising-Authoritarian-\nInfluence-Full-Report.pdf.\n5 Several other studies have recently been published concerning China’s influence activities and united\nfront work abroad, including: Bowe, Alexander. “China’s Overseas United Front Work.” US-China Economic\nand Security Review Commission.

It is\nsometimes also referred to as the Communist Party of China (CPC).\nIntroduction\n8\nIntroduction\nSECTION 1\nCongress\nDuring past presidential administrations, the US Congress has generally served as a brake\non executive initiatives to “engage” China at the expense of other US interests that\nmembers have historically valued, such as maintaining good relations with Taiwan,\ninteracting with the Tibetan government in exile, and expressing support for human\nrights. When President Donald Trump assumed office in 2017 and actively began courting\nChinese President Xi Jinping, first at Mar-a-Lago and then at the Beijing summit, Congress\ntook a wait-and-see posture. But as his own ardor for a partnership with Xi cooled and his\nadministration became disenchanted with the idea of finding an easy new “engagement”\npolicy, momentum began to shift. Soon Congress was working toward one of the most\nsignificant reevaluations of American-China policy since the start of normalization fifty\nyears ago. And with the White House increasingly skeptical about the prospects of winning\nPresident Xi ‘s cooperation, a series of new initiatives began issuing forth from both the\nadministration and the Congress, suggesting a rapidly changing landscape for US-China\nrelations. What was telling was that this tidal shift now emanated not from Congress\nalone—where it had strong bipartisan support—but from the White House and National\nSecurity Council, the Pentagon, the Office of the US Trade Representative, the Department\nof the Treasury, and even the Department of State. As sentiment shifted away from hopes of\nfinding common ways to collaborate, a spate of new US policy initiatives began appearing\nthat suggested a sea change. Congress passed the 2019 National Defense Authorization\nAct, which sought to bolster US defenses against both Chinese military threats and\nChina’s influence-seeking operations inside the United States. Congress also passed the\nForeign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRMMA), which empowered\nCFIUS (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) to expand its oversight\nof foreign direct investment (FDI) from China. At the same time, members of Congress also\nbegan expressing ever more strenuous opposition to Chinese nonreciprocal practices in\ntrade and investment, such as: putting whole sectors of the Chinese economy out-of-bounds\nto American investors; using Chinese companies to buy into sensitive high-tech areas of\nthe US economy through mergers and acquisitions; and making the transfer of American\nadvanced technology to Chinese partners the price of American companies being given\naccess to Chinese markets. Congressional concern rose over Beijing’s continued expansion\ninto and militarization of the South China Sea; the predatory lending practices that can be\ninvolved in President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative; and Beijing’s continued\npersecution of Taiwan and opposition to US support for the island.\nThis section reviews highlights of Chinese government’s efforts to influence the US Congress\nsince the start of the normalization process in 1972. As suggested above, because it has\n10\nviewed such “engagement” as too often taking place at the expense of more important\ninterests, the Congress has usually been more wary than the White House of allowing hopes\nfor a more positive US-China relations to determine our policy. At times, such as during\nthe passage of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979 and in reaction to the Chinese crackdown\naround Tiananmen Square in 1989, Congress has actively resisted the White House and\nsought to turn American policy in directions both the Chinese leadership and the US\nadministration have opposed. However, often Congress has played a somewhat passive role,\nespecially in recent years. Still, the control it formally exercises over US government budget\noutlays, legislation, and the approval of appointments of senior administration officials\nmakes Congress not only important in the formation of US-China policy but also a prime\ntarget for Chinese influence efforts.\nBy providing historical background, the review that follows informs contemporary US\nconcerns about Chinese government efforts to influence American leaders and public\nopinion. The record over the past four decades shows some success in Chinese efforts to\nwin influence over congressional opinion. However, more often than not, whatever positive\nresults they have won have not lasted in the face of enduring differences between the two\ncountries.\nCongressional Visits to China, 1972–1977\nPresident Nixon’s second term featured the Watergate scandal, which forced his resignation\nin 1974 and resulted in a lull in high-level communication with China. This circumstance\ngave more prominence to the reports issued by the approximately eighty members of\nCongress who traveled to China in the period between President Nixon’s visit in 1972\nand the start of the Carter administration in January 1977. The visits of these congressional\ndelegations—including (repeatedly) top leaders from both parties—were by far the most\nactive channel of high-level communications between the United States and the PRC during\nthis time. And most of the members who went to China wrote reports that were published\nas official documents. At the time, these congressional reports, as well as the media’s\ncoverage of their visits, became important vehicles through which American congressional\nleaders voiced their views and opinions on domestic Chinese politics and on Sino-American\nrelations, both of which were having an increasingly important impact on American\ninterests in Asia and the world.\nBy and large, these American visitors were pleased by the post-1972 developments in\nUS-China relations, seeing them as likely to be both a source of strategic leverage against\nthe Soviet Union and a stabilizing influence in Asian affairs. The government in Beijing\nwas seen as preoccupied with domestic affairs, no longer opposed to the presence of\nAmerican forces in East Asia, and anxious to work with the United States and other\nnoncommunist countries to offset Soviet pressure against China. The Americans saw the\nTaiwan question as the main impediment to improved bilateral relations, but they differed\nCongress\n11\non how the United States should deal with the problem. Although most members of\nCongress accepted the Ford administration’s cautious approach to China as wise, many were\ncircumspect about the merits of China’s political, economic, social, and value systems, then\nexperiencing the last turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and the decline and death of Mao\nZedong in 1976.\nThese congressional visits to China seemed to help the Chinese government improve its\nstanding with Congress and favorably influence American public opinion. The resulting\nreports show how granting these delegations access to China’s leaders and elements of\nChinese society that Beijing wished to highlight proved an effective strategy of calming\ntensions. And the costs for Beijing were limited to modest in-country expenses, since\nthe members usually traveled as official congressional delegations on US government\naircraft.\nOne notable feature of this historical episode was the remarkable role played by Senate\nMajority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-MT). Senator Mansfield was widely consulted in\nWashington as an Asian affairs expert, meaning his observations arguably had more\ninfluence than those of other members. He visited China three times during this period,\npublishing separate reports with detailed assessments of various issues of concern to\nAmericans at the time. In the main, his reports conveyed information and opinions that\nconformed with Chinese interests. Unlike many other members favoring a more cautious\npace of normalization with China and sustained ties with Taiwan, Senator Mansfield urged\nthe United States to promptly end ties with Taiwan and accept Beijing’s conditions for\nnormal diplomatic relations, warning that to do otherwise would lead to dangerous friction\nin Sino-American relations and instability in Asia. Senator Mansfield portrayed China as a\npower with fundamentally peaceful motives in international affairs and placed much of the\nblame on the United States for past Sino-American conflicts in Asia. He also contradicted\nthose members who worried that China’s leadership change could lead to internal struggles\naffecting China’s international and domestic policies. He insisted that such skepticism was\nunwarranted, because what he called the Maoist system had been effectively inculcated\namong the Chinese people. Some members complained that the limited itinerary for\ncongressional visits that was furnished by Chinese hosts did not provide a basis for any\nmeaningful assessment of conditions there. Despite the fact that many congressional\nvisitors questioned how durable China’s Maoist regime was and how lasting China’s\ncooperation with the United States would actually prove to be, Mansfield countered that\nhe had had enough opportunity during his three visits to the PRC to move about and\nobtain enough information through on-the-spot observation and talks with PRC leaders\nto conclude that it was no passing phenomenon. So, while many members thought the\nPRC’s system of indoctrination and control to be repressive politically, economically, and\nsocially—an affront to the human rights and dignity of its people—voices like Mansfield’s\nserved to mute the criticism, maintaining that the country’s political, economic, and social\nsystem was uniquely well suited to the Chinese people.\nSection 1\n12\nInfluence Efforts after Establishing Official Relations, 1979–1988\nAs the Carter administration began moving toward full diplomatic recognition of the\nPRC, it withheld many of the details about its plans from Congress. One of the largest\nunresolved issues was the fate of Taiwan, in which Congress took a special interest. The\nUnited States had already dropped recognition of Taiwan at the United Nations, and now\nmany in Congress worried that the United States would move to completely abandon the\nisland. In response, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, which underlined\nthe importance of the United States keeping an ongoing relationship with Taiwan and\ncontinuing to provide weapons for its defense.\nAfter formal diplomatic relations were reestablished, China responded in the 1980s by\nexpanding the size and capacity of its Washington embassy staff dedicated to dealing with\nCongress. Chinese officials lobbying Congress viewed with dismay the rise of pro-Taiwan\nindependence groups among Taiwanese Americans, such as the Formosan Association\nfor Public Affairs, which demonstrated an ability to promote their agenda despite the\nfact that the United States had broken ties with Taiwan. Beijing would go on to borrow a\npage from the Nationalist government’s playbook by beefing up a diplomatic arm capable\nof building closer relations with important congressional members and staffers. 1 Since\nthen, the Chinese government has welcomed numerous US delegations composed of both\ncongressional members and staffers. The main host in China for such delegations has been\nthe Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA). 2 Founded in December 1949, this\norganization focuses on international issues and foreign policy research and on conducting\ninternational exchanges of officials and expanding people-to-people diplomatic activities.\nThis institute also works to establish contacts with foreign political activists, diplomats,\nand other distinguished individuals while organizing public lectures and symposiums on\nacademic subjects and international policy affairs.\nCPIFA is a so-called united front organization, similar to those found in the former Soviet\nUnion and other Leninist states that seek to opportunistically build alliances wherever\nthey can. Such organizations, or GONGOs (“government-organized non-governmental\norganizations”), carry out government-directed policies and cooperative initiatives with\ninfluential foreigners without being perceived as a formal part of the Chinese government.\nCPIFA’s experience in dealing with foreign visitors is broad. Between 1972 and 2002, it\nhosted more than four thousand leading Americans in China. Being well connected with\nthe Chinese government’s State Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is positioned\nto organize meetings with high-level officials when the Party deems it in its interest to do\nso. The funding arrangements for congressional staff delegations visiting China usually\nprovide for their travel to be paid by the US side, so as to avoid falling victim to ethics\ncommittees and overseers or violating rules regarding conflicts of interest and foreign\nlobbying. CPIFA often assumed in-country expenses.\nCongress\n13\nThe staff delegation trips to China were welcomed and sought after by congressional staff\nand congressional support agency personnel, mainly from the Congressional Research\nService of the Library of Congress, which had a growing interest in China and the issues\nit posed for US policy. The trips generally came twice per year and involved meetings with\nChinese government officials and others responsible for key foreign affairs and domestic\nissues of interest to the Congress. The exchanges in these meetings were generally cordial\nand substantive, although the trips also included sightseeing and visits to parts of China of\ninterest to the Congress.\nIn the United States, there have been a number of counterpart groups that have facilitated\ncongressional exchanges. Among them are the Washington, DC-based US-Asia Institute\n(USAI), which has played a leading role in managing the congressional staff delegations\nside since 1985. 3 The National Committee on US-China Relations did a pilot congressional\nstaff delegation visit to China in 1976 and resumed involvement with such exchanges\nagain during the past decade. 4 In the 1980s, the Asia-Pacific Exchange Foundation (also\nknown as the Far East Studies Institute) also managed a number of congressional staff\ndelegations to China, while the US-Asia Institute has, since 1985, coordinated over\n120 such delegations and exchanges to China. These visits have been done in cooperation\nwith the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA) and the Better Hong Kong\nFoundation (BHKF). But the National People’s Congress (NPC) has perhaps hosted the\nmost trips, taking over a thousand congressional staff members to China. In these trips,\nmembers have traveled to nearly every corner of China, including Xinjiang and Tibet. In\ntheir discussions, they have covered a wide range of themes important to the US-China\nrelationship. Staffers participating in such trips have clearly advanced their understanding\nof Chinese developments.\nCongress and Turmoil in US-China Relations, 1989–2001\nThe number of the congressional staff delegations to China slowed following the collapse\nof congressional support for engagement with China after the Tiananmen crackdown in\n1989. Congressional anger and the impulse to punish the Chinese government overrode\npast interest in constructive engagement. As a result, Beijing began relying more heavily on\nthe US business community and its organizations, notably the Emergency Committee for\nAmerican Trade, to persuade Congress not to end the most-favored nation tariff treatment\nfor Chinese imports. The Chinese embassy and various lobbyists who were, or at least\nclaimed to be, supported by the Chinese government also tried to limit the damage by\nseeking to convince congressional members that conditions in China were much better\nthere than were depicted in American media at the time. 5\nBased on the reputation of its past efforts, the US-Asia Institute, presumably with\nthe encouragement of its Chinese counterparts, strove to resume the staff dialogues\nand attracted a wide range of senior staff and support personnel, including some of\nSection 1\n14\nthose working for the harshest congressional critics of China’s crackdown. One trip in\nDecember 1989 featured very heated debates with Chinese officials, especially after it\nwas announced that National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of\nState Lawrence Eagleburger were also in Beijing for talks with Chinese leaders and that\nthe two had made an earlier secret trip in July, soon after the crackdown. As the Bush\nadministration had publicly promised Congress that all such contacts would end, the staff\ndelegates’ anger at and criticism of China’s repression was compounded by their harsh\nreaction to the Bush administration’s actions.\nAs US-China relations continued during a tumultuous post-Tiananmen crackdown period,\nCongress played important roles on such key issues as the debate over most-favored nation\ntariff treatment, the visit of Taiwan’s president to the United States in 1995, and the decision\nto approve China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. The Chinese government\nendeavored to build influence with and gain access to Congress by encouraging US\nbusinesses to lobby Congress on China’s behalf and by continuing to receive member and\nstaff delegations in China.\nOther entities in the Chinese official structure, including the Chinese Communist Party\nand the Chinese military, at times attempted to gain access to Congress. The International\nDepartment of the Chinese Communist Party engaged in growing exchanges with the\nmajor American political parties on a party-to-party basis. A Chinese “united front”\norganization, the Chinese Association for International Understanding (CAIFU), managed\nsome of these ensuing trips. Also involved was the China Association for International\nFriendly Contact (CAIFC). This “united front” organization’s link to the Chinese\ngovernment was not then well known, though in recent years it has been publicly linked\nto the People’s Liberation Army’s Political Warfare Department, which has intelligence\nresponsibilities. 6 Meanwhile, other exchanges with US congressional specialists on China\nwere promoted by a mysterious “united front” operative with excellent official contacts\nin China named Jimmy Wong. In this troubled decade, Wong made himself known to a\nwide range of Americans playing a role in China policy as having the ability to set up visits\nto China and meetings with key officials very quickly. He occasionally even opened his\nspacious Beijing home to congressional staffers. His precise affiliation with the Chinese\nauthorities remains obscure. 7\nThe approaches of the Chinese government to gain influence and gather information\nabroad differ from the tradecraft of Russia and the former Soviet Union. 8 Notably, the\nChinese focus more on individuals rather than effects, and on shaping the personal\ncontext rather than operational tricks. It is person-to-person relationships that carry the\nweight of Chinese information operations. Working on these personal ties, the Chinese\nauthorities focus on facilitating meetings and contacts that may or may not result in\nopportunities to influence foreign targets. Still, because Chinese influence seeking is\nlargely a governmental undertaking, it is hardly surprising that the Chinese mix influence\nCongress\n15\noperations with espionage. In one instance, after a visit to China supported by CAIFC, an\nAmerican congressional official was asked by two employees at CAIFC who facilitated his\ntrip to host them during a return visit to Washington. He obliged, and they were seemingly\nsatisfied, having shopped extensively during their stay. Subsequently, the Chinese embassy\nofficers who had arranged the congressional official’s visit to China with CAIFC were\narrested and expelled for trying to steal US weapons technology, causing the US official to\nend all contact with CAIFC.\nCurrent Era\nTensions in US-China relations subsided after the terrorist attack on America in September\n2001 and subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq preoccupied the Bush administration\nand Congress. Chinese and American leaders also proved to be sufficiently pragmatic to\nreach common ground on advancing relations in mutually agreeable ways and managing\ndifferences through a wide range of dialogues. Such exchanges only catalyzed visits by\nmore congressional members and staff delegations visits to China. At this time, members\noften traveled to China in US government–funded trips as guests of the US embassy. Some\nmember trips and very frequent staff delegation visits were authorized under provisions\nof the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act (MECEA) that were in line with the\nguidance of congressional ethics committees. 9 In addition to the work of the US-Asia\nInstitute, those organizing and facilitating staff delegations grew to include the Aspen\nInstitute, the National Committee on US-China Relations, and the US-China Policy\nFoundation. 10\nChina also increased its own capacity to engage Congress beyond trips. Having moved into\na new embassy in Washington in 2009, the Chinese embassy increased its congressional\naffairs staff to twelve (as of 2011), while also retaining the lobbying services of the firm\nPatton Boggs. 11 During his time as ambassador, Zhou Wenzhong boasted that he had visited\nsome one hundred members of Congress in their home districts. When certain measures,\nsuch as a bill that would have penalized China for being a “currency manipulator,” came\nbefore Congress, the embassy’s in-house team’s efforts reflected what some US officials\ncalled a much more “nuanced” and “sophisticated” understanding of the body. Whether or\nnot Chinese officials or lobbyists interacting with congressional offices endeavored to exert\ninfluence by means beyond persuasion—such as by offering material benefits or threatening\nto withdraw Chinese investments or other tangible benefits to the congressional district—\nremained hard to discern given the very limited public reporting on such matters. 12\nCongress, for its part, had already formalized efforts to better understand China through\na variety of working groups. By 2006, both the House and the Senate had formed a\nUS-China Inter-Parliamentary Exchange Group, which conducted periodic exchanges with\nChina’s National People’s Congress. Also showing stronger American interest in China at\nthat time were the Congressional China Caucus (led by members tending to be critical\nSection 1\n16\nof China); the China Working Group (led by members supportive of closer engagement\nwith China); and the Senate China Working Group (led by members supportive of closer\nrelations). Earlier legislation had established the Congressional-Executive Commission\non China, focused on human rights conditions in China (a perennial negative aspect\nin US‐China relations), and the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission,\nwhich was known for its annual report listing a variety of developments in China seen\nas adverse to US interests and values. While the latter two commissions continue to be\nactive, are robust, and have growing impact, many of the other exchange mechanisms\nhave proven less than durable. Once the leading members who founded such groups leave\nCongress, interest usually wanes. The National People’s Congress became even more active\nin supporting the growing number of congressional staff delegations to China during\nthis period. In 2018, the House China Working Group remained active, but the House\nCongressional China Caucus and the Senate China Working Group were inactive.\nMost recently, the 115th Congress has actively embraced the Trump administration’s view\nthat China has benefited more from the bilateral relationship than has the United States.\nIn fact, amidst all the partisan warfare currently dividing Republicans and Democrats in\nWashington, a skepticism about China’s intentions and reliability and a willingness to\npush back in a bipartisan manner against its un-reciprocal, and sometimes even predatory,\npolicies, is one of the most surprising phenomena. In 2018, for example, the Congress\nunanimously passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages the Trump administration to\nhost more high-ranking officials from Taiwan, a move that angered Beijing. Still, Congress is\nhardly united, even on trade. Some members have objected to the adverse impacts punitive\ntariffs are having on their constituencies, or they have opposed imposing tariffs on allies\nat the same time tariffs are imposed on China. And some members criticized President\nTrump’s decision in May 2018 to ease harsh sanctions against the prominent Chinese\nhigh-technology firm ZTE, in response to a personal plea from the Chinese president.\nNevertheless, President Trump’s dominance in the Republican Party means that few in the\nRepublican ranks controlling Congress are inclined to oppose him, especially on China.\nIndeed, Congress is generally endorsing the most significant reevaluation of American-\nChina policy since the start of normalization fifty years ago. As such, it can be said that\nChinese influence on Capitol Hill has reached a low point.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nCongress is in the midst of a major reevaluation of the very assumptions underlying\nthe decades-old American policy of “engagement” with China. Because of this increasingly\ncompetitive, even adversarial, new climate, Chinese influence and information operations\nare widely coming to be seen as expressions of a political system whose values are\nantithetical to those of the United States and as a threat to the integrity of Congress and\nour democracy. Arguing, as many have done as far back as Majority Leader Mike Mansfield,\nthat Congress should move forward with positive engagement with China while seeking to\nCongress\n17\npragmatically manage our differences now seems, in the current environment, both naïve\nand quixotic.\nPromote Transparency\nFollow-on congressional oversight will go far toward educating the Congress, the media,\nand the public about these important topics. The issues are complicated and have no simple\nsolutions. Various specialists within and outside the US government should be consulted\nin determining the full scope of the problem and what should be done.\nPromote Integrity\nCongress needs also to distinguish between issues that present a real threat to the United\nStates, such as Chinese espionage and Chinese-directed monitoring of Chinese students\non US campuses, and institutions such as Confucius Institutes, which, as we have noted\nelsewhere in this report, can be better regulated by universities themselves.\nPromote Reciprocity\nIn coming up with remedial steps, Congress must consider the broader bilateral relationship.\nIt is asked to weigh carefully the continued important positive elements in the US-China\nrelationship, the negative consequences that might arise from a confrontational approach\nto China, and America’s need to protect and foster its strengths and interests.\nNOTES\n1 ​Sources for the information and judgments in this section include: United States Congress.

The American partner city was home\nto a large number of national security professionals and university and government\nscientists, including many of PRC origin. The partnership was proposed and\nshepherded by the manager of a for-profit Chinese “exchanges” company—a woman\nof PRC origin. She was assisted by an American citizen of PRC origin who was running\nfor a position on the local school board.\nIn a briefing, an American China expert told the local sister city committee that there\nwas no reason not to explore a partnership, provided the American side had defined\ngoals and was aware of Beijing’s increasingly repressive domestic policies, its growing\nsuspicions of US influence, and its well-funded efforts to increase its influence overseas.\nThe man running for the local school board objected to this characterization and\npointed out that China’s constitution gives the CCP paramount authority in China.\nAfter a long debate, the new sister city agreement was signed in the fall of 2018.\nSome Americans involved objected to China’s insistence that all sister city activities\nbe carried out “in accordance with the principles on the establishment of diplomatic\nrelations between the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China\n( 根据中美两国建交原则 ),” because this seemed to be a reference to the One China\nPrinciple, which might be invoked to preclude exchanges with Taiwan. Despite these\nobjections, the phrase appeared in the signed agreement because the Chinese side said\nthat the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries required\nthat all sister city agreements include such language and the US side did not want to\nderail the agreement by insisting otherwise.\nThe story of this sister city agreement illustrates the challenges and opportunities\n“sub-national entities” (local governments, cities, and states) face in the United States\nwhen dealing with a China intent on maximizing its influence in America and across\nthe globe. As this report details in other sections, the age of innocent engagement\nis over, and this is now true for American local officials as well as for representatives\n20\nof the US federal government. Because most PRC attempts to influence American\nopinion and practices occur at the local level, and because local media, universities,\ncompanies, and advocacy agencies are often involved in these efforts, knowingly and\nunknowingly, local leaders, just as much as national leaders, need an understanding\nof PRC goals and strategies.\n“We Have Friends All Over the World”\nChina pursues sister city relationships under an organization called the Chinese\nPeople’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, which is part of China’s\nunited front bureaucratic structure (See Appendix: Chinese Influence Operations\nBureaucracy) that aims to strengthen the rule of the Chinese Communist Party and\nincrease China’s influence overseas. With its long-standing Maoist slogan, “We Have\nFriends All Over the World,” the association had its heyday in the 1950s, when China\nwas isolated and the group became a bridge between China and overseas supporters.\nIt was marginalized in the 1980s, as China opened to the West and established\ndiplomatic relations with hundreds of countries. However, under the administration of\nCommunist Party leader Xi Jinping, the association has been revitalized as China seeks\nto groom local business, political, and media leaders in countries around the world. Its\nnew standing is exemplified by the splendor of its headquarters located in the elegant\nold Italian Embassy compound near Tiananmen Square.\nThe way the association and other Chinese organizations cultivate relationships\nwith local officials follows a general pattern. First, in the United States, China\ndemands that sister city relationships and state-to-province sister relations be carried\nout under “principles” on which Sino-US relations were established in the 1970s\n(as interpreted by the Chinese side). This means that China’s representatives will\nlikely protest should local officials seek to maintain ties with representatives of Taiwan\nor with other individuals, such as the Dalai Lama, whom China regards as hostile\nforces. Second, it is important to understand why China seeks a relationship with\nlocalities, especially during times of tension with the federal government: China\nseeks to build alternative networks of interaction and support, while using these new\nrelationships to help gain new traction back in Washington. Local American expertise,\ninformation, and opinion are also of more than passing political interest to Beijing,\neven if on paper an exchange relationship is only to “enhance people’s friendship,\nfurther international cooperation, safeguard world peace and promote common\ndevelopment,” 1 for Beijing understands clearly that local leaders today become the\nState and Local Governments\n21\nnational leaders of tomorrow. For China, all exchanges have a political character and\nhopefully a political harvest.\nThird, it is important for local officials to understand that local American “exchange”\ncompanies that bring Chinese delegations to the United States and promote\nprofessional interactions between the United States and China all depend on official\nPRC sanction and have received approval to receive Chinese delegations. The business\nmodel of such companies is, of necessity, as much political as financial. Even if they\nconduct high-quality programs, they should not be viewed as disinterested actors.\nThey, too, are subject to rules made by the Chinese Communist Party, its united front\nbureaucracy, and united front strategic imperatives.\nFinally, American citizens of PRC origin have played a key role in promoting mutually\nbeneficial engagement over the past forty years. As US-China relations grow more\ncontentious, however, and as Beijing calls more aggressively for diaspora Chinese to\nserve the “motherland,” it will be necessary for citizen diplomats (including those who\nare not of PRC origin) to better educate themselves about American national interests\nin the US-China competition and the areas in which the nation’s values, institutional\npractices, and strategic goals are incompatible. Such awareness is even more vital for\nChinese Americans who seek political office and whose abilities to navigate these\nshoals will depend on their knowledge of this complex system of interaction.\nAmerican Communities as Engines of Engagement\nThe American federal system allows sub-national governments considerable leeway\nto pursue local interests generally regardless of Washington’s security concerns. Free\nfrom geostrategic worries, state, county, and municipal leaders who have formed\ncommercial and people-to-people relationships with the PRC have been a bulwark\nof better US‐China relations since the early 1970s, and their efforts to build mutual\nunderstanding and solve joint problems formed the bedrock of bilateral relations over\nfour decades. However, as China becomes more reliant on its old Leninist system and\n“united front” tactics ( 统战战略 ), Sino-US relations become more contentious, and\nthe CCP seeks to more forcefully build influence in American communities through\nchannels detailed in this study, local leaders will be called upon to give greater\nweight to national interests when forming exchange relationships with PRC actors.\nConversely, as Beijing’s relations with Washington worsen, China will likely seek to\nuse tried-and-true “divide and conquer” tactics by cultivating new relations with more\nstate and local-level officials.\nSection 2\n22\nBeginning in the early 1970s, China and the United States built trust and common\nprosperity through cooperation at the local level. The work of two hundred sister city\npairs and over forty sister state/province partnerships was reinforced by state and city\ntrade and investment promotion offices, chambers of commerce, Chinese American\nand traditional clan associations, Chinatown cultural centers, and various and sundry\nactivities at US colleges and universities, secondary schools, church groups, and\nmuseums. Following the establishment of the pioneering Washington State China\nRelations Council in 1979, 2 centers for joint innovation and entrepreneurship, such as\nthe Michigan China Innovation Center 3 and the Maryland China Business Council 4\nwere set up in nearly every state. Twenty-seven states now maintain trade offices in\nChina—more than in any other nation. 5 Americans of Mainland, Taiwanese, and\nHong Kong ancestry have founded cultural centers like the Asia Institute–Crane House\nin Louisville, Kentucky, 6 and the China Institute in New York. 7 After forty years of\nengagement, the US-China focused foundations, educational and exchange programs,\nresearch institutes, and arts and entertainment initiatives throughout the country\nare too many and various to be cataloged. American mayors, county executives, and\ngovernors—many of whom travel to China often and host an unending stream of\nChinese visitors—have leveraged the work of these groups to enrich local coffers and\nlocal culture.\nAmerican Communities as Targets\nWhile American local governments value such “exchanges” for financial and cultural\nreasons, “exchange” ( 交流 ) has always been viewed as a practical political tool by\nBeijing, 8 and all of China’s “exchange” organizations have been assigned political\nmissions. The US-China People’s Friendship Association, for example, has over thirty\nsections across the United States that promote “positive ties.” While its activities\nare not usually overtly political, the USCPFA Statement of Principles includes the\nfollowing: “We recognize that friendship between our two peoples must be based on the\nknowledge of and respect for the sovereignty of each country; therefore, we respect\nthe declaration by the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China that\nthe resolution of the status of Taiwan is the internal affair of the Chinese on both sides\nof the Taiwan Straits.” 9 Some 190 Chinese Students and Scholars Associations 10 (CSSA)\nat American colleges and universities (see the section on “Universities”) also promote\nlocal exchanges and, in some cases, political activities, 11 as do the 110 Confucius\nInstitutes in America. The China General Chamber of Commerce–USA was founded\nin 2005 to build stronger investment environments for Chinese companies through\nlocal corporate citizenship programs planned by its six regional offices and municipal\nState and Local Governments\n23\naffiliates. 12 These and other organizations maintain close ties to China’s diplomatic\nmissions in the United States and are often in contact with training or “cultural\nexchange” companies that bring delegations of PRC experts and Communist Party\nmembers to US cities and states for so-called study tours.\nUS and Chinese groups promoting exchanges and investment have often been a\nvaluable resource for American local leaders—see, for example, the Virginia Museum of\nFine Arts annual China Fest 13 or the Chinese investment program in Greenville, South\nCarolina 14 —but there have been other instances in which American politicians working\nwith Chinese organizations have been drawn into schemes that cost them their jobs.\nPerhaps the most telling case is that of four officials in Ypsilanti, Michigan, who, in\n2017, accepted a trip to China that they had been told was paid for by the Wayne State\nCSSA. The trip was eventually revealed as a boondoggle funded by a developer, Amy\nXue Foster, who hoped to build a $300 million “Chinatown” in the area. 15 The four\nofficials, including the mayor, were fired.\nThis is not to suggest that shady Chinese nationals are always plotting to corrupt\notherwise innocent American leaders; US politicians have a long history of willingly\naccepting free trips, gifts, and other favors from the PRC or its fronts. As other\nsections of this study make clear, however, Beijing-directed activities such as the secret\npurchase of American Chinese-language newspapers and radio stations, harassment of\nlocal Chinese American dissidents, and the operation of CCP cells in local American\nbusinesses and universities do require heightened vigilance by US sub-national\nauthorities, regardless of how much investment, how many tuition-paying students,\nor how many tourists China is able to produce.\nChina Exchanges and Chinese Leverage\nThe over forty years of engagement with China has created for American cities\nand states, as it has for American corporations and universities, deep interests and\ntraditions with regard to China. However, the local policies that have guided these\nrelationships are sometimes at odds with Washington’s policies, even our larger\nnational interest. Although the United States has pulled out of the Paris Agreement, the\nseventeen governors who have joined the United States Climate Alliance, for example,\ncontinue to work with Beijing, which many would agree is a very salutary thing. But\nsometimes sub-national solidarity with China can become overexuberant, as it did\non a July 2018 trip to Hong Kong by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who declared\nSection 2\n24\nhis city’s independence from the looming Sino-US trade war. Garcetti stated that Los\nAngeles and China “have closely integrated economies, closely integrated cultures and\nclosely integrated geography. . . . ​We hope to be the leading Chinese city in America\nfor investment, tourism and students.” 17\nSometimes federalism, in the form of local leaders’ independent China policies,\nis a good thing and may, during times of upheaval in Washington, DC, help to\noffset unwise national policies. But if US-China relations continue on their current\ndownward trajectory, there will be an increased danger that independent state and\nmunicipal China policies will sometimes conflict with national interest and hinder the\nUnited States in its competition with China to shape global norms\nand practices. As China’s wealth and ambition grow and as Beijing is becoming more\nadept at turning local American “China interests” into Chinese leverage, sub-national\nAmerican governmental entities that formed their China policies in the Era of\nEngagement must become mindful that a new era will require them to develop new\nstrategies for a new Era of Competition.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nThe following practices can foster the kind of constructive vigilance that local\ngovernments will need to exercise in their continued cooperation with China.\nPromote Transparency\nSub-national governments should:\n• Not have secret agreements with Chinese entities, including foundations,\ncorporations, or individuals. All MOUs and contracts should be transparent\nand public. All cooperative proposals should be subject to public hearings.\nAll potential projects should receive the same due diligence that partnerships\nwith American entities would demand. No exceptions to American laws or best\npractices should be made to placate allegedly “Chinese” customs. And in no way\nshould China be allowed to have a veto over potential exchanges with other\ncountries, entities, or individuals such as Taiwan or the Dalai Lama.\n• Share experiences and concerns with peers through the National Conference of\nMayors, the National Governors Association, the National Council of County\nAssociation Executives, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. Best\nState and Local Governments\n25\npractices for cooperating with China in ways that do not undermine national\ninterests should be a regular topic at annual meetings.\n• Meet with stakeholders across sectors—local leaders of industry, academia,\nthe arts, religious groups, Chinese American organizations, and professional\nassociations—to discuss issues emerging from cooperation with China, because a\ncommunity-wide approach is required.\n• Celebrate successes and share best practices. In the era of US-China competition,\nthere is more reason than ever to publicize cooperative projects that enrich local\ncommunities, build understanding, and solve common problems, while always\nbeing mindful of the larger framework of China’s goal and American interests.\nPromote Integrity\nSub-national governments should:\n• Educate themselves and other stakeholders on the goals and methods of\nChinese influence operations. While Americans are quick to label any\nwariness of communist parties as McCarthyism, and while the potential for\nracial stereotyping is real, the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front Work\nDepartment and International Liaison Department—two of the main bodies\noverseeing such exchanges—are in fact active and well resourced and determined.\nNo mainland Chinese organization in the United States—corporate, academic, or\npeople-to-people—is free of Beijing’s control, even if it is not formally part of the\nUnited Front.\n• Keep abreast of Washington’s China policies and improve political risk\nanalysis capabilities. American China policy is evolving rapidly and cannot be\nincorporated into local practice without expert counsel and advice. China’s\nresponses to US actions are also fast-moving, as are Chinese domestic events\nthat have an impact on local American interests. The 2018 sell-off of Chineseowned\nproperties in the United States was instructive in this regard. 18 State and\nmunicipal governments should therefore improve their political risk analysis\ncapabilities and continually reassess their cooperative relationships with China.\nIn effect, to successfully play in the China arena, sub-nationals need to develop\ntheir own sources of expertise.\nSection 2\n26\n• Communicate regularly with federal agencies like the FBI whenever doubts arise\nabout a cooperative proposal or the Chinese institutions promoting it. Pay attention\nto who is on Chinese delegations. Get name lists beforehand and do due diligence\non them.\nPromote Reciprocity\nSub-national governments should:\n• Follow the money, and the power. In any cooperative venture, US local\ngovernments should determine exactly where Chinese investments originate and\nknow which Beijing ministry has final decision-making authority related to the\nproject. They should also check lists of funders and organizations against lists of\nknown United Front agencies and registered foreign agents.\n• Not treat other stakeholders—other countries, Taiwan, or companies—in a\nprejudiced manner to win favor in Beijing.\nNOTES\n1 ​As promised in the referenced sister cities agreement.\n2 ​Washington State China Relations Council. https://www​.wscrc​.org.\n3 ​Michigan-China Innovation Center. https:// www​. michiganchina​. org.\n4 ​Maryland-China Business Council. http://www​.mcbc​.net.\n5 ​Burnett, Jennifer. “State Overseas Trade Offices, 2015.” Council of State Governments.

Although they form a vital strand in the social fabric of the United\nStates, Beijing also views Chinese Americans as members of a worldwide Chinese diaspora\nthat, whatever the actual citizenship of individuals may be, presumes them to retain\nnot only an interest in the welfare of China but also a loosely defined cultural, and even\npolitical, allegiance to the so-called Motherland ( 祖国 ). Under Xi Jinping’s leadership,\ndiaspora Chinese have been called on to help achieve the Rejuvenation of the Chinese\nNation—a summons that places growing pressure on ethnic Chinese around the world to\nserve the “China Dream” ( 中国梦 ). While many overseas Chinese do feel pride in China as a\ncountry and the Chinese as a race, Beijing’s claims on their loyalty can have the untoward\neffect of calling into question their devotion to their own home nations.\nUnder both the Nationalist and Communist parties, overseas Chinese have played an\nimportant role in modern Chinese politics as well as in China’s relations with the outside\nworld. Diaspora communities worldwide have been key sources of legitimacy and support\nfor whatever government held power in Beijing, but just as often they have been centers of\nantigovernment agitation. With PRC influence-seeking activities now expanding, China’s\nlong-standing focus on diaspora communities has also intensified to become an important\nelement in overall US-China relations. Such trends demand not only greater societal\nattention and understanding but also an appropriate response from the US government\nas well as non-governmental institutions.\nAs the Chinese Communist Party seeks to encourage, even entice, ethnic-Chinese\ncommunities and individuals overseas to more fully support its interests, the Chinese\nAmericans in the United States and other free societies need to better inform themselves\nas to the nature of this dynamic, and our governmental institutions may need to do more\nto defend their freedoms against harmfully intrusive and coercive activities. At the same\ntime, it is essential that we not allow overseas Chinese as an ethnic group to fall under\nany kind indiscriminate cloud of suspicion. Above all, it is important to bear in mind\nthat while ethnic Chinese can be quite naturally expected to take an interest in things\nChinese, it is the Chinese Communist Party that puts a target on their backs through its\npresumption that they are all somehow the “sons and daughters of the Yellow Emperor”\n( 炎黄子孙 ) and thus owe some measure of loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party.\n30\nOrigins and Structure\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, when the United States maintained an alliance with the\nregime of Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan, pro-PRC organizations faced challenges gaining\ntraction in the United States. During the 1950s, the FBI, aided by pro-Kuomintang security\norganizations, closely monitored their activities and participants. This antagonistic state\nof affairs began to change after President Nixon’s historic trip to China in 1972. 1 On\nFebruary 24, 1973, more than forty Chinese on the East Coast, most of them immigrants\nfrom Taiwan, established the Washington Association to Promote China Unification to\nhelp advocate for Beijing’s official positions. One of the founders was a professor at the\nUniversity of Maryland who was actively involved in organizations that already supported\nChina’s position on Taiwan and Tibet. 2 However, a more beneficial contribution came\nin the form of advancing US-China scientific, educational, and cultural exchanges that\nstarted to be promoted by a growing number of preeminent Chinese American scientists,\nengineers, and academics who were also advising the Chinese government to launch\nreforms in science and education. These Chinese Americans were also personally helping\nthem establish various programs to bring thousands of talented Chinese students to\nAmerican institutions of learning.\nRecognizing the achievements, influence, and growth of the Chinese diaspora, Beijing\nundertook a systematic program designed to target and exploit overseas Chinese\ncommunities as a means of furthering its own political, economic, and security interests.\nThe Beijing government used specialized bureaucracies to manage what it called “united\nfront” activities abroad. Organizations such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office inside\nthe Communist Party Central Committee’s United Front Work Department 3 and the State\nCouncil’s Taiwan Affairs Office led the charge. Almost all of these agencies have established\nnongovernmental fronts overseas, including the China Council for the Promotion of\nPeaceful National Reunification, the China Overseas Exchange Association, and the China\nOverseas Friendship Association. 4 Other “united front” organizations, such as the Chinese\nEnterprise Association and other Chinese chambers of commerce, are almost always linked\nboth to the United Front Work Department and to the Ministry of Commerce.\nFollowing the violent crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in Beijing on June 4,\n1989, the Chinese Communist Party redoubled its efforts to reach out to overseas Chinese.\nMany members of these communities had supported the student democracy movement,\nproviding funds and safe havens for fleeing dissidents. But senior Chinese leader Deng\nXiaoping was not dissuaded. In 1989 and again in 1993, he spoke of the “unique\nopportunity” overseas Chinese offered the PRC. Deng insisted that by drawing on their\nhelp, China could break out of international isolation and improve its international\npolitical standing. Gaining influence over overseas Chinese groups in order to “turn them\ninto propaganda bases for China” became an important task of overseas Chinese united\nfront work. 5\nThe Chinese American Community\n31\nIn China, all of the organizations involved in outreach to the overseas Chinese community\nare led by senior members of the Chinese Communist Party. Sun Chunlan, the former\nhead of the United Front Work Department, is listed as the president of the China Overseas\nFriendship Association and the executive vice president of the China Council to Promote\nPeaceful Reunification. The head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, Qiu Yuanping,\nalso leads the China Overseas Exchange Association. Madame Qiu has a career background\nwith the Party’s International Liaison Department. The president of the China Council for\nthe Promotion of Peaceful Reunification is none other than Yu Zhengsheng, the former\nchairman of the Chinese People’s Consultative Conference and a former member of the\nStanding Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party’s Central Committee. 6\nGoals and Methods\nThe key goal of the Party’s united front work with overseas Chinese is to gain support for\nthe Communist Party’s efforts to modernize the country by convincing members of overseas\nChinese communities that the Party is the sole representative of China and to isolate\ncompeting forces that the Party perceives to be adversarial, or even hostile. For example,\nas part of a massive campaign to monitor, control, and even intimidate China’s ethnic\nminorities (no matter where in the world they are), Chinese authorities are creating a global\nregistry of Uighurs who live outside of China. Chinese authorities threatening to detain\nUighur relatives who remain in China if they do not provide personal information of their\nrelatives living abroad to the Chinese police. This campaign has particularly targeted Uighurs\nliving in Germany but is now reaching Uighurs in the United States as well. 7 Uighurs are not\nalone; Tibetan exiles living in the United States have long reported similar campaigns against\nmembers of their families and community. Chinese security officials have even been known\nto travel to America on tourist visas to exert pressure on Chinese dissidents living here. 8 FBI\nagents have contacted prominent Chinese exiles in the United States offering them protection\nfrom Chinese agents who might travel to the United States to menace them. 9\nFor most Chinese Americans, however, China’s efforts to influence them are far more\nanodyne. The official description of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO) states\nits purpose as: “to enhance unity and friendship in overseas Chinese communities; to\nmaintain contact with and support overseas Chinese media and Chinese language schools;\n[and] to increase cooperation and exchanges between overseas Chinese and China related\nto the economy, science, culture and education.” Over the past three decades, the OCAO\nhas dispatched former reporters and editors from the OCAO-run China News Service to\nestablish pro-Beijing Chinese media organizations in the West. (Chinese officials have\ndescribed such Chinese-language media outlets, schools, and other kinds of organizations as\nthe “three treasures” ( 三宝 ) of united front work overseas.) 10\nOfficials from Beijing have stated clearly that they do not view overseas Chinese as simple\ncitizens of foreign countries, but rather as “overseas compatriots” ( 华侨同胞们 ) who have both\nSection 3\n32\nhistorical connections and responsibilities as “sons and daughters of the Yellow Emperor”\nto support the PRC’s goals and the “China Dream.” As Xi Jinping 11 described it in a 2014\nspeech to the Seventh Conference of Overseas Chinese Associations, “The Rejuvenation of\nthe Chinese Nation is a Dream shared by all Chinese” [emphasis added]. In January 2018,\nPolitburo member and former state counselor and foreign minister Yang Jiechi made this\npresumption even clearer when he called upon the government to expand and strengthen\n“Overseas Chinese Patriotic Friendly Forces” in the service of the “Great Rejuvenation” of\nthe Chinese nation.\nIn addition to appealing to the cultural affinities of Chinese Americans, the Chinese\ngovernment has also implemented a wide range of programs to strengthen ties with\nelite members of this community. China has appointed hundreds of Chinese Americans\nto positions in its united front organizations and provided thousands with free trips to\nChina, during which they have been feted by senior united front officials. In some cases,\nChinese Americans are offered senior positions in united front organizations. For example,\nin 2013, one Chinese American, a native of Guangdong Province, became the first and\nonly foreigner to become a vice president of the Chinese Overseas Friendship Association\n(COFA). 12\nChina has used this tactic of handing out what one senior Chinese American called\n“honors” to Chinese Americans as a way for united front departments, and even\nespionage agencies, to cultivate contacts in the United States, often to the detriment of\nother groups—such as Tibetans, Taiwanese independence supporters, supporters of the\nRepublic of China, Uighurs, prodemocracy activists, and other independent Chinese\nvoices with which the Party does not agree. Chinese Americans appointed to such\npositions in organizations established by the Communist Party have subsequently led\nprotests against Taiwan and Tibet and participated in campaigns to silence Chinese\ndissidents, such as the exiled billionaire Guo Wengui. For example, a Chinese American\nwho is a vice president of COFA spearheaded a campaign against Guo that was encouraged\nby officials from the PRC. On a video posted to YouTube, this individual is seen railing\nagainst Guo, vowing that he will “not rest” until Guo is returned to China to answer\ncharges against him. 13\nUnited Front organizations in China have been surprisingly aggressive and transparent\nin their public tasking of Chinese Americans to carry out activities that support the PRC\npolicies. One example occurred after the 19th Party congress in October 2017. The stateowned\nFujian Daily reported on November 24, 2017, that representatives of local Chinese\ncommunity associations based in the United States, Australia, the Philippines, and Europe\nhad gathered in Fujian and received letters of appointment from local provincial and city\nUnited Front agencies in China to serve officially as “overseas propaganda agents” on their\nreturn to their home countries. These commissions obliged them to accept responsibility for\npromoting the decisions of the Party’s recent national congress in their home countries. The\nThe Chinese American Community\n33\narticle noted that this practice of offering Party commissions to overseas Chinese to work\noverseas on united front tasks was not new. The president of the United Fujianese American\nAssociation ( 美国福建公所 ) told reporters: “I have received quite a few letters of appointment\non previous occasions, but none for which I have felt such deep significance as the one\ntoday. It’s a heavy responsibility.” 14\nPeaceful Reunification Councils\nA key goal of PRC overseas activities is to convince, and sometimes pressure, Chinese in\nthe United States to accept that the PRC government in Beijing is the sole representative\nof China and Chinese, and that the Republic of China on Taiwan is an illegitimate\ngovernment. To this end, in 1988, the Party’s United Front Work Department founded the\nChina Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification, and the Washington,\nDC, Association to Promote China Unification was folded into the council. The DC\nchapter’s assignment was to organize concerts, demonstrations, and other gatherings\nto support the PRC. 15 Other chapters soon opened, so that by 2018, the council had\nestablished thirty-three in the United States and more than two hundred branches overseas.\nIn America, these organizations are generally registered as domestic nonprofit community\norganizations, even though their leadership in Beijing includes senior members of the\nChinese Communist Party. Indeed, an article in the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of\nthe Chinese Communist Party, spoke in glowing terms about how useful the Peaceful\nReunification Councils were in furthering China’s goals of taking over Taiwan, noting\nthat while chapters of the Peaceful Reunification Council complied with US law by\nregistering as nonprofits, they were established to support Chinese government policies\nand coordinate activities with PRC consulates in the United States. 16 “Over the years, the\nChina Peaceful Reunification Council in Northern California has actively cooperated\nwith the local Chinese consulate to work against ‘Taiwan independence’ and promote\nnational reunification activities, and has some influence in San Francisco’s overseas Chinese\ncommunity,” the Northern California Council candidly notes on its website. 17\nAround the United States, the councils count numerous prominent Chinese Americans as\nmembers. For example, one successful California businesswoman was for years the honorary\nchairwoman of the council in Northern California. 18 While helping promote US-China\neducational exchanges, this individual has also consistently advocated on behalf of PRC\npolicies in the United States, including China’s claims on Taiwan, and has helped to organize\ndemonstrations against “Taiwan independence.” She is listed as an advisor to the China\nOverseas Exchange Association, which is part of the United Front Work Department. 19\nThe Chinese government has also sought to co-opt local Chinese American community\nassociations to serve its goals. 20 In the past, organizations such as regional associations,\nknown as Tongs ( 同乡会 ), had generally been close to the Nationalist government of Taiwan.\nIn San Francisco, however, that began to change as early as the 1980s when Soon Suey\nSection 3\n34\nSing, one of San Francisco’s six major community organizations representing Chinese\nimmigrants, became the first major Chinese group to fly the flag of the PRC on its building.\nThen a second Tong declared its fealty to Beijing, and a competition broke out between the\nPRC and Taiwan in San Francisco’s Chinatown to see which side could fly the most flags.\nThis competition can be vividly seen from the seventeenth floor of a public housing project\noverlooking Chinatown, where PRC and Republic of China flags sit atop adjacent buildings\nstretching into the horizon. The value of these associations to Beijing can be seen in this\nexample: When China’s president Xi Jinping visited the United States in September 2015,\none of the leaders of San Francisco’s local Chinese American community associations\nwas listed as first among twenty prominent Chinese Americans honored by the Chinese\npresident. 21\nChinese Americans and the Chinese People’s Consultative Conference\nSeveral Chinese Americans are so trusted by Beijing that they are direct participants in\nChina’s most prominent national united front body, the Chinese People’s Consultative\nConference (CPPCC). The preamble of China’s constitution defines the Chinese People’s\nPolitical Consultative Conference as “a broadly based representative organization of the\nunited front which . . . ​will play a still more important role in the country’s political and\nsocial life, in promoting friendship with other countries and in the struggle for socialist\nmodernization and for the reunification and unity of the country.” In practice, the CPPCC\nhas served as an important advisory committee to help legitimize Chinese Communist\nParty’s rule both domestically and abroad.\nBeijing has been appointing Chinese Americans to the CPPCC for years. In some cases,\nauthorities in Beijing seem to have had problems finding appropriately influential\nAmericans to take seats on the committee, such as in 2017, when a Chinese property\ndeveloper and educator (who appears to still be a Chinese citizen) was one of seven\n“Americans” listed as CPPCC members. 22\nIn doling out prestigious positions on the CPPCC, China seeks to show overseas\nChinese that prominent members of their community want to be connected with\nChina’s government. The American contingent to the thirteenth CPPCC (announced in\nMarch 2018) was no exception. Perhaps the most remarkable in years, the list of thirtyfive\noverseas representatives included four highly successful Chinese American academics,\nscientists, and businessmen. 23\nThe appointment of Chinese Americans to positions on this advisory body to the Chinese\nCommunist Party raises difficult questions of divided national loyalty. Americans should,\nof course, be free to participate in whatever organizations they see fit, since freedom of\nassociation is hardwired into the constitutional DNA of the United States. However, the\nCPPCC is not an independent civil society NGO, but an organization controlled, managed,\nThe Chinese American Community\n35\nand dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. Members are expected to adhere to the\ndisciplines and goals of the Party and work to strengthen China and the Party’s rule of\nChina. Members of the CPPCC are expected to write reports about how their activities have\naligned with China’s interests and to detail their work on China’s behalf. 24 The potential\nexploitation of Chinese American members in this body by the Chinese government not\nonly risks harming the interests of the United States but also has the potential to harm the\nsecurity, reputation, and welfare of these Chinese Americans.\nA similar quandary could present itself to those Chinese Americans who have chosen\nto accept positions as consultants for another united front organization, the All-China\nFederation of Returned Overseas Chinese, which also serves the Party’s interests. In 2018,\ntwelve representatives from the United States, including wealthy businessmen and civic\nleaders, were listed as advisors of the Federation’s 10 th congress. The Chinese government\npicked them in recognition of their prominence and efforts in advocating positions friendly\nto Beijing. 25\nTo engender a sense of close support, state-owned Chinese media outlets routinely report\nabout such contacts made between prominent Chinese Americans and senior Chinese\nofficials. There are literally hundreds of such reports in the Chinese-language press\nabout prominent Chinese Americans escorting leading figures from China’s united front\nbureaucracy in the United States or being hosted by them in China. 26 In May 2017, Li\nKexin, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Washington, praised the\nPeaceful Reunification Council’s DC chapter for holding a “peaceful reunification forum”\nin Washington and for opposing Taiwan’s independence. 27 Officials from China have also\ntraveled freely to the United States to take part in conferences and activities designed\nto further China’s influence operations in the United States. For example, United Front\nofficials traveled to the United States in November 2016 for the council’s annual executive\nmeeting, during which the council pledged to renew its efforts to “oppose Taiwan’s\nindependence.” 28\nConclusion and Recommendations\nAs US citizens, Chinese Americans enjoy the same constitutional rights of freedom of speech,\nassociation, and political participation as everyone else, and their exercise of these rights is\nfully legitimate and protected by the Constitution and law. What’s more, it is incumbent\non the United States government and American society as a whole not to demonize\nChinese Americans for their feelings for and pride in China. However, it is also important\nthat all American citizens be aware that such feelings can sometimes be exploited by an\nauthoritarian regime to advance its goals and interests. Here it is not Chinese Americans who\nare at fault for having an attachment to their “motherland,” but it is the Chinese Communist\nParty for cynically attempting to use Chinese Americans to further its own interests in the\nprocess making overseas Chinese communities vulnerable to distrust.\nSection 3\n36\nWhile the US government needs to adopt a no-tolerance policy toward attempts by Chinese\nsecurity forces to travel to the United States to secretly harass, manipulate, intimidate, and\nmonitor China’s perceived enemies in the United States, the best antidote to such intrusion\nis for federal and local governments to do more to strengthen ties to Chinese American\ncommunities and to give greater visibility into the various inducements and pressures\nBeijing exerts on these communities. That the FBI has begun to reach out to prominent\nChinese in the United States, offering protection, is a good beginning.\nA sustained education campaign is also urgently needed to inform the members of the\nChinese American community of the potential adverse consequences of involvement with\nChina’s united front activities. Chinese American organizations also need to do a better job\nof informing themselves about the underlying goals of PRC’s united front organizations\nas there are potential reputational costs of allying with them and losing independence. It\ncan be taken as a positive sign that, for example, the Committee of 100, an organization\nfounded by many illustrious Chinese Americans, has begun to debate the possibility of\nbarring its leading members from accepting positions with PRC united front organizations\nofficially aligned with the Chinese Communist Party. 29\nChina’s activities in the United States can also be made more transparent by requiring\nspin-off groups from united front organizations in Beijing to register under the Foreign\nAgent Registration Act as agents of a foreign power. This would include all of the bureaus\nof the Peaceful Reunification Council, the China Overseas Exchange Association, and the\nChina Overseas Friendship Association, among others that are, in fact, influence-seeking\norganizations with political implications run by a foreign state. In addition, Chinese\nAmericans who accept positions in united front structures—such as the Chinese People’s\nPolitical Consultative Conference—should also be required to register as agents of a foreign\npower seeking influence in the United States. China has tried to sell these “honors” to\nthe Chinese American community as a costfree way of expressing their sincere feelings\nof pride in China. However, the reality is that once a person accepts such “honors,” along\nwith free travel to China and other emoluments, the Chinese Communist Party will always\nseek to exact a further price. And where that price creates divided loyalties and results in\nactions harmful to American interests and values, the US government must respond with\nappropriate legal and regulatory measures.\nNotes\n1 ​For a broad take on the issue of Chinese influence operations, see Mattis, Peter, “An American Lens on China’s\nInterference and Influence-Building Abroad.” The Asan Forum.

Ever since the Carter administration first explored the possibility\nwith Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese counterparts of sending Chinese students to\nthe United States in 1977–78, 1 PRC government authorities (like their Republican-era\npredecessors) have seen American universities as integral to China’s economic and\nscientific development. For the first two decades after normalization, the Chinese\ngovernment placed a priority on sending students in STEM subjects (Science,\nTechnology, Engineering, Mathematics). Over time, however, fields of study broadened\ninto the humanities, social sciences, and the arts, a change that has mirrored the shift\nin educational exchange from primarily a state-directed to a private consumer-driven\nphenomenon that saw an increasing number of middle-class Chinese parents opting\nto send their children to the United States for liberal arts undergraduate university,\nand even secondary school education. The net result has been that several million\nChinese students have now successfully matriculated through the US higher education\nsystem. During the 2017–2018 academic year, for instance, a record 350,755 Chinese\nstudents were enrolled in American universities (with an additional 80,000 in high\nschools), 2 out of a total of 1.5 million Chinese students studying worldwide in the\nsame year. 3 (Altogether, since the late 1970s, an estimated 5.2 million Chinese have\nattended foreign universities.) 4 Unlike the early years of this epic exchange, a majority\nof Chinese students have become able to pay full tuition, creating an extremely\nsignificant source of revenue for financially stressed American universities and colleges.\n(Chinese pay tuition worth an estimated $12 billion per year, according to the US\nDepartment of Commerce.) 5\nUS universities and American society have benefited significantly from this exchange,\nand from the presence of international students generally. Chinese students have\nhelped to diversify the makeup of US student bodies, they often contribute positively\nin the classroom, and they have made a real contribution in joint research projects\nwith university faculty. Many have remained in the United States postgraduation to\npursue professional careers, build their lives, and become American citizens—a sizable\ncontribution to American society, to the US economy, and to technological innovation\nand the knowledge base in numerous fields. The engineering, medical, and hard\nsciences have benefited particularly, but so have the humanities and social sciences.\nIndeed, those who negotiated the initial educational and scientific exchange accords\nback in 1978–1979 could never have envisioned how much of a success story US-China\nhigher educational exchanges would become over the next four decades.\n40\nFor their part, American universities and US scholars have also engaged in China during\nthis period, although in far fewer—but not insignificant—numbers. (For example, in\n2015–2016, 11,688 American students and scholars were studying in China.) 6 For those\nin the field of Chinese studies, it is de rigueur to study and do research in Chinese\nuniversities. Professional collaboration among faculty—mainly in the sciences and\nmedicine—has also flourished. Some US universities—notably Johns Hopkins School\nof Advanced International Studies (Hopkins-Nanjing Center), New York University\n(NYU-Shanghai), and Duke University (Duke-Kunshan)—have gone so far as to\nestablish campuses in China, while others have opened centers (e.g., Stanford, Virginia,\nChicago, Yale, Harvard, Columbia). Many more American universities have forged\ncollaborative exchange programs with Chinese counterparts.\nWhile US-China exchanges in higher education have primarily been a success\nstory, as in many other dimensions of the Sino-American relationship, clouds have\nappeared on the horizon. 7 American students have become less keen than in the past\nto study in China due to concerns about pollution, lack of open internet access, and\nexpanding political controls. American scholars trying to conduct research in China\nhave run into an increasing number of restrictions and impediments since 2010, due\nto a broad campaign against “foreign hostile forces” and an increasingly draconian\npolitical atmosphere that has cast a shadow across Chinese society, especially over\nhigher education. Whole subject areas and regions of the country are now off-limits\nto American and other foreign scholars for fieldwork; previously normal interactions\nwith Chinese scholars are now often heavily circumscribed; many Chinese scholars\nhave become reluctant to meet with American counterparts; a growing number of\nlibraries are off-limits; central-level archives have been closed, and provincial; municipal\narchives are increasingly restricted; interviews with government officials (at all levels)\nare more difficult to arrange; public opinion surveys must be carried out with Chinese\npartners, if they can be conducted at all; simple eyewitness social research in rural and,\neven some urban areas, is considerably more limited than previously. In short, normal\nscholarly research practices permitted elsewhere in the world are regularly proscribed\nin China. These restrictions also include the inability to hold open and uncensored\npublic scholarly discussions, conferences, and other kinds of events. Meanwhile,\nChinese students and scholars enjoy unimpeded access to all of these activities in the\nUnited States, resulting in a severe asymmetry in Sino-American scholarly exchange.\nThis contravenes the spirit of the bilateral US-China educational exchange accords.\nAt the same time, storm clouds are also gathering on American campuses with respect\nto another aspect of this important relationship, namely, growing concerns about\nunfair Chinese “influence-seeking activities” in the United States.\nUniversities\n41\nConfucius Institutes\nOne of the most controversial aspects of the whole US-China educational exchange\nis the Confucius Institutes (CI), of which there are now 110 (plus 501 Confucius\nClassrooms in secondary schools) across the United States. 8 For secondary schools and\ncolleges that have no or little other coverage of China on campus, CIs are an important\nresource. Sponsored by the Hanban, an organization directly under the Ministry of\nEducation in Beijing, but also with ties to the External Propaganda Leading Group of\nthe CCP Central Committee, the primary mission of CIs is to teach Chinese language\nand culture abroad. However, faculty and other watchdogs have warned that they may\npresent risks to intellectual freedom by using American universities as vehicles through\nwhich to advance Chinese Communist Party propaganda. Accusations leveled at CIs\nrevolve mainly around the exclusive use of PRC materials that promote PRC Chinese\nviewpoints, terminology, and simplified characters; the avoidance of discussion\non controversial topics such as Tibet, Tiananmen, Xinjiang, the Falun Gong, and\nhuman rights in American classrooms and programs; and potential infringement on\ntheoretically independent studies curricula on American campuses.\nAlthough proponents of CIs like to compare them with branches of France’s L’Alliance\nFrancaise, Germany’s Goethe Instituts, and Spain’s Cervantes Institute, they are\ndifferent in important ways. Unlike these other institutions, CIs are joint operations\nlocated inside—and co-funded by—a host university or secondary school for which\nthe Hanban arranges a Chinese university to supply teachers, textbooks, and other\nmaterials. The teachers are paid by the Chinese university (and hence do not hold\ngreen cards or pay US taxes). Typically, the Hanban provides a $150,000 start-up grant\nwith $100,000–$200,000 per year follow-on funding (depending on the institution)\ndirectly to the American university. Secondary schools normally receive $50,000 in\ninitial funding and $15,000 subsequently per annum. Most troublesome are two\nprovisions in the Hanban contracts with US host institutions: One forbids the CIs\nfrom conducting any activities that contravene Chinese law while the other requires\nthat the enabling contract remain confidential, making oversight by the academic\ncommunity difficult.\nSome participating American institutions have belatedly had second thoughts about\ntheir partnerships. In 2014, the University of Chicago terminated its CI contract\nwith the Hanban after months of controversy among faculty, spurred by a highprofile\ncritical article by an emeritus member. 9 Since that time, at least two additional\nAmerican universities have also closed their branches (Pennsylvania State University\nand University of West Florida), 10 and Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), a leading critic of\nalleged Chinese “influence activities,” has written letters to a number of other Florida\ninstitutions hosting CIs requesting that they also be closed. 11 Representatives Michael\nMcCaul (R-TX) and Henry Cuellar (D-TX) called for the same termination in their own\nSection 4\n42\nstate, stating in a letter addressed to their state’s universities that these organizations\n“are a threat to our nation’s security by serving as a platform for China’s intelligence\ncollection and political agenda.” They added that, “We have a responsibility to uphold\nour American values of free expression, and to do whatever is necessary to counter any\nbehavior that poses a threat to our democracy.” The Texas A&M system complied with\nthis request by ordering the closure of all CIs. 12 Then, in August 2018, the University\nof North Florida announced the closure of its CI. 13\nSimilar calls have been made in other states, and the 2019 National Defense\nAuthorization Act restricts Department of Defense language study funding if a\nuniversity hosts a Confucius Institute. 14 Several other universities (including Dickinson\nState University in Pennsylvania, the University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton\nUniversity) that had been contemplated opening CIs, have now decided not to do so.\nAt the same time, Columbia University (and elsewhere) has come under criticism, more\nfor lack of transparency than for its specific violative activities. 15 That said, the majority\nof CIs have so far carried out their mission of language and cultural education without\ncontroversy.\nIn 2014, both the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) and the\nAmerican Association of University Professors (AAUP) called on universities to\nterminate CIs unless their agreements with Hanban were renegotiated to provide for\ntotal transparency and compliance with norms of academic freedom. 16 In 2017, the\nNational Association of Scholars (NAS), a politically conservative nonprofit advocacy\ngroup, 17 undertook an exhaustive study of CIs in the United States and produced a\n183-page report. 18 Echoing the AAUP’s recommendations, the NAS urged closing all\nCIs on the basis of four areas of concern: a restriction of intellectual freedom; lack\nof transparency; “entanglement” (with Chinese party–controlled institutions); and\nworries about them being used for Chinese “soft power” or pro-PRC propaganda.\nIn addition to the above concerns, some have argued that the fact that CI language\nprograms exclusively use PRC textbooks with “simplified” (or mainland-style) Chinese\ncharacters biases the contribution CIs make to Chinese language instruction on\nAmerican campuses. In our view, this is not a serious problem, since students should\nlearn this vocabulary and this form of written characters, so long as the university\nalso provides the opportunity for students to learn traditional “complex” characters\n(used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and many diaspora communities) and to learn\nnon-mainland vocabulary. A review of the entire set of Hanban textbooks used by CIs\nundertaken for this report finds they contain no overt political content. Only in one\nof six levels of textbook was there a single lesson on US-China relations, and it was a\nspeech by former president Barack Obama, in which he asserted that the United States\ndoes not seek to “contain” China. Nor have we found any evidence of interference by\nUniversities\n43\nCIs in the mainstream Chinese studies curricula on US campuses to date. (See below\nfor our recommendations concerning CIs.)\nChinese Students and Scholars Associations\nChinese Students and Scholars Associations (CSSA) on American campuses maintain\nregular contact with China’s diplomatic missions in the US. Even when these contacts\nare purely for cultural purposes, the CSSA provides a ready channel or entry point\nfor the political departments of China’s embassy and consulates in the US to gather\ninformation and coordinate action, which in some cases includes pressuring the\nbehavior of Chinese students. Sometimes pressure is even applied by China’s security\nservices on the family members of those students it finds speaking out in unacceptable\nways back in China. What is more, Chinese scholars and diplomats have sought to\ninfluence on-campus debates in China’s favors and have even protested when American\nuniversities have exercised their right to invite speakers whom China identifies as\nunfriendly. Finally, some Chinese students and scholars have exploited the collaborative\nresearch environment on US campuses to obtain sensitive American technologies.\nChinese Students and Scholars Associations now exist on approximately 150 US\ncampuses. 19 A second type of on-campus association has also recently started up,\nthe China Development Student Think Tank (CDSTT), with chapters at Syracuse\nUniversity, Boston University, and George Washington University. As voluntary\nassociations of Chinese citizens on campus, these groups perform many appropriate\nsocial functions, such as orienting new students to life in the United States and\narranging networking get-togethers. Nonetheless, their links with Chinese diplomatic\nmissions and some of their activities, because of their attempts to interfere with\nother campus activities and broader political discourse and debate, present cause for\nconcern. CSSAs at Washington, DC, universities make no secret of their ties to the\nChinese embassy and receive small amounts of operating funds directly from it. CSSAs\nelsewhere have similar ties to nearby Chinese consulates, which also provide them\nwith funding, other kinds of support, and surveillance. It has also been reported that\nChinese Communist Party cells have been established on several US campuses. 20\nCSSAs often alert PRC diplomatic missions about events on campus that offend official\nPRC political sensitivities, e.g., speeches or discussions on Tibet, Taiwan, Xinjiang, human\nrights, and Chinese elite politics. Once notified, the local PRC mission has sometimes\ncontacted university faculty or staff members to prevent such events from proceeding.\nIn some instances, it is difficult to know whether opposition to events originates with\na CSSA or the local PRC mission. In 2017, the CSSA at the University of California San\nDiego mobilized opposition to the chancellor’s invitation to the Dalai Lama to be the\ncommencement speaker, which at least some CSSA members ultimately coordinated with\nthe PRC consulate in Los Angeles. 21 After the event finally took place anyway as planned,\nSection 4\n44\nthe Chinese government retaliated by banning students and scholars with funding from\nthe Chinese government’s China Scholarship Council from attending UCSD. Other US\nuniversities have come under similar pressure when they have contemplated inviting\nthe Dalai Lama or his associates to campus. Academic authorities at one Washington,\nDC, university were even warned by the Chinese embassy that if an event concerning\nXinjiang went ahead, they risked losing their Confucius Institute.\nCSSAs also serve as a channel of political “peer monitoring” of Chinese students,\nconstraining the academic freedom of Chinese students on campus—and thereby\nalso undermining core principles of free speech and academic freedom. This issue has\nbecome more serious over the past several years, as the political environment in China\nhas tightened and Chinese students widely fear that things they say on campus (even\nin class, at other campus activities, or in private conversations) that contradict official\nPRC policies are liable to be reported to the Chinese authorities and risk putting their\nfamilies into jeopardy back home.\nA very public example of this kind took place during the commencement ceremonies\nat the University of Maryland in May 2017, after a Chinese student was selected as the\ncommencement speaker. When Yang Shuping praised the “fresh air of free speech” and\ncontrasted what she had found in the United States with China—and her comments\nwent viral on the internet and social media in China—she received an avalanche of\nemail threats, and her family in China was harassed. 22 Another well-reported incident\noccurred at Duke University in 2008 when a twenty-year-old female undergraduate\nstudent became caught up in a pro-Tibetan independence demonstration. She was\nvilified online, and her parents were harassed back in China. 23 In other cases, Chinese\ngovernment authorities have visited students’ families in China and warned them\nabout their children’s allegedly subversive statements abroad.\nIn Australia, another kind of disturbing phenomenon has occurred: Several instances\nhave occurred in which Chinese students have recorded professors’ lectures that were\ndeemed critical of the PRC and then uploaded them onto the internet, thereby\nprompting harassment of the lecturers on social media. 24 There is no evidence that this\nhas occurred on American campuses to date. But the presence on campus of a student\norganization linked to the Chinese government creates an understandable concern\nthat faculty lecturing on politically sensitive topics might fear that their lectures are\nbeing monitored and thus self-censor themselves. This prospect is especially concerning\nwhen it involves a faculty member who, because he or she needs to travel to China for\nresearch or other professional purposes, feels under duress.\nGifts and Grants\nThanks to growing wealth accumulation in China, prosperous Chinese are beginning\nto develop the practice of philanthropy and to exercise giving both at home and\nUniversities\n45\nabroad. 25 This is potentially a good thing for American universities. Indeed, since 2011,\nChinese sources have participated in at least 1,186 donations or contracts worth more\nthan $426 million to seventy-seven American universities, according to disclosures\nmade to the US Department of Education, making China the fifth most active country\nby number of gifts, and fourth, behind Qatar, England, and Saudi Arabia, in total\nmonetary value of gifts. (These disclosures are only required of universities that accept\nfederal aid, and the figures also include funds from Taiwanese sources.) 26\nAll US institutions of higher education cultivate lifetime giving from both graduates\nand their families. Given the numbers of Chinese students matriculating from\nAmerican universities and the wealth of many of their families back in China as well\nas their own potential career earnings, Chinese students have become a growing\npriority for university development officers. Indeed, some Chinese families also\nseem to believe that they can ensure, or at least enhance, their children’s chances\nof acceptance into top colleges through charitable gifts. 27\nGiven the government’s extensive role in China’s economy, acceptance of all Chinese\ngifts and grants requires due diligence that should be above and beyond the standard\npractices currently employed by universities for other charitable giving. This is\nobviously the case when funding comes from the Chinese government itself, for\nexample via the Hanban (the oversight body of the Confucius Institutes), which doles\nout research grants via its Confucius China Studies Program, 28 the “Young Sinologists”\nprogram of the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 29\nand, in one instance, the endowing of a faculty position at Stanford University.\nChinese corporate and private donors are now also starting to pour millions of\ndollars into the US educational system, think tanks, and nonprofit organizations.\nGiven that privately owned companies in China exist and prosper at the sufferance\nof political authorities there, even seemingly independent actors are often likely to\nact at government direction or in ways that they believe will please the government.\nMajor mainland Chinese and Hong Kong companies and individuals with active\nbusiness ventures in China have now pledged or donated substantial funds to\nUS universities.\nThis is also the case with some Hong Kong-based or US-based foundations that are\nlinked directly or indirectly to the Chinese government or to enterprises and families\nthat have prospered with the help of the Beijing government. The most notable case is\nthe China-United States Exchange Foundation. 30 CUSEF was established in 2008 on the\ninitiative of former Hong Kong chief executive and shipping magnate Tung Chee Hwa\n(C.H. Tung) who continues to be the chairman of the foundation. Tung is also the vice\nchairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China’s\nhighest-level “united front” organization 31 and he attended the Communist Party’s\n19 th Congress in October 2017. Moreover, the number of mainland-based members of\nSection 4\n46\nthe foundation’s official advisors and the foundation’s easy connections with Chinese\ngovernment organs belie the foundation’s assertion that it is independent of the\nChinese Communist Party and the PRC government.\nCUSEF undertakes a range of programs aimed at Americans that can accurately be\ndescribed as “influence-seeking activities”; as such, it has registered in the United\nStates under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Its lobbying activities include\nsponsoring all-expense-paid tours of China for delegations composed of what the\nfoundation’s website refers to as “thought leaders,” including journalists and editors,\nthink-tank specialists, and city and state officials. 32 CUSEF has not often collaborated\nwith American universities and think tanks, but it recently offered funding to the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin for its China Public Policy Center. However, after receiving\ncriticism from Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and others, the university declined the grant. 33\nCUSEF grants have generally gone to leading US think tanks, such as the Brookings\nInstitution, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and the Asia Society.\nThere have not yet been many offers by Chinese donors—private, corporate, or\ngovernment—to fund faculty positions or centers for Chinese studies on US campuses,\nalthough many universities are believed to be seeking such gifts. In one instance in\n2014, a leading Washington, DC, university was approached by a Chinese university\nwith a proposal for a $500,000 annual grant to establish a Center for Chinese studies in\npartnership with the Chinese university. 34 The Chinese side had three main conditions\nfor the grant: (1) that a series of Chinese officials and other visitors would be given public\nplatforms for frequent speeches; (2) that faculty from the Chinese partner university\ncould teach China courses on the US university campus; and (3) that new Chinese\nStudies courses would be added to the university curriculum. The Washington-based\nuniversity turned down the lucrative offer, on the advice of its Chinese studies faculty.\nIn August 2017, the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International\nStudies (SAIS) announced that it had received a substantial gift from CUSEF for\nan endowed junior faculty position, as well as program funding for a “Pacific\nCommunity Initiative.” SAIS administrators stated that there were no political or\nother strings attached to these grants, despite media insinuations to the contrary. 35\nAt Yale Law School, the China Law Center founded in 1999 was renamed the Paul\nTsai China Center after receiving a $30 million endowment from Joseph C. Tsai, a\nTaiwanese Canadian billionaire who is a cofounder and executive vice chairman of the\nChina-based Alibaba Group. 36 Tsai, an alumnus of Yale College and Yale Law School,\nmade the gift in honor of his father, also an alumnus of Yale Law School.\nChina is not the only authoritarian government that has given or facilitated gifts\nto American academic institutions or think tanks, but it is the wealthiest. There\nis no evidence so far that any of these gifts has compromised the independence\nof the recipient institution. But the trend toward large gifts from Chinese sources,\nUniversities\n47\nmany with some kind of government linkage underscores the need for vigilance in\nenforcing a stricter code of due diligence and transparency on the part of university\nadministrations and faculties.\nPressure on University Administrations\nThere are a large number of successful exchange programs between American and\nChinese universities. Three US universities have developed campuses in China (Johns\nHopkins, Duke, NYU), more than one hundred universities participate in cooperativeeducation\nprograms in China, and countless US faculty members participate in\ncollaborative projects with Chinese colleagues (principally in the sciences). These\nrelationships have not been easy to establish or maintain, but they have generally\nbeen successful. A 2016 report by the Government Accounting Office, which reviewed\nthe cooperative programs of twelve American universities, found that the universities\n“generally indicated that they experienced academic freedom,” while noting that\nself- and internet censorship remains a problem.\nIn recent years, the outlook for these collaborations has deteriorated in line with\nbroader restrictions on academic freedom on Chinese campuses. In 2013, and\ncommensurate with CCP Central Committee Document No. 9, universities were\nreportedly instructed to avoid discussing topics including “universal values” and civil\nrights, 37 and admonitions against teaching of Western values have continued. Since\n2017, foreign university collaborative institutions have been required to institute\nCommunist Party committees and place a Party secretary on their management\nboards. 38 In July 2018, the Ministry of Education ended 234, or one-fifth, of its\ninternational university partnerships. More than twenty-five programs with\nAmerican universities were among them. 39\nThe Chinese government has demonstrated a penchant for turning to these\ncollaborations as points of leverage when US universities have hosted the Dalai\nLama or held other events deemed politically sensitive or offensive to the Chinese\ngovernment. In such instances, existing collaborative exchange programs have been\nsuspended or put on hold, planned visits of university administrators have been\ncanceled, programs between university institutes and centers have been suspended,\nand Chinese students wishing to study at these US institutions have been counseled\nto go elsewhere. Such punitive actions resulting from campus visits by the Dalai Lama\nhave been taken against Emory University, the University of Maryland, the University\nof California–San Diego, and others. In the case of the University of Maryland, which\nhosted the Dalai Lama in 2013, there was temporary fallout, and then following the\n2017 graduation incident the Chinese government again halted cooperation, seriously\ndamaging one of the most extensive exchange programs with China.\nSection 4\n48\nSuch cases establish a worrying precedent of Chinese intrusion into American\nacademic life. The message from China to US universities is clear: Do not transgress the\npolitical no-go zones of the Chinese Communist Party or government, or you will pay\na price. Sometimes the pressure is overt; other times it is more subtle and indirect, but\nno less alarming. Some American faculty members report troubling conversations with\nuniversity administrators who continue to view Chinese students as such a lucrative\nrevenue stream that it should not be endangered by “needlessly irritating Chinese\nauthorities.”\nCensorship and Self-Censorship\nThe final category of troubling Chinese influence on American campuses involves the\nvexing issue of self-censorship among faculty and students in Chinese studies. 40 In a\nmuch-quoted essay, Perry Link described censorship within China as the use of vague\nthreats to induce academics, writers, and others to self-limit what they say; he called\nthis “the anaconda in the chandelier” syndrome. 41 More recently, the phenomenon\nhas begun to loom over scholars working outside China, and the Chinese government\nhas started deploying a variety of techniques to also encourage self-censorship beyond\nChina’s borders, including in the United States. In some cases, this syndrome has led to\noutright self-censorship of academic work. To cite some of the most egregious examples:\n• Denial of visas to qualified scholars and students seeking access to China for\nresearch or training purposes. The State Department estimates that fifteen to\ntwenty individuals are on an outright “black list,” while scores of others appear\nto be on a “gray” list, where denials are less absolute and sometimes temporary\nor limited only to certain categories of visa. But being cast into the “gray” status\nhelps create exactly the kind of uncertainty about what behavior might lead to\nvisa denial, thus inducing self-censorship in the hopes of not offending anyone\nfurther, much less turning one’s status from “gray” to “black.” In other words,\nthe power to withhold or deny access through the issuance of visas affords the\nChinese government a full spectrum of powerful control mechanisms over\nscholars.\n• Denial of access to interviewees, archives, libraries, and research institutes, even\nwhen visas are granted.\n• Restriction of visiting scholar status for American researchers to a few institutes\nunder the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and\nsome universities. Other think tanks and research institutes do not permit foreign\nresident researchers. At the same time, it should be noted, Chinese researchers\nfrom a wide variety of institutes are free to regularly come to US universities and\nthink tanks for short- and long-term stays.\nUniversities\n49\n• Attempts to control the agendas, participant name lists, what is written, and\nwhat is said at joint scholarly conferences held in China, and now sometimes\neven in the United States. (A recent technique is to require that a talk or paper\nby an American participant in a Chinese organized event be handed over to the\norganizing group for vetting well before the event itself, so a participant can be\ndisinvited, if necessary.)\n• Restriction of internet and email communications when in China.\n• Monitoring, even following, some American scholars by security services while\nin China.\n• Demands for censorship by foreign publishers of their digital content as a\ncondition for allowing it to be made available online in China.\n• Insistence on censorship of Chinese-language editions of foreign books by the\nState Press & Publishing Administration. This places foreign authors in the\ndifficult position of having to acquiesce to such censorship in order to have\ntranslations of their books published in China.\n• Censorship of online archives of PRC journals and publications, such as\nthe China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database. American\nuniversities each pay tens of thousands of dollars annually for access to these\nelectronic databases. However, recent research has shown that CNKI in particular\nis now “curating” its catalogs and holdings by deleting articles the current\ngovernment appears not to wish to see remaining in the historical record. 42 Since\nAmerican universities have started to dispose of paper copies of many of the\njournals carried in CNKI (China National Knowledge Information) periodical\nindex, this amounts to PRC distorting the historical record, not just for China\nbut for the entire world.\nIn addition to these specific restrictions affecting American scholars, the PRC\ngovernment also influences the field of Chinese studies in the United States (and\nelsewhere) via controls over key regions of their country (especially minority areas\nsuch as Tibet and Xinjiang) and by putting no-go zones around a wide variety of\nresearch subjects within the broader areas of politics, religion, ethnography, and civil\nsociety that cannot be researched in-country. As a result, American professors cannot\nthemselves work in these areas, nor can they in good conscience advise their graduate\nstudents to work on these subjects either because of risk to the researcher’s career, as\nwell as to the human subjects whom researchers would be observing or interviewing.\nSuch restrictions have real consequences for the open future of Chinese studies around\nthe world.\nSection 4\n50\nConclusion and Recommendations\nUS-China academic exchanges are valuable to both China and the United States and\nshould be maintained and developed. However, in doing so, universities must be alert\nto the risks of engaging with the Chinese government, institutions, and funders and\nbe proactive in applying a higher level of due diligence and vigilance as a defense of\nthe core principle of academic freedom, especially when conflicts take place at home\nin their own universities.\nPromote Transparency\nConfucius Institutes We do not endorse calls for Confucius Institutes to be closed,\nas long as several conditions are met. US institutions should make their CI agreements\npublic to facilitate oversight by members of the university community and other\nconcerned parties. Those agreements, in turn, must grant full managerial authority\nto the host institution (not on a shared basis with the Hanban), so the university has\nfull control over what a CI teaches, the activities it undertakes, the research grants it\nmakes, and whom it employs. The clause in all Hanban contracts that CIs must operate\n“according to China’s laws” must be deleted.\nIf these standards cannot be attained, then the CI agreements should be terminated.\nFurthermore, universities should prevent any intervention by CIs in curricular\nrequirements and course content in their overall Chinese studies curricula or other\nareas of study by maintaining a clear administrative separation between academic\ncenters and departments on the one hand, and CIs on the other. Finally, universities\nmust ensure that all public programming offered by their CIs conform to academic\nstandards of balance and diversity and do not cross the line to become a platform\nfor PRC propaganda, or even a circumscribed view of a controversial issue. In fact,\nthis report would suggest that universities not permit Confucius Institutes to become\ninvolved in public programming that goes beyond the CI core mission of education\nabout Chinese language and culture. To go beyond these two categories invites\nopportunities for politicized propaganda.\nApply Due Diligence To minimize the risks just identified, universities must rigorously\napply far stricter due-diligence procedures to scrutinize the sources and purposes of\ngifts and contracts from China to ensure that they do not interfere with academic\nfreedom. Universities accepting gifts from Chinese nationals, corporations, or\nfoundations must insist that there be no restrictions on academic freedom. Foreign\ndonations should continue to be welcomed, but universities must ensure that the\nconditions of acceptance are reasonable, consonant with their principles, subject to\noversight, and do not allow the program to become a beachhead for inappropriate\ninfluence. It is important that all universities exercise high standards of due diligence\nand not only scrutinize the source of the gift but consider the implications of such\nUniversities\n51\nthings as naming rights. Above all, they must insist that the terms of each gift\nimpose no restrictions on academic freedom. The activities of all chairs, centers,\nand projects funded by Chinese support need to be fully transparent and supervised\nby independent faculty committees and university administrators, who must bear\nin mind that even when a joint project, research grant, or gift has undergone due\ndiligence and has no explicit or evident strings attached, it can still produce a natural\nsense of obligation because no institution wants to offend a generous donor. This is a\nproblem, not restricted to grants from China, but one that is deeply entrenched in the\nfund-raising structure on which American institutions of higher education depend for\ntheir well-being.\nDefend Academic Freedom Faculty governance is the core technique for protecting\nacademic freedom in American universities and is the key to their leading role in\nresearch and teaching. It takes various forms in various institutions, but its key\nprinciples must be applied consistently to interactions involving China. Transparency\nmust be maintained in the terms of a university’s contracts with all outside actors,\nwhether individuals, foundations, donors, or collaborating institutions such as the\nHanban, which funds Confucius Institutes. Such actors must be subject to regular\noversight by faculty bodies and by administrators answerable to faculty bodies so that\nfaculty, students, visiting scholars, and others associated with the university in an\nacademic capacity will have uncompromised freedom of speech, research, teaching,\nand programmatic activities.\nUniversities and their associated institutions—such as university presses—must\nrefuse all forms of censorship of—or interference in—their publications, conferences,\ncurricula, participants in events, and other academic activities. Some universities have\nformal rules barring such censorship, but they need to increase awareness, training,\nand enforcement. Other universities may need to enact or update such rules. While\nmaintaining the openness of US universities to Chinese students, scholars, and\nresearchers, universities should push for reciprocity from Chinese partner institutions\nwith respect to various forms of research access.\nIn short, universities should enhance protection for faculty and students—especially\ninternational students—from interference in their academic freedom, and campuses\nwith large numbers of international students from authoritarian countries should\nintroduce training for students on their academic rights in the American educational\nsystem, and on the proper distance that independent student organizations should\nmaintain from government actors. Finally, universities should provide a confidential\ncomplaint procedure for students who feel they have come under pressure that\nthreatens their academic freedom, and university advisors should stand prepared to\ncounsel and assist these students to deal appropriately with such pressures.\nSection 4\n52\nPromote Integrity\nBe Alert to Risks The primary risk is of inappropriate influence over admissions,\ncourse content, and program activities stemming from the influence of Chinese\ngovernment-linked donors, diplomatic missions, student groups, and institutions.\nThis is not a new challenge for US university administrators and development officers.\nThey have dealt with political quid pro quos from donors from South Korea, Taiwan,\nJapan, Israel, Russia, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and other countries in the past and\ncurrently, and American universities have long learned how to refuse donations with\nstrings attached. This historical experience and the existing safeguards should also\nhelp inform and guide US universities when it comes to dealing with this new wave of\nChinese money. Faculty and administrators must continue to protect the open debate,\ndiversity of opinion, freedom of expression, faculty autonomy, and transparency on\nwhich the health and reputation of their institutions are based. Funding from Chinese\nsources should be as welcome as funding from other sources, but only to the extent\nthat fundamental academic values can be maintained and protected.\nA second risk is a loss of sensitive or proprietary technology through academic\ninstruction of cooperation. There are indications that the US government is now\nstrengthening measures to protect the theft of sensitive technology and intellectual\nproperty that is being developed on US campuses. These measures may require\nheightened screening and, in some cases, outright denial of visas to individuals from\ncertain state-run institutions or even from certain sensitive research fields. Such\ncalls have understandably prompted concern from the academic community fearing\nthat this will undermine the principles of academic freedom, hinder collaboration,\nand deny American universities access to a rich talent pool. These reservations are\nmerited and require that any tightening of visa categories be as narrow as possible.\nFor their part, universities will of course have to comply with whatever regulations are\nimposed. They should, additionally, proactively review and update their procedures\nfor protecting both proprietary and classified research. They should also enter into\nfar closer collegial discussions with one another, relevant professional associations,\nand government agencies to collectively refine solutions to the difficult problem of\nbalancing the pursuit of innovation and academic freedom with preventing the theft\nof technology and other IP.\nTo meet these challenges, American universities may need to update their rules and\nintensify faculty and researcher training and institutional oversight for protection of\nproprietary research information. Some US universities refuse to accept contracts for\nclassified research. Those that do accept such contracts must comply with government\nregulations for the protection of research findings. But all research universities\nconduct research that produces valuable intellectual property, which is proprietary\nin various proportions to the funder. And so, it is necessary for the university and\nUniversities\n53\nresearchers to intensify efforts to protect their proprietary intellectual property\nfrom loss.\nPromote Reciprocity\nThe academic community nationwide should work toward a common set of principles\nand practices for protecting academic freedom and promote greater reciprocity.\nTo prevent influencers from using divide-and-conquer strategies (by rewarding\nsome institutions while punishing others), it is important for the national academic\ncommunity as a whole to come together to formulate and implement these principles.\nUS universities should not only work together but they should also work with other\nuniversities around the world to develop a “Code of Conduct” for acceptable and\nunacceptable practices in academic exchanges with Chinese institutions and funders.\n(The section on think tanks in this section recommends similar measures.) The\nacademic community and government should also monitor instances where Chinese\nentities may acquire financially challenged American colleges outright, ensuring that\ntheir academic integrity is not compromised. 43\nUniversities can and must continue to play a positive role in the US-China relationship.\nIndeed, by introducing international students to American life and values, and\nconnecting them to new personal and professional relationships, universities are\narguably the important means by which the United States exercises its soft power.\nGenerally—but not always—individuals undergoing such an experience take a more\npositive view of the country. Unfortunately, as Chinese students contribute much, not\nleast monetarily, to American universities, universities have been too slow to help them\nintegrate themselves more organically into campus life. As a result, Chinese students\nreport unacceptably high levels of depression and isolation or simply clubbing up with\neach other. 44 While acting to mitigate the risks of improper interference, universities\nmust not forget their obligations to these students nor lose sight of the far greater\nopportunity to advance cooperation and understanding.\nNOTES\n1 ​This process is well documented in Li, Cheng (ed.).

For this reason, they are high-value targets for\nlobbying and influence activities by foreign governments and nongovernmental actors,\nincluding those from the People’s Republic of China.\nThink tanks in the United States date to the early twentieth century, when industrial\ncapital and private philanthropy (led by the likes of Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller,\nAndrew W. Mellon, and Henry Ford) began to endow private nonprofit research\ninstitutions at a time when there was increasing government demand for expertise on\na growing range of public policy issues. Over the past century, think tanks have come\nto play ever more vital roles in the American public policy process, and they contribute\nboth directly and indirectly to public education, a richer public dialogue via the\nmedia, greater civic engagement, and better-informed government policy formulation.\nOf the approximately 1,800 think tanks in the United States today, about half are\nresearch institutions located within US universities. For the purpose of this section,\nhowever, only those think tanks located in nonuniversity private sector settings are\nconsidered. Most of these think tanks and research institutions enjoy tax-exempt\nstatus under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which stipulates that\nthey are restricted from legislative lobbying as “action organizations.” Institutions that\nreceive this tax-exempt status must either be charitable philanthropic organizations or\nresearch organizations (think thanks) that operate in a supposedly nonpartisan way\nand in the general public interest. Because they are largely privately funded through\ndonor contributions, US think tanks compete tenaciously for support, professional\nexpertise, and public impact.\nRoles of Think Tanks in American Society\nThe universe of think tanks in the United States is very diverse, and each think tank\nperforms different missions for different audiences and clients through different means\nof output. Four roles are especially relevant to discussions of Chinese interest and\npotential influence seeking.\nThe first and most important role is educating the public and better informing the\n“policy community.” The majority of mainstream think tanks consciously perform\nthese functions through a variety of mechanisms: publishing books, articles in\n58\njournals, shorter “policy briefs,” or “op-eds,” and by contributing to policy “task\nforce” reports on specific issues; holding public seminars, briefings, and conferences;\nspeaking to the print, television, radio, and electronic media; and maintaining\ninformational websites that disseminate publications of the think-tank videos of\nevents on a worldwide basis.\nThe second role is to influence government policy. This is done through face-toface\nmeetings with government officials, providing testimony before congressional\ncommittees, track-two discussions, emails and other communications aimed at\ntargeted audiences, and a wide variety of publications.\nThe third role, undertaken by some, but not all, US policy think tanks, is to provide\nspecific research on a contractual basis for government agencies that is generally not\nfor public consumption.\nThe fourth role is to provide personnel to go into government service for fixed periods\nof time through the famous American “revolving door,” whereby think tanks become\n“governments in waiting” for ex- and would-be officials until just after an election,\nwhen there is usually a large-scale turnover of personnel in Washington as each new\nadministration is formed.\nIn American think tanks, selection of general research topics can be influenced by\noutside sources (management, external funding agencies, or government policy\nshifts). But the final selection is usually subject to mutual agreement, and the findings\nof research are not supposed to be dictated by outside pressures. At the same time,\nboth US think tanks and university research institutes are expected to maintain\nanalytical independence from their funders. If the funding body does seek to interfere\nwith a research project or promote its own agenda, there is an established expectation\nthat its funding should be rejected. More often than not, there is a process of\nmutual consultation between researcher, think tank, and potential external\nfunding bodies—through which interests are de-conflicted and grants are negotiated\nto the mutual satisfaction of all parties. While this is the optimal scenario, there have\nbeen cases revealed in the US media in recent years in which such principles were\nabridged.\nThe Role of China in American Think Tanks\nIt is against this general backdrop that the role of expanding Chinese influence on\nAmerican think tanks needs to be considered. What follows are the findings gleaned\nthrough interviews with seventeen think-tank analysts from eleven Washington- and\nNew York–based think tanks 1 that explore the nature of interactions that US think-tank\nspecialists have recently been having with Chinese counterparts. The analysts are all\nThink Tanks\n59\nrecognized China experts (with the exception of one who is more broadly an Asia\nexpert but has extensive experience with China-related projects) who have served as\ndirectors of programs or centers in their respective institutions. About half have served\nin the US government. One directs a think tank that is partially supported by Chinese\ngovernment funds. The interviews were all conducted in 2018.\nChina has become a priority field for US think tanks concerned with international\nrelations, and most now have staff members (often several) devoted to researching and\npublishing on China. Many possess PhD degrees, Chinese language skills, and have\nlived in or visited China over many years with some originally from the PRC. Some\nstay on staff for many years, while others work on short-term (two- or three‐year)\ncontracts. Most think tanks also employ student research assistants and interns\n(including those from China).\nThere is significant interaction between American and Chinese think tanks—as\nthink-tank researchers need to visit China as well as host and receive visitors in the United\nStates to be well informed and to perform their own research work. Most interviewees\nreported hosting or participating in ad hoc meetings in their home institutions with\nvisiting Chinese officials or scholars on a regular basis; although two do not host any\nmeetings with Chinese, they will attend such events if hosted by others. All but one\nof the interviewees travel to China for their work: to deliver lectures, to participate in\nconferences or Track 1.5 or Track 2 dialogues, and to do research for articles, books,\nand reports.\nA number of scholars noted a marked shift in the nature of their interactions with\nChinese colleagues and research projects over the past few years. While longstanding\nTrack 2 dialogues continue on issues such as cyber policy, nuclear policy,\nand US-China interactions in third countries and regions, overall they seem not as\nopen, robust, and productive as in the past. Indeed, several long-standing Track 2\ndialogues have been curtailed or stopped altogether—with scholars reporting that\nit is increasingly difficult to establish sustained dialogues that are meaningful with\nChinese think tanks because of new rules, restrictions, and uncertainties. For instance,\nChinese institutions (both think tanks and universities) must now obtain central-level\ngovernment approval, such as vetting dialogue topics and foreign participants, before\nbeing able to host foreign participants in China. New Chinese government regulations\ngenerally limit Chinese think-tank scholars and university professors to one foreign\ntrip per year, and even go so far as to hold passports to make even personal travel more\ndifficult.\nWhen dialogues do occur, another noticeable recent trend has been a decline in\ncandor and greater uniformity in what Chinese interlocutors say. One US think tanker\nnoted, “The conversations have declined in productivity,” while another commented\nSection 5\n60\nthat he had “moved away from Track 2 because China does not have much to say\nbeyond the Xi Catechism. Even in private conversations, we are not getting anything\ninteresting.” And yet another indicated that he no longer participates in many joint\nevents because they need to be “framed in a way to fit the Chinese narrative, including\nthe speakers, agenda, topics and writing.” Achieving true candor in such dialogues\nwith the Chinese side has long been difficult, as Chinese interlocutors routinely stick\nto “talking points” and stock slogans, stay strictly “on message,” and are afraid to say\nanything in front of their peers that might subsequently get them in political trouble\nback home.\nOne US analyst commented that at a recent conference in Beijing, Chinese scholars\ndemonstrated little interest in putting forth ideas for cooperation, a marked change\nfrom earlier meetings. This individual believes that tensions in the US-China\nrelationship are at least partially responsible. And it is not only the Americans who\nsee less utility in such dialogues. One Track 2 initiated by the Chinese side concerning\nglobal norm cooperation ended abruptly when the Chinese said they did not see any\nproductive benefits, despite the willingness of the US side to move forward with the\nproject.\nWhile these are long-standing problems, they have gotten demonstratively worse\nduring the Xi Jinping era. As one think tank scholar commented, “Collaboration\nhas become much more difficult, more authoritarian, and finding a common\ndefinition of a program is more difficult. We could usually find areas on which to\nwork collaboratively, but there is a gap in worldview.” One US think tank analyst who\ndirects an innovative program to foster dialogue among rising American and Chinese\nstrategic thinkers, which used to be hosted alternately in both China and the United\nStates, has moved the program entirely out of China because of the repressive political\natmosphere. Another institution has transitioned away from cooperative projects with\nChina to emphasize bolstering the capacity of other countries in their dealings with\nChina.\nMany US think tank scholars have also become concerned that the relationship\nbetween Chinese and American scholars has regressed into a one-way street—with\nAmericans providing intelligence to Chinese interlocutors, whose main purpose is to\ntake the information back to their government. Indeed, some Chinese interlocutors\narrive in the offices of American think tanks with barely disguised “shopping lists”\nof questions, which are presumably set by government “taskers” in Beijing. This is\na regular occurrence, but it tends to spike when a high-level governmental visit or\nsummit meeting is pending. A related Chinese goal is to transmit Chinese government\npolicy perspectives to American think-tank counterparts.\nThink Tanks\n61\nSince 2010, American (and other foreign) researchers have encountered a\nprogressively more restrictive research environment in China. One American scholar\nnoted that a previous research project that involved on-the-ground interviews\nacross many provinces was no longer possible. The registration and information\nrequirements of the 2017 Law on the Management of Foreign NGOs is part of the\nproblem, she believes, by severely constraining opportunities to conduct joint\nprojects and research in China. It has also become exceedingly difficult to arrange\ninterviews with Chinese think-tank scholars and government officials; many\ninstitutional libraries are now off-limits; central-level archives are inaccessible\nwith provincial and local ones also increasingly circumscribed; survey research is\nimpossible (unless in partnership with an approved Chinese counterpart, which is\nincreasingly hard to find); and other bureaucratic impediments make it increasingly\ndifficult for foreign think-tank researchers to undertake their basic jobs of\nresearching China. At the same time, Chinese researchers working in the US are able\nto schedule appointments easily with their American counterparts and government\nofficials, enjoy open access to American libraries and government archives, are able\nto conduct surveys anywhere, and may travel freely around the United States to do\nfield work.\nUS Think-Tank Centers in China\nOnly two American think tanks operate real satellite centers in Beijing, and one does\nso in Hong Kong. Both Beijing centers are cohosted by, and located on, the campus\nof Tsinghua University. One has a robust program of research by Chinese fellows,\nbrings in people from the think tank’s other centers, has a young ambassador program\nfor Americans and Chinese, and boasts a “wide open internet.” One center uses its\nfacilities primarily for presentations from the resident fellows and other visitors. Some\ntalks are open to the public, but most are restricted to faculty and graduate students.\nThe center’s ambitions were originally greater: for example, to host a set of annual\nconferences with senior experts and officials on both sides. However, the Chinese side\ncould not live up to its side of the bargain, demanding that senior US officials attend\nwhile not delivering Chinese officials of equivalent rank.\nThese two centers have also become caught up within the increasingly strained\nUS-China relationship as well as the tightening political atmosphere inside China.\nAccording to one affiliated research fellow, “connections with the center are a liability\nbecause institutions and people can cause you problems if you don’t say the right\nthings.” At least one of the centers in Greater China has occasionally limited its public\nprogramming from addressing sensitive political issues, because it did not want to\njeopardize the institution’s presence in China and Asia. Yet that think tank’s other\nstaffers and fellows have also proved adept at circumventing political restrictions by,\nSection 5\n62\nin one instance, inviting a well-known Hong Kong activist denied access at one center\nevent to participate in an event at the US headquarters later.\nChinese Outreach to US Think Tanks\nChinese outreach to American think tanks takes several forms, including via embassy\nand consular officials, Chinese think-tank scholars, and representatives of China’s\nstate-run media.\nEmbassy and Consular Officials\nChinese embassy and consular officials meet frequently with many (but not all) of\nthe interviewees. Sometimes their aim is to assess Americans’ views on particular\nissues or offer feedback on particular articles (generally those that are critical of\nChina). In one case, for example, a Chinese official stated that a particular analyst’s\nunderstanding was “too gloomy,” and in another that a scholar “didn’t have the\ncorrect data.” One think-tank scholar noted that Chinese officials use both threats\nand praise to try to influence her. On the one hand, they took her to lunch and\nexpressed “concern with her mind set” indicating that she just “just do[es] not\nunderstand the situation.” But embassy and Chinese government officials can also be\neffusive in their praise and offers of assistance, suggesting that she “knows too much\nabout Chinese policy.”\nOftentimes officials ask for meetings with think tankers to transmit messages after\nimportant Communist Party or government events. After the annual meeting of\nChina’s legislature (the National People’s Congress) in 2018, for example, one thinktank\nanalyst was invited to lunch, only to endure an hour-and-a-half lecture on how\nUS media and analysts misunderstood the new change in presidential term limits and\nXi’s reform efforts. Another was visited by military attachés from the Chinese embassy\nin an effort to convey China’s opposition to the Taiwan Travel Act, US Defense\nAuthorization Act, possible prospects for US Navy ship visits, and submarine sales to\nTaiwan. In concluding his stern warnings, one attaché warned: “We are no longer\nweak, and can inflict pain on Taiwan, if the United States is not careful and does not\nabide by the Three Communiques.”\nOn other occasions, Chinese embassy officials ask for meetings to warn think tanks\nagainst hosting speakers on topics often related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Tibet.\nSeveral think-tank analysts reported that they or others in their institutions had\nreceived calls from senior Chinese embassy officials regarding projects related to the\nDalai Lama, in one case stating, “This is very troubling—it will have consequences.”\nAs far as the analysts were concerned, however, there turned out to be no consequences.\nAnother received a complaint from the Chinese embassy after the think tank hosted\nThink Tanks\n63\na delegation from Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)—but again there were\nno discernible consequences. In a separate case, a senior Chinese Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs official warned that a particular interactive website focusing on Chinese\nsecurity issues was “anti-China.” In response, the think tank invited contributions by\na prominent Chinese think-tank scholar: “The content of the website didn’t change,\nbut the official didn’t complain again.” In another instance, the Chinese government\nwithdrew an offer to a US think tank to host Foreign Minister Wang Yi after that think\ntank refused to disinvite a Taiwanese speaker for a separate event.\nChinese officials have also requested that US think tanks bar certain scholars or\nNGO activists from participating in discussions with senior Chinese officials. When\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke at one high-profile Washington think tank,\nthe embassy requested the guest list in advance and then demanded that several\nindividuals—including at least one senior China scholar—be disinvited. The think\ntank refused. In yet another case involving the director of the National People’s\nCongress Foreign Affairs Committee, Fu Ying, a US think tank was strongly advised\nto exclude a well-known China specialist as a condition for a meeting going forward.\nThink-tank analysts report that in most cases, but not all, such requests have been\nrejected and events continue as planned.\nGenerally speaking, PRC visitors either steer clear of or limit their contact with think\ntanks that have strong relations with, or extensive funding from, Taiwan. One analyst\nwho writes extensively on Taiwan and PRC-Taiwan relations finds that Chinese\nofficials typically do not engage with him. At one time, there was a conflict between\nan event that he was hosting for a Taiwanese official with a significant event that same\nafternoon hosted by a colleague that featured very prominent Chinese and American\nofficials. The Chinese embassy instructed them to move the Taiwan event, but they\nrefused. Both events took place with no apparent negative repercussions.\nThink Tank to Think Tank\nAs noted above, Chinese officials and think-tank counterparts reach out to American\nthink-tank China specialists for the purposes of information/intelligence collection\nand influencing US policy debates. One Chinese scholar reported to an American\nthink-tank analyst that that every time an American expert meets with a Chinese\ninterlocutor, a report is written afterward. Another Chinese visitor indicated to\na leading Washington think-tank expert that China’s Foreign Ministry has staff\ndedicated to tracking the activities and publications of about twenty leading\nAmerican-China specialists.\nAny number of Chinese think tanks sponsor meetings and conferences in China\nand the United States with American counterparts. In some instances, the Chinese\nSection 5\n64\npartners are well-known government entities. The Chinese Institute of Contemporary\nInternational Relations and the University of International Relations, both of which\nhave links to the Ministry of State Security (MSS), host conferences on US-China\nrelations and/or Track 2 dialogues. So do the Foreign Ministry–affiliated China\nInstitute of International Studies, Chinese People’s Institute for Foreign Affairs,\nand the China Foreign Affairs University. The Charhar Institute is also involved\nin such activities, although its institutional linkages are unclear.\nMore recently, Chinese think tanks professing to be independent from direct\ngovernment control have begun to actively engage US counterparts. The think-tank\nIntellisia is one such organization that has sponsored dialogues with US scholars. The\nCenter for China and Globalization is another such “independent” think tank, with\nmore than a hundred researchers and staff. According to several think-tank analysts,\nits founder and head, Wang Huiyao, actively solicits invitations to speak in US thinktank\nsettings. In May 2018, however, Senator Marco Rubio publicly questioned why\nWang’s CCP affiliations—most particularly his work with the CCP’s United Front Work\nDepartment as a standing director of the China Overseas Friendship Association—\nwere not mentioned as part of his biography in an invitation to an upcoming event at\na DC-based think tank. Despite the fact that the think tank planned to acknowledge\nWang’s position during the panel presentation, given the ensuing public scrutiny,\nWang dropped out of the event. He later appeared, however, at another US think-tank\nevent without his government affiliation noted and without provoking attention from\nany member of Congress. For such “independent” Chinese think tanks, organizing\nconferences can give them a significant boost in prestige at home. One Chinese\nthink-tank director informed an American think-tank analyst that he received several\nhundred thousand dollars from the university’s party secretary as a bonus for bringing\nsuch a prestigious delegation of Western China watchers to China.\nFinally, a group of several senior Chinese government officials and think-tank scholars\nfrom different institutions has emerged as an important generator of China-US think\ntank cooperation. This group includes such well-known figures as Fu Ying (director of\nthe NPC’s Foreign Affairs Committee), Wang Jisi (director of Peking University’s Institute\nof International and Strategic Studies), Yuan Peng (president of CICIR), and Wang Wen\n(executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University),\nwho are all well funded and able to pay for the activities of the Chinese side, as well as\ntravel and hotel stays for Americans who participate in their projects in China.\nFu Ying emerges as the senior figure in a growing number of US-China interactions.\nAccording to several think-tank analysts, she works hard to structure projects in ways\nto ensure the best possible outcome from the Chinese perspective. This includes,\nfor example, partnering primarily—although not solely—with scholars who are\nThink Tanks\n65\nconsidered to be more favorably disposed to the Chinese government perspective\nand ensuring that those with challenging views are excluded. One analyst noted that\nformer Hong Kong chief executive C.H. Tung’s and Fu’s relationships with US thinktank\nscholars and presidents provide them with frequent opportunities to speak before\nlarge public audiences at prestigious American venues and to advance an official\nChinese narrative while gaining a certain added legitimacy at home.\nFu is also explicit in her desire to cultivate relations with think-tank experts she\nbelieves may enter government. Following the election of Donald Trump, she “rushed\nin to see” one think-tank analyst with ties to the new administration and a flurry of\nembassy officials followed. However, when it became evident that said analyst would\nnot be going into the administration, there was no more interest. In addition, at a\nmeeting around a project on US-China relations advanced by Fu, she noted that she\nhoped some of the people would be entering the government; otherwise it would not\nprove to have been worth much to have done the project.\nChinese president Xi Jinping has also encouraged Chinese think tanks to “go\nglobal”—establishing a presence within the United States and other countries as\na way “to advance the Chinese narrative.” In 2015, the Institute for China-America\nStudies (ICAS) set up shop in Washington, DC, as a 501(3)(c) nonprofit organization.\nICAS is funded by the Hainan-Nanhai Research Foundation, which receives its\nseed funding from the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, a Chinese\ngovernment–supported entity, as well as from the China Institute of the University of\nAlberta, Nanjing University, and Wuhan University. The head of ICAS, Hong Nong,\nretains ties to these institutions. ICAS maintains a small staff of researchers as well\nas a diverse board of international experts from China, the United States, Canada,\nAustralia, and Indonesia. ICAS projects focus on the central issues of the US-China\nrelationship, including US-China cooperation, maritime security, North Korea, and\ntrade relations. Hong herself focuses on the South China Sea and the Arctic policies\nof non–Arctic Council member countries, of which China is the largest and most\nsignificant. The institute also holds an annual conference.\nWhile President Xi’s call to establish think tanks was contemporaneous with the\nestablishment of ICAS, Hong has made it clear that the decision to set up ICAS in DC\ncame as a result of an effort by her and some of her colleagues both in China and in\nCanada to understand better how American think tanks operate. She was asked to\nlead ICAS, and she then selected a board of directors, as well as advisory members.\nShe views the mission of the think tank as being to serve as a bridge in perception\nbetween the United States and China. Hong does not want people to view the institute\nas advancing a Chinese government perspective or as wearing a “Chinese hat,” but\nshe believes that in DC there are too few voices that reflect a Chinese (not necessarily\nSection 5\n66\ngovernment) perspective. While she acknowledges that there is not much diversity in\nthe nature of the views represented by ICAS—there is no overt criticism of Chinese\ngovernment policies—she is hopeful that once ICAS gains greater standing, it will be\nable to attract senior scholars from other institutions with a greater range of views to\nwrite for its website.\nMore recently, Chinese publishing entrepreneur Zhou Zhixing has established the\nUS-China New Perspectives Foundation, with offices in both Los Angeles and\nWashington, DC. As of yet, these offices have no track record of activities or publications.\nIt is likely that more such think tanks initiated with or without formal Chinese\ngovernment support will follow in the United States.\nThink-Tank Funding\nDifferent US think tanks have different funding models. At least one type (Federally\nFunded Research and Development Centers, or FFRDCs) is funded entirely by the\nUS government, while several others accept some US government funding, as well\nas money from other governments on a contracted work basis. Three think tanks\ninterviewed accept no US or other government funding: One is funded entirely\nby central operating funds from an endowment, while two others rely on a mix\nof foundation and private support. One think tank’s work is funded entirely by\nfoundations. Most interviewees allow Chinese funders to pay for travel and meeting\ncosts to Beijing for conferences, while a few categorically do not—either because of\nregulations or on the principle of conflict of interest.\nAt least one think tank differentiates between funding that is dedicated to its work\nin Washington and that which supports its center in China. For the center in China,\na US-based scholar has raised funds from the China Development Bank, Huawei\nCorporation, and private entrepreneurs from Hong Kong. This same think tank has a\n“China Council” of donors (including Chinese Americans, but no Chinese nationals)\nthat supports the think tank’s activities. Some US institutions refuse to accept funds\nfrom China-based commercial entities, although they are occasionally willing to\naccept donations from their US-based subsidiaries. Other think tanks, however, accept\nfunds from Chinese corporations and individual businesspeople. One has taken money\nfrom Alibaba America for a particular event celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of\nWTO accession; another has taken money from the Chinese real estate firm Vanke for\na project on the environment. A Chinese businessman, Fu Chen, supports work at one\nChina center that also has several prominent Chinese businesspersons on its board.\nOne has an advisory council with Chinese Americans, and yet another think tank\nis building an advisory council that will include Chinese, but only those who have\nbecome American citizens. (This analyst is also considering accepting private Chinese\nmoney but not money from Chinese state-owned enterprises.)\nThink Tanks\n67\nC.H. Tung and his China-US Exchange Foundation (CUSEF) have emerged as a\nleading funding source for several think tanks, providing financial assistance for a\nvariety of projects ranging from supporting book research and writing, to funding\ncollaborative projects, to promoting exchanges. CUSEF’s work in this area extends back\nto the mid-1990s (for more on CUSEF, see the section on universities in this report).\nThe interviewees differ, however, in their assessments of whether CUSEF funding\nreflects direct linkages with Beijing. As one analyst noted, “C.H. is a special figure\nbecause he is half Hong Kong and half PRC.” Another commented that he currently\nhas the potential to undertake a joint project with C.H. Tung and will “probably do\nit for the money and the contact.” Another has accepted funds for work on cultural\nexchange and climate change, while yet another is far more circumspect, describing\nMr. Tung as an “open united front agent” in his capacity as vice chair of the Chinese\nPeople’s Political Consultative Congress. Many of the partnerships CUSEF establishes in\nconjunction with US think tanks represent efforts to find common ground, particularly\nin line with PRC initiatives and policies, for example: “The New Model of Major Power\nRelationship Research Project 2014,” “Taiwan Arms Sales Research Project 2014,” and\nthe “Pacific Community Initiative.”\nCUSEF also funds a number of annual exchange programs, including for members of\nCongress, state and local officials, historically black colleges and universities, as well as\nseveral journalist delegations, including one for students of journalism. CUSEF often\npartners with the Center for American Progress, the American Foreign Policy Council,\nand the East-West Institute. However, each partnership is different. The Center for\nAmerican Progress, for example, pays its own way in its work with CUSEF. CUSEF also\nfunds projects with think-tank analysts who are not China scholars, such as a project\non US-China relations in the Arctic. One think-tank analyst who was involved in the\nCUSEF-funded “Creating a Pacific Community” project became uncomfortable with\nthe overall orientation of the project and dropped out.\nC.H. Tung is personally proactive, often visiting the United States and meeting with\nthink-tank experts. On one occasion, he encouraged an American scholar to write an\narticle together with a noted Chinese scholar on the South China Sea. He also offered\nto establish a massive program with one institute in which the think tank would train\nChinese Party School officials on free market economics (the idea was eventually\nrejected by the think tank). In addition, CUSEF has funded the publication of at least\ntwo books in which US analysts were involved. In both cases, the analysts state that\nC.H. was “hands-off” in the process. Yet, in another instance, when a US scholar\napproached the CUSEF for possible funding of a major book on US-China relations,\nthe foundation insisted on two conditions: that half of the contributors be Chinese\nscholars, and that the foundation would have the right to review the manuscript prior\nto publication. The American scholar in question refused these conditions and looked\nelsewhere for support.\nSection 5\n68\nTaiwan’s TECRO also supports work at several think tanks. In rare cases—because one\nusually excludes the other—US think tanks end up accepting funds from both Taiwan\nand mainland China sources.\nVisa Access\nMost American scholars consider travel to China an important element of their ability\nto do their job—attending conferences, participating in delegations, and undertaking\nindependent research. Given this imperative, the issue of visa access is a central one.\nWhile most analysts receive single-entry professional exchange (F) visas, a few\nroutinely receive one-year multiple-entry F visas, while some have ten-year tourist (L)\nvisas. Others receive double-entry visas, if proof of specific invitations are produced.\nOne US think-tank scholar, a Chinese national, travels to China on a Chinese passport.\nWhile ten-year multiple-entry tourist visas are, of course, optimal—there is also a serious\npotential downside: namely, that they are for “tourism,” and, according to Chinese\nlaw, professional activities are not permitted. One senior scholar who holds a ten-year\ntourist visa was recently visited and interrogated at his hotel in Beijing after several\ndays of meetings with Chinese think tanks and universities.\nSeveral think-tank analysts expressed the opinion that Chinese officials are now paying\nmore attention to the writings of American think-tank analysts—not only books,\narticles, and op-eds, but also social media. This is done not only to become familiar\nwith changing views but to catalog who is supportive and who is critical of China’s\npolicies. One scholar believes that, as a result of a comment posted on Twitter, this\nindividual was required to go to the Chinese embassy for an interview before being\ngranted a visa. This had never happened in his previous decades of China-related travel.\nIn another instance, Beijing attempted to enforce its sovereignty claims through the\nvisa process. A visa was initially denied because an American scholar had stated that\n“Hong Kong” and “Taiwan” were places he had previously visited, instead of “Hong\nKong SAR,” and “Taiwan, China.” Most of the scholars interviewed believe that the\nprocess of gaining a visa has become much more politicized and difficult in the past\nyear or two, with much more scrutiny given to an applicant’s political views. Among\nthose interviewed, only one think-tank scholar reported actually being denied a visa.\n(However, there have been reports of other think-tank analysts being rejected who\nare reluctant to go public about their denials.) In addition, most of those interviewed\nobserved that the Chinese embassy now often issues visas the day before or even the\nmorning of departure, making the visa process laborious and nerve‐racking.\nTwo interviewees reported that companies that specialize in expediting visa\napplications have indicated that their respective think tanks are on a blacklist that\nmakes obtaining visas problematic. In one case, an interviewee related a case in which\nThink Tanks\n69\na junior researcher was told not to list the think tank as her place of employment\non her visa application or it might be rejected. (To avoid this scenario, the senior\nresearcher reached out to a Chinese official to pave the way and the visa was issued.)\nIn another instance, a visa expediter was banned from doing business with the\nChinese embassy after it informed a think tank that it had landed on a list making\nit difficult to get visas.\nA senior Chinese official told one think-tank analyst that responsibility for reviewing\nvisa requests has shifted from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Ministry of\nPublic Security, thus creating many delays and difficulties. One US think-tank scholar\nreported that he has not only been advised on a number of occasions not to even\napply for a visa but also has had a planned invitation to a conference hosted by an\nAmerican company revoked because the Foreign Ministry told the company not to\ninvite him. Others have been granted visas only for “personal” trips, with the proviso\nthat they do no public speaking nor meet with anyone outside of family members or\ncultural figures.\nThink-tank scholars report that on several occasions, when one member of a\ndelegation has been in danger of not receiving a visa (or not receiving it in time),\nreaching out to the Chinese Embassy or consular officials (in one case threatening to\ncancel the delegation) has resulted in a favorable disposition. Two think tanks now\nroutinely reach out to Chinese officials before submitting applications in order to pave\nthe way. Nonetheless, a few think-tank analysts are concerned about being beholden\nto the embassy or the consulate and the shadow such dependency casts on their ability\nto continue their work. One analyst indicated that although he is asked to help other\nmembers of the think tank with their visa issues, he does not want to be in debt to the\nembassy and therefore does not offer to help proactively.\nChinese Media and Think Tanks\nThe Chinese media offer both opportunities and pitfalls to American think-tank\nanalysts. A significant part of a think-tank analyst’s job is to influence official and\npublic opinion—and the media, whether Chinese or Western, is an essential part of\nthat process. Think-tank analysts are under no illusion, however, that the Chinese\nmedia can be trusted to present their ideas as they are delivered. As one interviewee\nunderscored, “The desire of Chinese media is to make Americans see things the\nChinese way—in a positive and beneficial light—and to present positive American\nviews to the Chinese public. You have to be prepared that the Chinese media will have\nleading questions and know that they will not include critical things.” One senior\nUS scholar has had multiple experiences of censorship, and one case of fabricated\nquotations, by Chinese newspapers. It is also apparent that Chinese journalists\nSection 5\n70\nincreasingly flood public events put on by US think tanks in Washington, using the\nevents as press conferences and to pose leading questions. While Western reporters are\nnot immune to this type of behavior, the Chinese media undertake such distortions\nin a far more systematic manner, with a pointed political agenda that is usually\ndetermined by the government’s current political “line.”\nWith this in mind, US think-tank analysts have developed a varied set of approaches\nto their interactions with the Chinese media. Some see the Chinese media as an\nopportunity to get their views across to the Chinese public, even though, as one think\ntanker acknowledges, he knows he may be censored in “inappropriate ways.” Another\nstated that despite the obvious biases, he still gives a lot of interviews—to CCTV,\nCGTN, Xinhua, People’s Daily, and the Shanghai Media Group, among them. At least\none claims that while he does frequent CGTN interviews, he has never been censored.\nSeveral US think-tank scholars indicate that they keep track of their interviews, and if\nthey are misquoted, they stop speaking to that journalist. One notes that he refuses to\ndo interviews on sensitive political issues, such as party congresses. Another indicates\nhe will only do live television as a hedge against being censored, while another\nindicates he will only be interviewed in written email form. Two analysts refuse to\ngive interviews to Chinese media at all, with the exception of those that occur in\nthe immediate aftermath of a public talk when an analyst is approached by Chinese\njournalists. In one case, an analyst reported that Xinhua conducted an in-person\nbackground interview after she refused to write an op-ed, but she was willing to share\nher views (which were negative). Xinhua then drafted a full, positive-sounding op-ed\nin her name, which they planned to publish without her approval. She successfully\nblocked it, and her institute now has a blanket ban on interviews with the Chinese\npress unless there is a special reason. This is intended to send a message that they do\nnot believe the Chinese media can be trusted.\nThe opportunity to earn money through interviews was mentioned by one scholar. She\nnoted that CGTN pays $150 per interview. The network warned her, however, that if\nshe was too critical of the Chinese government, she would not be invited back. CGTN\nalso indicated that she should be “more like” another think-tank analyst who had\nbecome a regular on CGTN.\nWriting and Publishing in China\nThe majority of the think-tank analysts who have been interviewed for this section\nhave refused to write op-eds for Chinese newspapers, with several stating that they\nhave had bad experiences in which content has been censored. One scholar reports\nseveral instances of pieces being commissioned by Global Times, only to have his piece\nspiked after submission because of its controversial content. Others, however, have\nThink Tanks\n71\nwritten for Chinese publications and have not experienced any such issues. Several\nanalysts noted that they have heard that their articles and reports have been translated\ninto Chinese in neibu (internal circulation) channels for consumption by think tanks\nand government officials. One interviewee commented that if what she writes is\npositive, it is published openly; if it is critical, it is only published internally.\nA number of interviewees also reported that their work had been improperly published\non Chinese websites. Sohu has taken think-tank reports and put them online without\npermission; one analyst forced the company to take them down from the web. Another\nscholar reported that a Chinese think tank at one point claimed she was one of its\nfellows and posted bogus content on its website that it alleged she had written.\nWhile some of the think-tank scholars interviewed have had their books translated\ninto Chinese by mainland presses, most have not. A growing number do not try,\nrecognizing that significant parts of their books would never make it past the censors.\nWhen informed privately by the translator of her book that large portions were being\nexcised, one scholar halted the Chinese publication process. Another scholar battled\nfor two years with the Chinese publisher after the contract had been signed between\nthe Western and Chinese publishers. The State Press and Publishing Administration\ndemanded more than seventy deletions, finally settling on five with the agreement\nof the scholar. In the end, however, the Chinese publisher informed the scholar’s\npublisher that the book could not proceed to publication because of “unfriendly\nremarks” the scholar had been making in the media. Most US scholars simply do not\nbother with mainland publishers and look for publication opportunities in Taiwan or\nHong Kong. Several US scholars believe that there are pirated copies of their books or\nat least partially translated copies available within China. At least one scholar found\nthat a search on Baidu yielded half of her most recent book online.\nNot all scholars are willing to sacrifice the opportunity to be published in China.\nOne analyst reported that a senior non-China expert at their think tank permitted\nhis book to be published in China, even though several pages had been mistranslated\nand the editors had actually created some new passages that did not exist anywhere\nin the original text. Even the title and subtitle of the book, as well as the author’s own\nprofessional title, were incorrectly identified.\nPublic Voice\nThe issue of censorship also arises in the context of how think-tank analysts present\ntheir own views publicly, especially when in China. On the whole, think-tank scholars\nshow determination to raise sensitive topics and be forthright in presenting their\nviews. But it is an understandable human instinct to want to be polite and diplomatic\nwhile still conveying one’s own views honestly. As one scholar, who also does a lot of\nSection 5\n72\nconsulting, noted, “Access to China is my livelihood.” At the same time, he argues,\n“I never say anything contrary to my views, but I write in a way that is less shrill.”\nAnother scholar noted, “I don’t self-censor, but there is no need to launch a polemic\nevery day of the week . . . ​polemics get your visa cut off. China’s greatest power is\nthe power of visa control.” A third commented, “I don’t censor the substance, but\nI may modulate what I say.” He argued that he sometimes indulges the sensibilities of\nthe PRC in order to get his deeper point across. As another analyst noted, “I avoid\nsensationalizing. I am willing to be critical, but I try not to make attacks on Xi.”\nAnd different interviewees distinguish between writing and speaking: “I do not\ncompromise on writing, but I am cautious in interviews: I will say the same message\nbut indirectly, not confrontationally.” One analyst said, “I make sure that if I go into\nbattle, I do so thoughtfully, not accidentally.” She tries to be very strategic about the\nmessages that she sends and tries not to weigh in on every small issue or bluntly\ncharge, “You are wrong!” In a similar vein, one other scholar says he often uses an\ninterrogatory, rather than accusatory, approach when raising challenging issues, such\nas human rights.\nThe knowledge that what an analyst says publicly reflects not only on the individual\nbut also on the analyst’s institution also shapes at least one scholar’s thinking: “There\nis a conflict between protecting your institute and speaking truthfully. Whether it is\nover access or money. Sometimes I put the positive first—and then say . . .’but some\npeople say.’ I might not start right off with Xi Jinping—I might be more indirect. In\npublic meetings, there is a tacit understanding that you will not be super critical of\nChina.” Another suggests that it is “very hard not to subconsciously self-censor.” This\nperson indicated that when their institute does projects on counterterrorism in the\nMiddle East or Southeast Asia, they are very careful about discussing China’s restive\nregion of Xinjiang where up to one million Uighurs are presently believed to be in\nreeducation camps. In general, they do not take on projects concerning Taiwan or\nXinjiang.\nInterviewees expressed a deep sensitivity around the issue of Taiwan and how to refer\nto the island and its officials. One analyst observed that in an invitation, his institute\nwould not identify Taiwan’s representative to the United States as an “ambassador,” but\nduring the event, he would indeed orally introduce the official as the “ambassador.” Or\nas another scholar noted, “I am tactful but keep to my original point of view. I don’t\nchange the substance. On Taiwan, in private conversations, I use President Tsai—but I\nalso maintain neutrality in public to ensure that is acceptable to Taiwan and the PRC.”\nTwo analysts stated that they do not self-censor “at all.” They understand the\ntemptation, but they try to write and say in public exactly what they would in private.\nThink Tanks\n73\nPressure from Think-Tank Boards or Outside Influencers\nInteraction between think-tank analysts and the members of their institution’s boards\nof trustees varies significantly. Some engage frequently, socialize, and consult on\nChina-related issues—while others have virtually no contact. Only three interviewees\nreported incidents of attempted interference. In one case, a prominent former board\nmember complained to the head of the think tank about an article that was “too tough”\non China. However, no pressure, besides the obviously intimidating impact of having\na piece of writing singled out by an overseer, was brought to bear on the scholar. In\nanother case, a board member tried to pressure a think-tank president to avoid hosting\nthe Dalai Lama, but failed. A third instance involved the Hong Kong political activist\ndiscussed earlier. The tendency can also work in the other direction. One scholar\nindicated that his board is very involved and has lately become tougher on China in\nrecent years, focusing on “how do we still counter China, yet still engage.”\nChinese Nationals in US Think Tanks\nAmerican think-tank analysts differ in their assessment of the risks and rewards\nfor hosting Chinese scholars as visiting fellows or employing Chinese nationals on\nstaff, with most suggesting that it is better to have them inside the think tanks to\nunderstand how they are thinking and working. One analyst said he “assumed some\nor all would be interrogated” when they returned to China. “RAND,” he said, “should\nbe worried.” One researcher noted that she is “careful to keep Chinese nationals from\nattending sensitive meetings featuring US officials or military officers,” but otherwise\nwelcomes them to events.\nOnly one Washington think tank hosts Chinese scholars on a regular and continuous\nbasis (although Washington-based universities do so more often), including them in\nprogramming and most meetings, even when funded by a Chinese host institution.\nScholars at this institution view them as valuable for gaining insights and for training\npurposes. Another think-tank analyst who has hosted visiting fellows from China\npointed out that two prominent Chinese scholars who spent time at their institution\nwent back and wrote “important papers.” Still, some expressed concern over all the\n“bright young Chinese showing up on Mass [Massachusetts] Ave.” and the potential\nthat they might have for reporting back to Beijing. The scholar noted that think\ntanks want young people to “plow through the Chinese literature,” and this means\nhiring Chinese nationals, Chinese Americans, or Taiwanese because of their language\nabilities. Some analysts expressed concerns that think-tank analysts who are of\nChinese nationality (either nationals or American citizens) may face special pressures\nfrom the imputation that as ethnic Chinese, they are susceptible to Chinese influence\nand control.\nSection 5\n74\nBroader Concerns\nThink-tank analysts voiced a range of concerns around the issue of Chinese\ninfluence–seeking activities in the United States. One is the deliberate effort to manage\nUS perceptions and to frame issues in ways that are favorable to the Chinese\nCommunist Party. As one analyst noted, “This requires pushback, which is tough work.”\nWhile many believed that they could adequately defend themselves against efforts to\ninfluence them, noting as one did that the “the general capacity of US society to push\nback is not bad,” they worried about their colleagues who were not knowledgeable\nChina experts and might therefore be more easily deceived. For example, one scholar\npointed out that with US-China cooperation, the incentive is to come up with shared\nvalues and ideas. He noted that in the case of the Sanya Initiative (the US-China\ndialogue featuring retired military officers from both sides), he has had to “talk them\n(the American participants) off the ledge; they think they are being tough, but they\nare mistaken.” This same analyst sees the American media as complicit in echoing\nChinese perspectives, noting that when Xi Jinping delivered his speech in Davos in\nJanuary 2017, few reporters understood that the Chinese were in the midst of a major\npropaganda campaign to promote globalization 2.0. He also suggests that there is “de\nfacto self-censorship” of entire areas of scholarship: human rights for one. Another\nanalyst noted that outside of the National Endowment for Democracy, she does not see\nmuch foundation interest in normal discourse in this issue either.\nOne scholar worried about growing Chinese control over all areas of US-Chinese\ninteraction: “The Chinese are following people, bugging our hotel rooms. There is\nimbalanced control that serves CCP interests not ours. There is lack of serious training\nby the US side on how to deal with Chinese influence.” The potential for Chinese\nmoney to give China leverage over American think tanks also provoked a degree of\nanxiety. Several scholars expressed concern over funding issues, noting that reliance\non a single funder with an agenda makes scholars vulnerable. In addition, one scholar\nworried that the amount of money China is spending to promote its views, whether\nthrough think-tank cooperation or the Chinese media (such as CGTN paying for its\ninterviews) means that China will ultimately be able to “buy its way in.”\nA number of analysts believed that the involvement of the US government in these\nissues will only make things more contentious. There is concern that Washington will\noverreact. As one analyst noted, there is a type of “binaryism in Washington, in which\nyou must be ‘for or against’ China; you are either friendly to China or producing stuff\nthat says China is evil.” This scholar, along with several others, raised the issue of\nthe rise of anti-China sentiments, such as the “yellow peril” and McCarthyism, and\nexpressed concern about Chinese Americans and anyone who has interests with China\ncoming under attack. One analyst mentioned the Committee of 100, a collection of\nprominent Chinese Americans, as being particularly vulnerable to unfair attack.\nThink Tanks\n75\nAnother analyst noted that we need “a granular view on issues of sharp power.”\nHe pointed in particular to Confucius Institutes, arguing that he would not accept\nConfucius Institute–sponsored research, but was fine with language training, although\nit would be better to get them off campuses. He laughed at the idea that they were\n“effective instruments of Chinese propaganda.” Along these lines, a few individuals\nindicated that they were less concerned about Chinese influence in the social sciences\nand more concerned about reports that Chinese students and postdocs in scientific\nresearch labs bring restricted technologies back to China.\nFinally, there were calls from some analysts for far more reciprocity than currently exists.\nThese analysts felt that the playing field between the two countries was out of balance\nand argued that there should be a much stronger dose of reciprocity and “hardball” in\nUS-China exchanges, arguing that the American side should curtail or cut off contacts\nuntil Chinese institutions were willing to operate at a level of openness similar to that\nfound in their American counterparts.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nAmerican think-tank scholars working on China face an increasingly challenging\nresearch environment. But in this challenge, they are hardly unique. Members of\nthe media and the civil society/NGO world also share similar, even more daunting,\nchallenges. The process for obtaining visas has become more onerous; the quality of\nengagement with Chinese counterparts has declined and become more difficult; and\nopportunities to do field-based research, as well as archival work, have diminished.\nTrack 2 dialogues are viewed with increasing skepticism as to their value by more\nand more US scholars and policy specialists, who find their Chinese colleagues ever\nmore unable and/or unwilling to share their perspectives in an open and meaningful\nmanner. Many think-tank analysts are responding by limiting their Track 2 efforts and\nchanging the way they conduct their research.\nAt the same time, a small but growing group of well-funded Chinese scholars and\nofficials are proactively seeking to shape the American narrative and American views\nof China. They are doing so by supporting and funding joint projects with American\npartners in ways that reflect Chinese government priorities, but they give them the\nopportunity to choose and work with only those American scholars viewed by China\nas sympathetic to China’s goals. To date, these efforts do not appear to have influenced\nthe US debate over China in a significant manner, but it is important to be aware of\nthe money and effort being thrown at the endeavor.\nChinese funding of American think tanks remains limited. C.H. Tung, through his\nChina-US Exchange Foundation, is to date the most common source of financial\nsupport, although most report his funding as “hands-off.” A few Chinese companies\nSection 5\n76\nhave also bankrolled a limited number of American think-tank activities. However,\nAmerican think tanks with centers in China have actively engaged in fund-raising\nfrom mainland Chinese sources. With only a few exceptions, American think-tank\nanalysts do not foresee that Chinese money will become a significant factor in their\nwork at home any time soon, although because of endemic funding shortages at most\nnonprofits, worries about reliance on Chinese money are not unfounded.\nChinese media relentlessly solicit American think-tank scholars’ opinions for\nconsumption within both the United States and China. At least one outlet pays\nparticipants for their time and makes it clear that criticism of China is unwelcome.\nCensorship of written work is common, even expected, so that few interviewees expect\nto have their books published in China. American think-tank analysts appear most\nannoyed when their work is illegally and/or incorrectly published on Chinese websites.\nIn most instances, they seek to have the work taken down from the web.\nAmerican think-tank analysts have a highly developed understanding of Chinese\nefforts to influence their views —whether in the form of heavy-handed criticism\nfrom the Chinese embassy for an article or a proposed meeting with someone like the\nDalai Lama, a Hong Kong dissident, or via more subtle efforts that arise through joint\nprojects funded by Chinese partners. To the last one, all interviewees for this study\nindicated that they refuse to be pressured into changing their practices. Some\nthink-tank scholars acknowledge that they try to be diplomatic in their public discourse\non China—but insist that they do not change their overall message, only their tone\nor choice of wording. Some argue that they save their tough language to deliver the\nmost important messages. But some also admit to acceding to Chinese demands on\nhow to present Taiwanese officials in public settings—such as in the announcements\nof a meeting on the think tank’s website—but then adopting the Taiwanese preference\nduring the meeting itself. The general view—although not shared by all—was that\nseeking to avoid unnecessarily insulting or upsetting the Chinese is the better strategy.\nBut most agreed that the arena of acceptable parlance was shrinking and that pressures\nwere growing.\nAs an antidote, the American think-tank community should understand that its position\nis one with significant leverage. Chinese officials and scholars seek to use think tanks\nas venues for visiting Chinese officials, as legitimating partners for Chinese-supported\nresearch projects that will influence the American narrative, and as important sources\nof information concerning the changing US political landscape. The American scholars\nshould celebrate their principles of independence, use the leverage their institutional\nframeworks provide to resist incursion, and constructively push for greater reciprocity.\nSome specific recommendations include:\nThink Tanks\n77\nPromote Transparency\n• Think tanks should—in partnership with universities—jointly and regularly\nproduce summaries of difficulties in China-related research (access to regions,\nagencies, persons, visas, etc.) and make these available to each other and to\nUS officials. The latter, in turn, should be mindful of the reciprocal nature of\nthink-tank work and how the inability of American scholars to secure meetings\nwith Chinese officials and scholars when Chinese scholars are afforded such\nprivileges is harmful to the stability of the overall relationship.\n• Think tanks should publicly disclose the source of funding for events, publications,\nand other activities. If think-tank leaders elect to solicit funds from Hong Kong\nor mainland Chinese sources, they should be transparent about from where the\nmoney came and how it is being used, to ensure that there is no opportunity for\nthe Chinese funder to harmfully affect the research agenda or outcome.\nPromote Integrity\n• A Code of Conduct should be worked out among US think tanks—perhaps in\nconjunction with American university China studies centers—to establish “do’s and\ndon’ts” in their exchanges with Chinese institutions. Once this is worked out among\nAmerican institutions, then counterparts in other democratic countries should also\nbe approached with an eye toward establishing multilateral Codes of Conduct.\nPromote Reciprocity\n• US think-tank representatives—the presidents and senior China scholars—should\narrange a meeting with the Chinese ambassador to express their collective\nperspectives on these issues and call for changes. Such a meeting could be\nusefully coupled with a jointly signed letter of concern by directors of all major\nUS think tanks.\n• If any member of any think-tank delegation is denied a visa, the delegation\nshould cancel the trip. It sends a profoundly wrong signal to proceed, if China\nis able to control the composition of a delegation. The think tank should also\nconsider a moratorium on Chinese officials visiting or speaking at the think tank\nuntil the visa issues are resolved. The same principle may be applied to Chinese\nthink tanks that refuse to receive American scholars for visits. In such cases,\nUS think tanks should seriously consider not hosting residential stays for Chinese\nvisiting scholars from institutions that do not offer parallel opportunities for\nAmerican scholars in China. (At present, only the Chinese Academy of Social\nSciences and the Shanghai Institute of International Studies permit foreign\nscholars in residence.)\nSection 5\n78\n• The US government should not unilaterally grant Chinese think-tank or university\nscholars ten-year visas, as it has been doing, without exacting across-the-board\nreciprocal treatment for US think-tank and university scholars. At the same time,\nthe US government should also advocate consistently on behalf of US think-tank\nand university scholars who have been barred from visiting China.\nTwo core values cut across all of our concerns: freedom of speech and reciprocity. As a\ndemocratic society, we should tolerate no infringements—overt or covert—on our\nfreedom of speech and freedom of analysis concerning China. A “leveling of the\nplaying field” in terms of upholding the principles and practicalities of reciprocity in\nour exchanges with Chinese counterparts is needed, because it is an essential part of\nmaking the relationship both more equitable and reciprocal and more stable and thus\ndurable.\nNotes\n1 ​These include: the American Enterprise Institute, Asia Society, Carnegie Endowment for International\nPeace, Brookings Institute, Center for American Progress, Center for Strategic and International Studies,\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, International Peace Institute, Institute for China-American Studies, Kissinger\nInstitute on China and the United States, and Stimson Center.\nThink Tanks\nSECTION 6\nMedia\nWhen the Xinhua News Agency leased a massive sign in Times Square in 2011 and then\nagreed to a twenty-year lease for a new US headquarters on the top floor of a Broadway\nskyscraper, it was clear that, as analyst He Qinglian put it, “The Chinese have arrived.” 1\nXinhua’s foray into Manhattan was followed by a website of the People’s Daily, the\nmouthpiece of the Communist Party, which set up shop in the Empire State Building. 2\nAt a time when Western media outlets are challenged by the internet and weakened\nby uncertain business models, China’s rise as a major player in the media landscape\naround the globe has become all the more worthy of attention. The Chinese\ngovernment’s campaign to “grab the right to speak” from Western media outlets and\nindependent Chinese voices, which it accuses of distorting news about China and\nsullying China’s image, has come with a rapid expansion of China’s English-language\nmedia operations, a concerted campaign to control overseas Chinese-language media,\nand ongoing efforts to block attempts by Western media to contend inside China.\nXinhua News Agency journalist Xiong Min summed up the motivation for China’s\nnew campaign in 2010. “The right to speak in the world is not distributed equally,” she\nwrote. “Eighty percent of the information is monopolized by Western media.” 3 It was\ntime, she said, to end that monopoly by means of what China has called the Grand\nExternal Propaganda Campaign ( 大外宣 ).\nSince coming to power, President Xi Jinping has overseen the intensification of this\nexternal propaganda blitz, which was launched in 2007 by former Party general\nsecretary Hu Jintao. As Xi told the November 2014 Foreign Affairs Work Conference\nin Beijing: “We should increase China’s soft power, give a good Chinese narrative,\nand better communicate China’s messages to the world.” 4 This is the task CCP\npropagandists have now undertaken in an increasingly fulsome way. On February 19,\n2016, Xi visited the headquarters of the People’s Daily, Xinhua News Agency, and China\nCentral Television, where he again stressed the importance of external propaganda\nwork. 5 At the August 2018 National Meeting on Ideology and Propaganda, Xi stated:\n“To present good images, we should improve our international communication\ncapability, tell China’s stories well, disseminate China’s voice, show an authentic\n80\nand comprehensive China to the world, and raise the country’s soft power and the\ninfluence of Chinese culture.” 6 External propaganda work has long been an important\nforeign policy instrument for the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Republic\nof China, but under Xi it has become a top priority of China’s party-state.\nState Media\nChina’s Communist Party and government have a long history of trying to influence\ninternational opinion. Over the years, the themes of its external propaganda have\nvaried substantially—usually in parallel with dramatic fluctuations in its own domestic\npolitical campaigns ( 运动 ) and related slogans ( 口号 ), shifts in ideology ( 意识形态 ), meta\npropaganda narratives ( 提法 ), and substantive elements in China’s diplomacy ( 外交 ).\nThe shifts in Beijing’s propaganda lines ( 宣传路线 ) throughout PRC history have been\ndizzyingly consistent, but they are always important to follow as indicators of the\ncountry’s direction.\nDuring the 1950s, Communist China used organizations such as the China News\nService, a successor to the Party’s International News Agency (founded in 1938), to\nappeal to overseas Chinese for support of the new revolution. The Party placed this\nnews service under the State Council’s Office for Overseas Chinese Affairs. Other\npropaganda campaigns targeted allies in the Western world, such as black nationalist\nfigures from the United States like Robert Williams, who were given airtime on\nshortwave broadcasts from Beijing, and a few Western writers and journalists, like\nEdgar Snow, Felix Greene, and William Hinton, who were offered rare, and sometimes\nlucrative, peeks behind the Bamboo Curtain.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, Beijing’s propaganda outreach to\noverseas Chinese slowed, as the Party persecuted those in China with foreign ties. But\nfollowing the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976 and the economic reform program\nled by Deng Xiaoping in the early 1980s, the Party once again directly engaged with\nthe overseas Chinese community as well as with mainstream Western society and\nmedia, appealing to all comers to help China modernize. In 1980, the Party formed\nthe External Propaganda Group ( 对外宣传小组 ) and placed it under the Propaganda\nDepartment of the CCP Central Committee. Zhu Muzhi, the former chief of the\nXinhua News Agency and a vice minister of propaganda, was its first head. In 1991, the\ngroup was transferred to the State Council, where it was still internally referred to as\nthe External Propaganda Group. For foreign consumption, however, it was called the\nState Council Information Office.\nMedia\n81\nFrom 1980, Beijing added to its stable of foreign-facing propaganda publications—such\nas Beijing Review, China Reconstructs, and China Pictorial—by starting or reopening\nmore than twenty periodicals, including the English-language China Daily, the overseas\nedition of the People’s Daily, the overseas edition of Outlook ( 望 ), and the Voice of China\n( 华声报 ). The Party also resumed publishing material for overseas Chinese. During the\nCultural Revolution, the number of magazines targeting overseas Chinese had shrunk\nto ten, whereas by the end of the 1980s, it had surpassed 130. Before 1982, the state-run\nXinhua News Agency had focused almost solely on providing news to domestic Chinese\nclients. In 1983, however, it also began sending news to international clients. The China\nNews Service, which had suspended operations during the Cultural Revolution, also\nresumed work, sending hundreds of stories a day to overseas Chinese-language media.\nToday the CNS employs more than two thousand people worldwide, working out of\nforty-six bureaus. The Party directed its media outlets in their overseas work to support\nsocialism with Chinese characteristics, push the policies of reform and opening up, and\noppose hegemonism, or, in other words, fight against Western ideological control.\nIn the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, China’s propaganda agencies redoubled\ntheir efforts to “grab the right to speak,” or gain “discourse power” ( 话语权 ).\nThe worldwide torch-lighting ceremony touched off free-Tibet rallies and other\nhuman rights protests that angered Chinese authorities and some Chinese as well.\nAn anti-CNN movement began in China, alleging that Western media outlets were\ndistorting “China’s story.” This was the genesis for what has come to be known as the\nGrand Overseas Propaganda Campaign ( 大外宣 ), first promoted by the administration\nof Party Chief Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. The International Herald Leader, a\npublication of the Xinhua News Agency, reported in 2009 that foreign propaganda\nwork had been elevated by the Party to a “systematic, strategic position,” the goal of\nwhich was to “grab back the right to speak, and improve China’s international image.” 7\nReports that had first surfaced in Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post in 2009, that\nChina had earmarked $7 billion for the campaign, were soon repeated by the Chinese\nmedia, most notably in the March 14 edition of Phoenix Weekly. 8\nThe Grand Overseas Propaganda Campaign has been grand, indeed, with Chinese\nsources reporting hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on a multitude of projects\ndesigned to bolster China’s image. The expansion of the Xinhua News Agency is but\none example. From 120, the number of Xinhua bureaus around the world has now\ngrown to more than 200 9 and its client base has expanded to more than 1,450. What is\nmore, it now reports in seven languages and competes directly with all the major wire\nSection 6\n82\nservices of the world. In the United States, Xinhua doubled the number of bureaus,\nadding Chicago, Houston, and San Francisco to its original footprint in Washington,\nDC, New York, and Los Angeles. Xinhua, like other state-owned Chinese media outlets,\nalso began hiring local talent, and in 2009 it began a TV broadcast in English.\nAs part of this vigorous propaganda campaign, the Party has sought to turn China\nCentral Television into a global competitor to CNN. CCTV was already airing in\nAmerica as of 2004, when it cooperated with EchoStar, America’s second-largest\nsatellite TV company, to launch the Chinese “Great Wall Platform” package, including\ntwelve Mandarin channels, two Cantonese channels, one Hokkien channel, and one\nEnglish channel. That same year, Rupert Murdoch’s News Group helped CCTV place\nprogramming on Time Warner and NewsCorp’s US television network. CCTV also\nexpanded its offerings in the United States, growing its bureau in Washington and\nhiring American reporters too. By 2012, CCTV, recently renamed the China Global\nTelevision Network (CGTN), was broadcasting in seven languages. Its programs\nfor American audiences regularly feature personalities from Russia’s state-funded\npropaganda outlet, RT, which was recently required to register as a foreign agent; RT,\nin turn, regularly features CGTN personalities.\nChina Radio International (CRI) was also given a foreign platform. Decades ago, the\nBeijing-based propaganda outlet relied solely on shortwave broadcasts to beam China’s\nmessage to the world, but in the late 2000s it began leasing local stations around the\nglobe and across the United States that it supplied with content made in Beijing. CRI\nhas used a US-based company through which it leases stations. That firm is EDI Media\nInc. ( 鷹龍傳媒有限公司 ), which also owns other media properties that tow Beijing’s line:\nG&E TV ( 環球東方衛視 ), G&E Studio Network ( 環球東方電台 ), and EDI City Newsweek\n( 城市新聞週刊 ). 10 A CRI subsidiary in China, Guoguang Century Media, holds a majority\nstake in G&E Studio. 11 When it comes to reporting on mainland China, the content of\nall of EDI’s outlets mirrors that of China’s state-owned media.\nChina’s state-run media have proved to be nimble in accomplishing Beijing’s goal of\npenetrating US markets. In 2013, the Hong Kong–based Phoenix Satellite TV group,\nwhich has close ties to the Chinese state and broadcasts in China, attempted to\npurchase two major FM stations in Los Angeles that shared the same frequency. One of\nthem, KDAY, covers West L.A., while KDEY stretches into Riverside and San Bernardino\ncounties to the east of the city. Greater Los Angeles is home to more than a half million\nChinese, the second-biggest concentration next to New York City. But none of the\nMedia\n83\nregion’s Chinese-language radio stations are particularly loyal to Beijing, representing\neither independent Chinese voices or those supporting the banned religious sect, Falun\nGong. According to sources close to the deal, Phoenix structured the offer to avoid a\nUS law that limits foreign ownership of US radio stations to 25 percent. In filings with\nthe Federal Communications Commission, Phoenix was listed as owning 20 percent of\nthe US-based investor, RBC, while the remaining 80 percent was owned by an editor\nat Phoenix who is also a US citizen. 12 Under such a setup, no FCC regulations would\nhave been broken. To be extra sure that the deal would go through, however, advisors\nto Phoenix convinced the Hong Kong company to seek approval from the Committee\non Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a Treasury Department bureau\nthat monitors foreign investments in the United States on national security grounds.\nIn a ruling that surprised the potential investors, CFIUS declined to approve the deal,\nreferring it to then-president Obama. Sources close to the deal noted that the fact that a\nPhoenix employee in the United States had pleaded guilty to espionage-related charges\ndid not help Phoenix’s case. 13 RBC pulled out of the deal on September 25, 2013.\nBut the efforts to break into the L.A. radio market did not end there. In the summer\nof 2018, a New York firm, H&H Capital Partners, announced that it was buying a\nMexican radio station, XEWW, that broadcasts throughout Southern California. 14\nSources involved in that deal said that H&H sought to buy a Mexican station in\norder to avoid scrutiny in the United States. H&H is a New York-based firm led by\nseveral individuals who spent years working as reporters for Global Times, a state-run\nnewspaper in China. Filings from H&H to the FCC about the deal suggest that Phoenix\nSatellite TV remains a player in the purchase as the address that H&H gave for its Los\nAngeles–based holding company was the same as Phoenix’s offices in L.A. 15 H&H’s\nattempt to buy XEWW to broadcast into the United States has been challenged at the\nFCC by a Chinese-language radio station linked to Falun Gong. 16\nChina’s main English-language newspaper, China Daily, has also expanded operations\ninto America, starting a North American edition in 2009. In addition, through its\nmarketing arm, China Watch, the paper began distributing English-language content\ndirectly as advertising inserts in the Wall Street Journal, the Des Moines Register, and the\nWashington Post, among other leading US newspapers. Often, it’s hard to tell that China\nWatch’s material is an ad, as was the case highlighted by President Donald Trump with\nan advertising insert in the Sunday Des Moines Register—an insert that the president\nsuggested was aimed at undermining political support both for the president and the\nRepublican party. 17 Rough estimates from newspaper executives indicate that China\nSection 6\n84\nDaily pays $250,000 for each insert in major US dailies. In 2009, the Global Times ( 环球\n时报 ), part of the People’s Daily group, started an English-language newspaper as well.\nChinese investment in the US media market is not limited to the central government.\nChinese provincial media firms also have a footprint in the United States. Sky Link TV\n( 天下衛視 ) is one example. It is fully owned by Guangzhou Media American Co, Ltd.\n( 美國廣視傳媒有限公司 ), which, in turn, is owned by GZ Television Media ( 广州影视传媒有限公司 ), a Chinese state-owned media outlet. Sky Link’s story also illustrates the switch\nfrom Taiwan money to mainland money in the US Chinese-language media world. Sky\nLink was established in 1989 by a Taiwanese corporation. In 2009, it was purchased by\na private Chinese company; three years later, the Chinese state-owned GZ Television\nMedia bought Sky Link TV, a takeover that was hailed by the PRC’s Ministry of\nCommerce as a key “cultural export” in 2014. 18 When Sky Link TV reports on China,\nthe Sino-US relationship, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other important issues concerning\nChina, it follows and quite often repeats verbatim the official line from PRC media. Its\nmajor business partners include CCTV and Xinhua.\nThe Grand Overseas Propaganda Campaign has continued under the regime of General\nSecretary Xi Jinping, who, in his 2014 New Year’s address, called on all media friendly\nto the CCP to “better tell China’s story.” In March 2018, the Party announced plans\nto unite these individual efforts into a mammoth overseas-facing propaganda organ,\nknown as the Voice of China, by merging the foreign operations of China Global\nTelevision Network, China National Radio and China Radio International. 19 (It is not\nclear whether the parallel with the Voice of America was intentional.)\nDespite all of these efforts, President Xi still appears to be unsatisfied with the Party’s\nefforts to “grab the right to speak.” In August 2018, the Chinese government announced\na shake-up in its propaganda organs, reflecting significant concern at the heart of the\nParty that China was not winning its ideological battle with the West. 20\nDiaspora Media\nIn the early 1990s, the state-owned China News Service and the Overseas Chinese Office of\nthe State Council dispatched editorial personnel to the United States to found the Chineselanguage\nTV broadcaster, SinoVision, and the newspaper Qiaobao ( 侨报 ). Shanghai’s\nXinmin Wanbao sent staff to the United States to start up an American edition as\nwell. Chinese officials backed this push as part of an effort to fight back against the\nnegative publicity generated by the Party’s crackdown on protests around Tiananmen\nSquare on June 4, 1989.\nMedia\n85\nThe SinoVision/Qiaobao story is illustrative of Beijing’s push to dominate Chineselanguage\nmedia in the United States. SinoVision, Qiaobao, and the Sino American Times\n( 美洲时报 ) all belong to the Asian Culture and Media Group ( 美國亞洲文化傳媒集團 ).\nSources in these firms say that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council\nof PRC ( 中國國務院僑務辦公室 ) set up the firm in the early 1990s but hid its financial role\nin these companies.\nAll the major executives of these firms appear to have been either appointed directly\nor approved by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. 21 Most of the major executives\nand editors in these businesses served either as editors or reporters for the China News\nService or in the Overseas Chinese Office of the State Council. The group’s flagship\nnewspaper, Qiaobao, is divided into two divisions: the Western US Qiaobao ( 美国西侨胞 )\nand the Eastern United States. Qiaobao ( 美国东侨报 ). The president of the Western division\nis also the chairman of the board of directors of Rhythm Media Group, a corporation\nthat consists of Qiaobao and a few other media outlets, including radio stations in\nSeattle and elsewhere. 22 The chairman worked for the official China News Service ( 中新社 ) for many years as a reporter before coming to the United States to establish the\nWestern US Qiaobao in the 1990s. The China News Service is a branch of the Overseas\nChinese Affairs Office. In 2015, the service described the work of the top executives of\nthe Eastern US Qiaobao’s ( 美东侨报 ) work as part of the PRC’s broader push to strengthen\nits “soft power” and fight back against “Western media hegemony.” 23 Qiaobao is the\nsole major newspaper to use simplified Chinese characters in an effort to appeal to\nimmigrants from mainland China living abroad. Almost all the news stories in Qiaobao\nabout China, the Sino-US relationship, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other important issues\nimportant to China are taken directly from official Chinese media outlets or websites,\nincluding CCTV, Xinhua, and the People’s Daily. Its current editor is I-Der Jeng, and in an\nemail communication with Foreign Policy magazine, he stated that the paper receives no\neditorial direction from Beijing. 24 However, like its parent company, numerous reporters\nand editors on the paper come from China’s state-owned press outlets. 25\nThe group’s main TV outlet is SinoVision. It operates two twenty-four-hour channels\n(one Chinese and one English language), and it is on the program lineups of cable\nsystems covering about thirty million people. SinoVision’s website (http:// www​\n. sinovision​. net) ranks twelfth among all the Chinese websites in the United States. Like\nits sister newspapers, SinoVision was established in 1990 as part of the PRC’s first push\nto establish propaganda outlets in the United States. It is headquartered in New York\nCity, with branches in Boston, Washington, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco,\nand Seattle. According to Wang Aibing ( 王艾冰 ), a former executive of SinoVision,\nSection 6\n86\nstarting in 1990, the State Council’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office gave $800,000\na year to SinoVision, ultimately increasing its subsidy to between $2 million and\n$3 million a year. Wang made this charge in a 2011 letter to the Overseas Chinese\nAffairs Office alleging widespread corruption at the station. 26 Allegations of corruption\nand governmental subsidies have not been corroborated.\nWhat is clear, however, is that, like Qiaobao, SinoVision’s content echoes China’s\nofficial media. The vast majority of its stories about China, Sino-American relations,\nTaiwan, Hong Kong, and other important issues for the PRC government are taken\ndirectly from official Chinese media outlets or websites, including CCTV, Xinhua,\nand the People’s Daily. In an essay, Qiaobao’s Eastern Group president, You Jiang,\ndefended his paper’s support of the PRC’s agenda by saying that it stemmed not\nfrom Beijing’s direction, but from demands from pro-Chinese immigrants in the\nUnited States. 27\nForays by PRC organizations to assert direct control over Chinese-language media in\nthe United States sparked a battle with publications owned by private interests from\nTaiwan and Hong Kong that did not share the PRC’s ideological bent. PRC officials\nopenly acknowledged the political nature of this battle, and in a 2007 interview, Guo\nZhaojin, the president of the state-owned China News Service, noted that if China\ncould gain control of Chinese-language publications in the United States, China would\nbe better able to influence the overseas Chinese community, have a say in American\npolitics, and “protect the national image.” Guo further observed that more than onequarter\nof America’s minorities relied on foreign-language media to obtain their news.\nForeign-language media, said Guo, was a “giant hiding in plain sight.” 28\nBeijing seems to be winning the battle with Chinese-language outlets expressing views\nthat dissent from Beijing’s. Over the course of the last twenty years, a series of onceindependent\nChinese-language media have fallen under Beijing’s control. The Sing Tao\nNewspaper Group was established in Hong Kong in 1938. In the mid-1990s, its original\nowner 29 was forced to divest of interests in the paper, and it was soon taken over by\na pro-PRC businessman, 30 who, starting in 1998, became a member of the Chinese\nPeople’s Political Consultative Conference, which functions as part of the broader\nunited front organization network. Sing Tao’s coverage of China is clearly now aligned\nwith that of state-run media from Beijing. In fact, in May 2001, the year he purchased\nSing Tao, the owner established a joint venture with the Xinhua News Agency to create\nan information-service company known as Xinhua Online.\nMedia\n87\nAnother case in point is the World Journal ( 世界日报 ), for years the premier Chineselanguage\npaper in the United States serving immigrants from Taiwan and only one of\nthe six newspapers owned by the United Daily News (UDN), Taiwan’s most influential\nnewspaper company. The paper once dominated news coverage in Chinatowns across\nAmerica, and it acted as the voice of the Chinese Nationalist Party of Taiwan. Unlike\nPRC-controlled outlets, the World Journal did cover events such as the death of the\njailed Chinese human rights advocate and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiabo. But\nthe Journal’s coverage has shifted in recent years and become more pro-PRC in a\nvariety of areas, such as China’s militarization of the South China Sea and its handling\nof Taiwan and Hong Kong. Sources at the Journal observe that the paper’s owners in\nTaiwan are interested in growing their business in China, which may help explain\nthe paper’s evolving editorial stance. For example, in March 2004, the World Journal\npublished recruitment notices on the front page, announcing its intention to establish\na mainland news group and recruit reporters in China. In a 2015 essay, an executive 31\nat Qiaobao, one of the Journal’s main competitors, noted the Journal’s shifting editorial\nstance. “No longer do they only report negative news about the mainland,” he wrote. 32\nAccording to sources inside the newspaper, Chinese consulates in both New York and\nSan Francisco have pressured World Journal’s local offices not to publish ads related to\nthe religious sect, Falun Gong, which has been outlawed in China. The New York office\nhas already acquiesced in full for the East Coast edition. The West Coast edition now\nonly runs Falun Gong ads in throwaway sections of the paper.\nMing Pao is another formerly independent newspaper that has fallen under Beijing’s\ncontrol. For years, its US edition was popular among Cantonese-speaking immigrants\nin the United States. In January 2007, the Hong Kong Ming Pao Group announced a\n$600 million merger with the two largest Chinese-language media outlets in Malaysia,\nthe Xingzhou Media and Nanyang News. The merger was welcomed in Beijing. Guo\nZhaojin, then president of the China News Service, said the new company would\ndevelop into one of the largest Chinese print media platforms in the world, with more\nthan five newspapers in major cities in North America, Southeast Asia, and Greater\nChina and a daily circulation of more than one million copies.\nChina’s efforts to dominate Chinese-language media coincided with two other\ndevelopments in the 1990s. The Chinese immigrant community boomed in\nthe United States, as hundreds of thousands of mainland Chinese became US\ncitizens, transforming the complexion of a community that had been dominated\nby immigrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Second, Taiwan’s political system\nSection 6\n88\ntransitioned from an authoritarian state to a democracy, leading to new calls from\nthe island and from some of its immigrants in the United States for an independent\nTaiwan. Seeking to capitalize on the ever-larger number of mainlanders in the United\nStates and to battle the nascent Taiwan independence movement, PRC authorities\nestablished organizations and Chinese-language schools to bolster their propaganda\nwork in the United States. The Party’s United Front Work Department founded the\nChina Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification in 1988, and\nwithin a decade it had more than one hundred chapters in sixty countries, including\nmore than a dozen offices in the United States. Chinese officials described Chineselanguage\nmedia, Chinese-language schools, and Chinese-backed organizations as the\n“three treasures” ( 三宝 )of united front work overseas. 33\nChinese-language media. By the mid-1990s, analyst He Qinglian estimated that, of\nthe some one hundred Chinese-language newspapers in the United States, more than\none-third were funded by money from the mainland. 34 Owners of these newspapers,\nseeking subsidies from Beijing, cozied up to PRC authorities with statements such as\n“opposing Taiwan independence and fostering peaceful unification are the glorious\nmissions and historical responsibility of overseas Chinese publications.” 35\nBeijing also moved to take control of online and social media outlets. Wenxuecheng\n( 文学城 , http://wenxuecheng​. com) is the most popular Chinese-language website\nin the United States. Launched in 1997 by a group of students from the University\nof Michigan, the website was sold in 2003 to a Taiwanese-American businessman 36\nwith investments in China. Since being purchased, Wenxuecheng has signed deals\nto run news from Xinhua and the China Daily. 37 There is even an unsubstantiated\nrumor that the purchase of the website was subsidized by $1 million from the CCP\nPropaganda Department.\nDuowei is another online source that was for years an independent Chinese-language\nmedia outlet. Among its many scoops was the prediction of the composition of the\nsixteenth Politburo Standing Committee. But in 2009, Duowei was purchased by a\nHong Kong businessman 38 with substantial business interests in China, including two\ncompanies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The businessman is a founding\nmember of the Tsinghua University Center for US-China Relations and is also fond\nof writing pro-Beijing essays on China’s claims to the South China Sea. Duowei is\nnow headquartered in Beijing. Indeed, since selling Duowei, the online news source’s\nfounder 39 has moved to Mingjing (Mirror Media), a Chinese-language web presence\nMedia\n89\nbased in Canada, where he indicated that last year he received a large investment from\nthe PRC. Since then, Mingjing has significantly modified its editorial stance, switching\nits focus from politics to real estate, immigration, and investing. Part of the reason\nfor this modification appears linked to the disappearance in China of the wife of\none of Mingjing’s reporters after Mingjing aired interviews with a dissident Chinese\nbusinessman. 40\nBeijing has also moved to tighten the ideological consistency for these papers. In 2001,\nthe Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs and the China News Service began a biannual\nconference, the Forum on the Global Chinese Language Media, hosting representatives\nfrom hundreds of Chinese-language periodicals from around the world. Kicking off\nthe first conference in 2001, Guo Zhaojin, the president of the China News Service,\nsaid a key goal of the meeting was to persuade participating Overseas Chinese media\nto use copy from the China News Service instead of reports from competing Chineselanguage\nnews services from Taiwan or from the West. 41 The conference also appears\nto serve as a platform for Beijing to convince critics to modify their tone and to ensure\nthat overseas Chinese-language newspapers follow the Party’s line. Essays released\nduring the conferences praised the censorship of views opposed by the Party and\nstressed the necessity of, in the words of one piece in 2015, “properly telling China’s story”\n(echoing Xi Jinping’s instructions).\nAnd Beijing’s efforts have had some successes. Ranked the number-five Chinese website\nin the United States, http://backchina​. com was once an independent media voice like\nDuowei. But in 2017, its editors attended the ninth forum in China, and since then\nbackchina’s reporting has become far more positive about the PRC.\nIn 2006, the China News Service started holding an Advanced Seminar for the Overseas\nChinese Language Media, for select groups of editors and reporters from overseas;\na seminar in 2006, for example, focused on the correct reading of “socialism with\nChinese characteristics,” while a workshop in 2010 concerned China’s policies in Tibet\nand Xinjiang. At the thirteenth Seminar in 2015, He Yafei, then the assistant director\nof the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, argued that overseas Chinese media needed to\npromote the Belt and Road Initiative and essentially embrace the role of becoming a\nmouthpiece of the CCP promoting China’s national strategy. 42 Beijing also dispatched\nChinese officials overseas to instruct Chinese-language media on how to “correctly”\nreport the news. As the Beijing 2008 Olympics approached, Politburo member and\nhead of China’s Olympic Committee Liu Qi met at the PRC consulate in New York\nSection 6\n90\nwith representatives of the Chinese-language press to lay out China’s demands for their\ncoverage of the event. 43\nIn a further effort to control the overseas Chinese press, the China News Service\nestablished the China News Service Overseas Center, which provides news reports,\neditorials, and layout for overseas Chinese media outlets around the globe. The idea\nbehind the center was that if Beijing were to provide and package content for overseas\nChinese papers, and could convince them to run it, Beijing would then completely\ncontrol the message. 44\nGiven these efforts by Beijing, the space for truly independent Chinese-language media in\nthe United States has shrunk to a few media outlets supported by the adherents of Falun\nGong, the banned religious sect in China, and a small publication and website called\nVision Times. According to the publisher of its New York edition, Peter Wang, Vision Times\nwas formed expressly to address the issue of the shrinking space for independent Chinese\nvoices in the United States. Since then, it has focused on two areas—human rights\nreporting and traditional Chinese culture. Wang noted that while some of the staff of\nthe paper may be Falun Gong adherents, the paper is not a Falun Gong operation. Vision\nTimes began its online presence in 2001, started printing a newspaper in 2005, and claims\na circulation in the United States and Canada of below 60,000. 45\nWeChat as a Source of News in the Diaspora Community\nChina’s social media giant, WeChat, is another major source of news within the\nChinese American community. But it is more than that; for many users in the United\nStates, China, and around the world, WeChat is a digital ecosystem so ubiquitous that it\nconstitutes a lifestyle—a drumbeat that determines the rhythms of the day. In the United\nStates, as in China, WeChat censors news and comments in accordance with rules set by\nChina’s Communist Party. In an analysis of WeChat articles popular in the United States,\nresearcher Zhang Chi found that the most successful pieces skewed significantly to the\nright of the US political spectrum. 46 Zhang noted that the right-wing view on WeChat\ngenerally embraces a social Darwinist, zero-sum conception of racial politics, with\nChinese in America portrayed as beaten down by a system that favors other racial groups\nand illegal immigrants from Latin America. One popular WeChat channel blamed the\nwildfires in 2017 in Northern California on an undocumented immigrant.\nNumerous other channels reported on alleged plans for mass riots and a civil war in the\nUnited States led by the leftist group Antifa. When a Chinese jogger was struck and killed\nMedia\n91\nin a DUI case in a suburb of Los Angeles, a popular WeChat channel reported that the\nmotorist was undocumented and had committed the act to extend his stay in the United\nStates. 47 Zhang noted that another cause of concern was the fact that these WeChat\nchannels helped foster anxiety among first-generation Chinese. As with other Chinese\nimmigrants who rely on traditional Chinese-language media for information, the anti-\nAmerican hothouse created by WeChat’s “news channels” leads to a type of resentful pro-\nChinese nationalism that is ripe for exploitation by the Chinese government.\nWeChat may be no more slanted in its treatment of information than American media\nthat serve domestic political extremes, but there is no precedent for the situation\nWeChat has created: A vast and vital community of Americans gets most of its “news”\nfrom, and does most of its communicating via, a platform known to be censored by a\nforeign government that opposes free speech and has been named by the US National\nSecurity Strategy as the greatest long-term security challenge the nation faces.\nWestern Media\nThe Chinese Communist Party has always recognized the usefulness of the overseas\nmedia (both in local languages and Chinese) as a means to get its message out. Foreignand\nChinese-language media have always served the cause of China’s revolution. For\nexample, in the 1930s, foreign journalist Edgar Snow sang the praises of the Chinese\nCommunist Party and specifically its chairman, Mao Zedong. The Party conducted a\ncampaign in the United States in the 1940s to turn the American public against the\nregime of Chiang Kai-shek and to soften criticism of China’s Communists. Organizations\nsuch as the Institute of Pacific Relations, which provided Americans with in-depth\ncoverage of Asia, were staffed by Communist agents and played an important role in\nfashioning public opinion on America’s relations with China. To be sure, these techniques\nwere not unique to the Chinese Communist Party. The government of Chiang Kai-shek\nand its “China lobby” also used the overseas press to serve its purposes. In the 1950s,\nthe KMT government conducted a campaign against pro-Communist newspapers in the\nUnited States, convincing the US government to shutter several pro-PRC outlets and expel\npro-PRC journalists.\nThe events of 1989 sparked a significant change in China’s foreign propaganda campaign.\nFollowing China’s crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing and other\ncities, China’s image sank to a low not seen by Chinese officials in decades. 48 China\nBooks and Periodicals, which had been operating in the United States since the 1950s,\nclosed its offices on Fifth Avenue in New York City. And the Foreign Languages Press\nSection 6\n92\n(a department of the China International Publishing Group) saw its cooperative\nagreements dwindle.\nIt was then that Chinese officials revived an old tactic that the Communist Party\nhad employed before the revolution—using friendly foreigners and pro-PRC Chinese\nimmigrants to publicize China’s story. Chinese officials called this tactic of localizing\nthe work of foreign propaganda, the “borrowed boat” strategy. 49\nOne such friendly American was a China scholar 50 who was for years associated\nwith Random House. According to Huang Youyi, the chief editor of the Foreign\nLanguages Press posted to the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this\nAmerican argued that for China to improve its image in the United States, it needed to\nwork through American organizations, and so he collaborated with Huang on a book\nseries, “The Culture and Civilization of China,” which the Yale University Press began\npublishing in 1997. The American’s “understanding of the US publishing industry and\nhis friendly attitude towards China became an indispensable condition for the success\nof the cooperation,” Huang wrote. 51 Books from the series are still given to foreign\nguests of the Beijing government.\nIn a period of deep crisis for China’s reputation, Huang’s success in using foreigners\nto publish material beneficial to China’s image became a model for other Chinese\noperations. From the early 1990s, the Chinese Communist Party began to seek\nopportunities to cooperate with Westerners, Western media and publishing companies,\nand overseas Chinese to tell its story.\nLack of Reciprocity\nIt is important to compare Beijing’s efforts to “grab the right to speak” and obtain\n“discourse power” overseas with the efforts, and ability, of Western media organizations\nto access China’s market to a similar degree. For decades, those efforts have faced\nroadblocks placed in their path by the Chinese government. A key roadblock has been\nChina’s ban on Western investment in media except when it involves such things as\nfashion, cars, and lifestyle.\nPrivate media\nUnlike the United States, where Chinese reporters are only restricted from entering\nhigh-security military installations, Western reporters in China are subject to a panoply\nMedia\n93\nof regulations, many of them unwritten. A 2017 report by the Foreign Correspondents’\nClub of China notes that in a survey of 117 foreign journalists based in China,\n40 percent felt reporting conditions had deteriorated compared to 2016, nearly half said\nthey had experienced harassment, interference, and physical violence during their work\nin China, while 15 percent said they encountered difficulties during their visa renewal\nprocess and over 25 percent said they had learned that Chinese contacts had been\ndetained and otherwise hounded by Chinese authorities for speaking with them. 52\nChina has also moved against Western media outlets on many fronts. Both Chineseand\nEnglish-language websites of the New York Times have been blocked in China since\n2012 following a story detailing the wealth of the family of China’s then premier Wen\nJiabao. 53 The English- and Chinese-language sites of the Wall Street Journal and Reuters\nare also blocked, and those belonging to the Financial Times and the Economist are\nblocked on an intermittent basis.\nThe Chinese government has also made it difficult for resident foreign reporters to\nobtain and renew journalist visas. Following the New York Times’ report on Wen’s\nfamily money, China did not approve a new journalist visa for a Times reporter for\nthree years. While the situation has improved somewhat since 2015 for resident\njournalists, the Chinese government still delays visa applications for journalists and\nuses the threat of expulsion from China as a way to pressure Western media outlets\nto soften their coverage of China. This is especially true of freelance journalists or\nindependent documentary filmmakers who are dependent on onetime visas to carry\nout a specific assignment. Here delays and outright refusal to process visas in a timely\nmanner have been common.\nThere is some indication that China’s pressure tactics have paid off. In 2013,\nBloomberg News was preparing to publish a report detailing connections between one\nof China’s richest men and members of the Politburo—the top organ in the Chinese\nCommunist Party, when Bloomberg spiked the story. The outlet’s editor in chief,\nMatthew Winkler, was quoted on a conference call likening the decision to censorship\nof foreign news bureaus that wanted to continue to report in Nazi Germany. 54 Other\nobservers noted that the real reason Bloomberg News killed the story involved the\ncompany’s substantial business interests—especially in “Bloomberg Boxes” selling\naccess to financial information—in China. Indeed, the organization’s founder\nrecently doubled down on China and now even headlines a new forum focusing on\nChina’s global influence with a state-owned Chinese partner. 55 (Interestingly, the\nSection 6\n94\nNovember 2018 gathering in Beijing was cancelled by Beijing and forced to move to\nSingapore.)\nInternational service broadcasters\nAnother roadblock has been China’s efforts to limit the influence of the Mandarin\nservices of the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Starting in the first decade of the\n2000s, the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC, and the leadership of VOA’s Mandarin\nservice began an annual meeting to allow embassy officials to voice their opinions\nabout VOA’s content. PRC embassy officials have also reached out to VOA hosts to\nconvince them to be more supportive of the regime. VOA personalities have hosted\nevents at the embassy. One of VOA’s TV editors even publicly pledged his allegiance\nto China at an embassy event. 56 It is not surprising, then, that some VOA staffers\ninterviewed for this report believe that China’s outreach campaign has succeeded in\npushing the VOA Mandarin service away from programs with direct relevance to China\ntoward programming that seeks instead to highlight American everyday life or teach\nAmerican-style English to Chinese listeners. An example would be a program called\nCultural Odyssey, a VOA TV series that focused on Americana, such as fried chicken,\ndoughnuts, and national parks. For years, Cultural Odyssey ate up one-third of the\nMandarin service’s travel budget. Another program featured English teacher Jessica\nBeinecke, which launched her on a career as an English-teaching TV personality on\nmainland China itself. VOA officials internally praised these programs as both “nonpolitical\nand non-sensitive,” a current senior VOA staff member noted. What’s more,\nVOA officials sought to scale back what were perceived to be sensitive reports. After\nrunning two years of a radio series on aspects of modern Chinese history, including the\nCultural Revolution and other events post-1949, VOA cut the program in 2009 despite\nseveral of those shows garnering well over three million hits each on the web. In 2011,\nthe Broadcasting Board of Governors sought to cut 65 percent of the workforce from\nthe Mandarin service. However, reporters and editors in the service fought back, they\nlobbied Congress, and the cuts were restored. In 2012, a Chinese immigrant, who was\nalso a former Chinese dissident and a specialist on the US political system, became\nthe first female Chinese head of the service. She was later fired over a controversial\ninterview that drew the official ire of the PRC, which threatened repercussions. 57\nSince her dismissal, VOA’s Mandarin service has resumed a pattern of avoiding stories\nthat could be perceived to be too tough on China, according to several staffers. For\nexample, blogs written by dissidents such as Cao Yaxue, who runs the human rights–\nMedia\n95\nrelated http://chinachange​. org site, have been removed from the VOA website. Several\nprominent Chinese commentators are no longer on VOA’s lineup of analysts. Many\nstaffers now describe VOA’s content as neither pro- nor anti-China. The emphasis, the\nstaffers observed, is on travel, culture and language, programming the likes of which\nChinese viewers can access equally well on CGTN or China’s internet. By contrast, the\ncontent of Radio Free Asia remains far more hard-hitting than its counterpart, VOA.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nChina has used America’s openness to convey its message both to English- and\nChinese-speaking residents of the United States. US rules allow foreign media\ncompanies, even ones run by foreign governments, to broadcast freely via American\ncable and satellite networks. Unlike in China, the United States government does\nnot block any Chinese websites, many of which are funded by the PRC government.\nWhile the Communications Act of 1934 theoretically only allows foreigners to own\n20 to 25 percent of terrestrial wireless radio and TV stations, the law has been loosened\nconsiderably over the past decade, and it does not even apply to cable channels or leasing\narrangements wherein a foreign entity, including one owned by a foreign government,\ncan pay an American licensee for airtime. Chinese media outlets have used all such\nstrategies to publicize the views of the Beijing government. 58 Perhaps more worrisome,\nChina has also been successful in funding or convincing pro-PRC businessmen to fund\npro-PRC media outlets in the United States that nominally appear independent so that\nthe three most important traditionally independent Chinese-language newspapers now\nincreasingly side with Beijing.\nBy contrast, the Chinese government severely limits the scope of US and other Western\nmedia outlets in China and has banned Western media investment in China, except in\nvery limited innocuous areas, such as in fashion, automobiles, investing, health, and\nlifestyle. The idea that a Western TV news network could lease a Chinese station and\nbroadcast news to China around the clock—as their Chinese counterparts do here in\nthe United States—is not even thinkable. Equally, there is no chance that a Western\nmedia company would be allowed to invest in a Chinese publication that reported\nmainstream news.\nBoth the expansion of Chinese state-owned English-language media in the United\nStates and Beijing’s increasing control of Chinese-language media outlets in the United\nStates are very problematic for an open dialogue. For one, these media are under the\nSection 6\n96\ncontrol of a foreign government, not simply a foreign individual or firm. Second,\nthe diminishing space within America’s Chinese-language media for independent\nvoices runs counter to the goals of a liberal society seeking a diversity of perspectives.\nFurthermore, the PRC’s control of Chinese-language media outlets in America and\nits increasingly strong position among English-language outlets provides China\nwith the potential of mobilizing Chinese Americans and Americans alike to espouse\npolicies counter to US interest. The constant drumbeat of anti-American reporting\nin pro-Beijing media outlets headquartered in the United States creates an unhealthy\nenvironment.\nPromoting Transparency\nA major challenge is the fact that China has worked successfully to mask its influence\noperations with respect to US media. On paper, for example, the Asian Culture and\nMedia Group controls the pro-China SinoVision and Qiaobao as a private company.\nThe reality is that it is staffed by people who served the state-run China News Service\nand were, sources insist, dispatched to the United States by the Chinese government\nto establish propaganda operations in the United States. Given its nominal status\nas a private company, taking action to shut down its operations would be fraught\nwith even more legal and ethical challenges than those involving media corporations\ndirectly owned by the PRC. The same holds true for publications and websites that\nwere once independent but have now increasingly fallen under the sway of the PRC. If\nUS law protects the rights of publishers of newspapers or websites to put their personal\npolitical imprint on their enterprises, how can the US government move to deny it to\nthose of a pro-PRC bent?\nAt a minimum, what US authorities can do is work to establish the real ownership\nstructure of Chinese (and other foreign) companies purchasing US-based media. Any\nforeign-owned or foreign-controlled media (including print media), and particularly\nthose that advance a foreign government line, should be required to register under the\nForeign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\nBeyond FARA, there should also be a review to see whether these organizations and\ntheir employees should also register under existing lobbying laws as foreign agents.\nIn addition, there is an argument to be made to ensure that employees of these\norganizations should be given a disclosure package making them aware that they are\nworking for a foreign agent institution.\nMedia\n97\nPromoting Integrity\nFiguring out how to properly counter the PRC’s influence operations in both\nEnglish- and Chinese-language media presents enormous challenges in a free society.\nThe United States could consider restrictions on state-controlled media outlets,\nwhich would not include publicly funded broadcasters, such as the BBC, which\nmaintain editorial independence. Failing that, the recent requirement that state-run\npublications, TV and radio broadcasters, and potentially their employees, register as\nagents of a foreign government is a partial solution. 59 And in late 2017, Russia’s RT\nregistered as a foreign agent 60 while in September 2018, the US Justice Department\nreportedly also ordered CGTN and Xinhua to register as agents of a foreign power. 61\nWhen it comes to independent Chinese-language media, the US government should\nconsider doing more to help such independent outlets survive, including using\ngrants via the Fulbright program or other vehicles, such as the State Department\nInternational Visitors or Speakers’ Bureau. Domestically, the US government could also\nconsider aiding the operations of independent Chinese-language media, including\nmanufacturing credits for printing press operations, and nonprofit tax designations\nto allow journalism business models to survive the current transitional crisis. Private\ncharitable foundations can also make a difference in helping independent Chineselanguage\nmedia remain editorially independent and financially viable.\nPromoting Reciprocity\nThe time has come for the US government to demand reciprocity for American\njournalists attempting to do their professional work in China. To the extent that they\nare prevented from doing so as a result of visa denials and restrictions of access, the US\nState Department should respond in kind by restricting visas and access for Chinese\njournalists in the United States. To the extent that American journalists experience\nharassment and physical violence, this should also have a bearing on the granting of\nvisas and access to Chinese journalists.\nNOTES\n1 ​He Qinglian has written the most detailed study of the Chinese-language media landscape in the United\nStates.

With its reports on the famine during the Great Leap Forward, the suppression of the Falun Gong\nreligious sect of 2001, and the June 4th crackdown on pro-democracy protesters of 1989, the program\nbecame popular among viewers in China. However, Gong’s time at the head of the service ended in 2017,\nafter she and VOA management had a falling-out over an interview VOA was doing with Chinese billionaire\ndissident Guo Wengui. Gong had arranged the interview to air on VOA’s TV channel on April 19, 2017. VOA\nadvertised the interview, which was going to be live, on its website beforehand. Prior to the interview,\nhowever, the Chinese government warned VOA’s correspondent in Beijing of serious repercussions should\nthe interview air. Chinese embassy officials also contacted VOA in Washington threatening retribution.\nDespite concern from VOA’s management, Gong went ahead with the interview. While circumstances\nMedia\n101\nsurrounding what happened next are murky, VOA’s management ended up pulling the plug on the interview\nin the middle of a live broadcast. Gong and several other employees were suspended and subsequently\nfired for insubordination. Gong is contesting her dismissal through the Broadcasting Board of Governors,\nwhile VOA management denies that it was responding to Chinese pressure to stop the interview or\nfire Gong.\nChinese authorities have used both a charm offensive and tougher tactics to deal with both VOA and\nRadio Free Asia. China’s retaliation goes far beyond trying to block their transmissions into China. Security\nofficials from the PRC government have been involved in a campaign of intimidation against some VOA\nand RFA staffers and their family members. In early 2018, relatives of some Uighur reporters on Radio Free\nAsia were detained by Chinese authorities in Xinjiang province. VOA’s Mandarin service has approximately\none hundred employees. Although many of them write under pseudonyms, it appears that Chinese state\nsecurity knows who they are. Five Chinese staff members interviewed for this report said that while visiting\nfamily in China they had been contacted by representatives from state security who have impressed upon\nthem the necessity to change how they have reported on China. In one case, a young woman who is in\nthe United States on a journalist visa and who does not yet have American citizenship was threatened\nwith imprisonment during a visit last year to China if she did not reveal the names of her editors. She did\nso. In some cases, those affected have contacted the security department at the Broadcasting Board of\nGovernors. In other cases, worried about potential Chinese retribution against family members still in\nChina, they have not.\n58 ​Interview with FCC official.\n59 ​O’Keeffe, Kate and Aruna Viswanatha. “Justice Department Has Ordered Key Chinese State Media\nFirms to Register as Foreign Agents.” Wall Street Journal.

Foreign leverage over American\ncorporations can thus advance important strategic interests of the country in question.\nIn addition, as Chinese corporations go abroad, they, too, bring with them the potential\nof being leveraged by the Chinese government to advance China’s interests. This section\nexamines improper influence in the US corporate sector, as well as the potential for future\ninfluence because of significant economic exposure to China.\nThe US-China economic relationship is large and multifaceted. Trade statistics illustrate just\none aspect of this tangled web: In 2017, the United States exported goods worth $130 billion\nto China, while importing goods worth $505 billion. 1 With trade also comes extensive\nforeign investment, as well as significant levels of employment of each country’s citizens.\nSince 2000, the cumulative value of Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United\nStates has exceeded $140 billion, with US investment in China being more than double\nthat amount. 2 In the United States, there is more Chinese investment in the real estate\nsector than any other area. But until recently more deals are being done in the information\ntechnology sector, which has attracted the growing attention of the Committee on Foreign\nInvestment in the United States (CFIUS).\nChina is increasingly willing to engage in aggressive forms of economic statecraft. 3\nThis includes not just denial of access to, or harassment in, China’s own market, but\nalso targeting of other countries’ domestic economies and companies. These actions are\nsometimes state-led; at other times China’s state-run media will encourage “consumer-led”\nboycotts (as in the cases of Japan, Norway, and South Korea, among others). 4 Chinese\ncorporations abroad are all well aware of Chinese official policy and understand the value\nof acting in support of their country’s foreign or industrial policy objectives. China’s\ngrowing commercial presence in other countries’ economies strengthens its ability to\npotentially influence their politics.\nThis section examines corporate sector influence through three lenses: (1) the use of\nbusiness-related United Front organizations in the United States; (2) Chinese companies\noperating in America; and (3) Chinese pressuring and manipulation of American\ncompanies as vectors of influence. All three approaches are cause for concern, yet\nthe pressuring manipulation of American corporations has generally attracted less\nattention.\n104\nThis section intends to highlight three main developments. First, China is supporting\nan increasing number of local chambers of commerce in the United States with direct\nties to CCP officials. Second, as Chinese companies have become more global, they\nhave also grown more sophisticated in their efforts to socialize and localize\nthemselves in their new American communities, but also acquire political influence\nin the United States. Finally, China increased its efforts to pressure, co-opt and sometimes\neven coerce foreign corporations with the aim of influencing politics in their home\ncountries.\nThe Use of Business-Related United Front Organizations\nConsistent with the practice of other nations, major Chinese firms operating in America\nare represented by a chamber of commerce network. Analysis detailed below suggests\nthat China also operates an extensive list of United Front organizations purporting to\nbe regional chambers of commerce. China’s public-facing chamber in the United States\nis known as the China General Chamber of Commerce (CGCC), which was founded in\n2005. It is headquartered in New York with five regional operations in Chicago, Houston,\nLos Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. Its website states that it has 1,500 member\ncompanies, both Chinese and non-Chinese. The organization’s chair is Bank of China USA\npresident and CEO Xu Chen. Its website lists more than sixty individuals, many from stateowned\ncompanies, in governance roles; its website lists a staff of nine.\nConsistent with business organizations of other countries, the CGCC engages in a mix\nof political engagement with its host and home countries (e.g., testifying at the US\nInternational Trade Commission 5 and hosting officials from the Chinese Ministry of\nCommerce 6 ); informational activities for its members (e.g., a lunch-and-learn on labor\nand safety issues in the United States); 7 and promotional activities (e.g., dinner galas and\ncharity events). The CGCC is actively engaged with senior American political and business\nleaders. In July 2017, it hosted a welcome luncheon at the National Governors Association\nmeeting in Rhode Island, at which the governors of Maryland, Kentucky, Alaska, Arizona,\nLouisiana, and Rhode Island attended. In September 2017, the group organized the visit of\nthe governors of Alaska and Missouri to China. 8\nInconsistent with the practice of other countries, China also oversees an extensive network\nof local chambers of commerce. This raises a question of their possible ties to the Chinese\nparty-state, and whether these chambers may be misrepresenting themselves as local\nconcerns when they are instead activated by, or in liaison with, the Chinese government.\nResearch for this project has identified thirty-one business-focused organizations operating\nin the United States that are explicitly associated with or whose profiles and activities\nare highly suggestive of involvement with United Front work. 9 Most of these groups are\nconcentrated in Greater Los Angeles and New York City, two principal communities of the\nChinese diaspora. They are typically organized by hometown province of origin. This count\nCorporations\n105\ndoes not include many other professional diaspora groups that may be used to facilitate\nChina’s influence operations.\nSuch Chinese groups have increased their activity in the United States since 2015, 10 and\nmany of these groups have had interactions with the United Front Work Department and\nother Chinese officials both in the United States and in China, contacts that are distinctly\ndifferent from invitations to embassy or consular diplomats and bear further scrutiny. 11\nAt least eleven of the chambers identified in this\nanalysis were established in 2016 or later, consistent\nwith heightened activity observed in other sectors\nof society dedicated to projecting China’s soft power\nand influence abroad. (Tellingly, China’s spending\non diplomacy has doubled to $9.5b per year under\nXi Jinping.) 12 The US-Zhejiang General Chamber of\nCommerce’s WeChat description explicitly references\na 2015 provincial directive on strengthening the\nprovince’s overseas Chinese connections (see\nscreenshot). Many of these groups maintain their\nown presence, via a website or, increasingly, the\nWeChat social media platform. In one instance, our\nresearcher’s antivirus software blocked an intrusion\nattempt while researching the US-Fujian Chamber of\nCommerce.\nChinese Companies Operating in America as a Vector of Influence\nMore than 3,200 Chinese-owned companies operate in the United States, employing\n140,000 Americans. 13 Chinese establishments operate in all but ten congressional districts. 14\nAs Chinese companies’ presence in the US economy grows, given the United Front’s\npenchant for using civil society organizations for its purposes, they bring with them several\npotential risks. First, their potential to be used by Beijing may result in activities that are\ncontrary to US interests, as evidenced by intense scrutiny of their investment activities by\nCFIUS and reported warnings by counterintelligence officials. Second, growing access to the\nUS political system, even if currently used to advance legitimate economic interests, creates\nopenings for future exploitation by the Chinese government. Third, Chinese companies\nmay effectively “export” corrupt or unethical business practices.\nActivities Contrary to US Interests\nThe technology sector has been the most consistent and prominent source of concern.\nIn 2012, the Intelligence Committee of the US House of Representatives declared\nChinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE a national security threat given the\nfirms’ alleged ties to the Chinese military and the potential for their technology to\nSection 7\n106\nbe exploited for espionage or cyberattacks. 15 Both companies were key providers of\ntechnology at the African Union headquarters building, where investigators have\nfound widespread electronic infiltration traceable to China, whose state-owned firms\nconstructed the building. 16 Both Huawei and ZTE have also been accused of bribery\nabroad to win contracts. 17\nFor years, the federal government has actively discouraged American companies, local\ngovernments, and allied countries from partnering with Huawei. Nonetheless, the\ncompany’s global presence has continued to grow, and it is playing an important role in\nsetting standards for 5G wireless technology. 18 In April 2018, the United States announced\nsanctions against ZTE for violating restrictions on sales to Iran and North Korea, barring\nAmerican companies from transacting with the company. This would have effectively put\nZTE out of business because of its dependence on American inputs, but shortly thereafter,\nand against the objections of many in Congress, the Trump administration agreed to a\nsettlement that would allow the firm to stay in business.\nThere are other instances of companies being used to advance objectives contrary to the\nUS interest. For example, front companies have been used to aid in the illegal export of\nsensitive technologies to China. In another instance, Newsweek in 2016 reported that\nthe United States was investigating the acquisition by the Chinese company Fosun of\na US insurer that has sold legal liability insurance to senior American intelligence\nofficials. 19\nGrowing Access to the US Political System\nAlthough federal campaign contributions by foreign nationals or companies are illegal in\nUS federal elections, there are alternative avenues for foreign corporate interests to influence\nthe US political system, as the Australians have learned. These include lobbying, indirect\ncampaign contributions via US subsidiaries, and the hiring of former senior government\nofficials. All these approaches, while currently legal, are discussed below to demonstrate the\nfull spectrum of activities Chinese entities are involved with and to highlight where they\nmay raise questions of impropriety.\nLobbying The most direct and legal route to the American political system is lobbying.\nFor example, within one day of President Trump tweeting his openness to a settlement\nwith ZTE Corporation that would keep it from going out of business, the company signed\na contract with lobbying firm, Mercury Public Affairs. The lead on the ZTE account was\nBryan Lanza, a former Trump campaign official. 20 Also in 2018, the former senior advisor\nto Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross was hired as chief of International Corporate\nAffairs for another Chinese firm, HNA. Both instances underscore the need for updated\nrevolving-door policies, particularly with respect to foreign corporations that are subject to\nsignificant state control. 21\nCorporations\n107\nAll told, major Chinese companies publicly acknowledge spending $3.8 million on\nfederal lobbying in 2017 and $20.2 million in total since 2000, 22 modest amounts by\nglobal standards. The Chinese e-commerce behemoth, Alibaba, was the largest source of\nexpenditures in 2017, accounting for $2 million, followed by technology company ZTE\n($510k), Sinopec ($384k), 23 and the Wanda America Group ($300k), affiliated with Dalian\nWanda. 24 More difficult to track is Chinese corporate participation in American trade\nassociations. In early 2018, two Chinese companies have joined two major lobbying groups\nnoted for their political heft. 25\nIndirect Donations A key exception to the ban on foreign federal campaign contributions\nis permitted through activity conducted via a US subsidiary of a foreign company.\nThe Federal Election Commission has written that “where permitted by state law, a US\nsubsidiary of a foreign national corporation may donate funds for state and local elections\nif (1) the donations derive entirely from funds generated by the subsidiaries’ US operations,\nand (2) all decisions concerning the donations, except those setting overall budget amounts,\nare made by individuals who are US citizens or permanent residents.”\nThis exception inherently creates the potential for exploitation, particularly given the\nintrinsic difficulties of monitoring and enforcement. For example, the Intercept has reported\nthat American Pacific International Capital (APIC), an American subsidiary of a corporation\nowned by a Chinese citizen, contributed $1.3 million to the Super PAC of presidential\ncandidate Jeb Bush on the advice of a prominent Republican campaign finance lawyer. 26\n(Neil Bush, the brother of George W. and Jeb Bush, and former ambassador Gary Locke have\nserved as advisors of American Pacific International.) 27\nEmployees of Chinese enterprises, who in making the donations are presumably American\ncitizens, are also active donors. A review of campaign donation data finds that several\nindividuals cited as members of the China General Chamber of Commerce or employed\nby member firms have made recent campaign contributions. For example, two individuals\nassociated with HNA Group, including Tan Xiandong, the group’s president, in 2017\ndonated $2,500 each to the congressional campaign of Greg Pence, the brother of the vice\npresident. 28\nIn May 2018, China-based companies reportedly invited Chinese to attend several\nRepublican Party fund-raising dinners at which President Trump would appear. The\ninvitations prominently featured the Republican Party’s logo along with that of\nChina Construction Bank, making it appear as if there was some formal connection. 29\nThe Republican Party and China Construction Bank both denied awareness of the\nsolicitations in their name. Foreigners may attend fund-raisers so long as they do not pay\ntheir own entry, another instance in which the fungibility of money makes it easy to\nskirt this rule.\nSection 7\n108\nHiring of Former Senior Government Officials In other countries (such as Australia, UK,\nFrance, and Germany), former senior government officials routinely take positions with\nChinese companies. This pattern appears less pronounced in the United States. A prominent\nexception is the law firm Dentons, which merged with the Chinese law firm Dacheng in\n2015 30 and employs numerous former government officials, including former ambassadors,\nmembers of Congress, mayors, and generals. 31\nEarlier in 2018, Bloomberg News reported on the Imperial Pacific casino, a Chinese-owned\ncompany operating in the American territory of Saipan. Its large transaction volumes have\nraised concerns about potential money laundering. It has also made millions of payments to\nfamily members of the territory’s governor and, at one time, counted the former governors\nof three states as well as the former directors of the CIA and FBI as members of its board or\nadvisors. 32\nState and Local Politics Many states do not have prohibitions against foreign contributions\nin local races. 33 One of the most notable examples of an individual contributor comes\nfrom Virginia, where in 2013 and 2014, Wang Wenliang, a Chinese industrialist who was\nexpelled from China’s national legislature in 2016, contributed $120,000 to Governor Terry\nMcAuliffe’s campaign. 34\nChinese firms are also involved in lobbying at the state and local level, another means\nof acquiring legitimate influence. While the quality of data reporting and aggregation\nfor local and state-level lobbying is not always as robust as that at the federal level, this\nproject was able to identify more than $1 million in state-level lobbying expenses over the\npast decade by Chinese firms. BYD Motors, which produces buses for public transit in the\nUnited States, Huawei, and Wanda America Group were among the biggest spenders on\nlobbying.\nA 2017 complaint with the Federal Election Commission against the California subsidiary\nof Dalian Wanda is illustrative of the potential for exploitation granted by the USsubsidiary\nexception. The FEC found that Lakeshore, a Chicago real estate company\nwhose principals are US citizens, was the source of the money that funded a local ballot\ninitiative in California that would have blocked a Wanda competitor from expanding.\nWanda acknowledged that the money for the measure had come from Lakeshore, with\nwhich Wanda does business, in the form of a $1.2 million loan. In its conclusion, the\nFEC did not rule on whether foreign restrictions applied to ballot measure activity.\nFurther, it argued that even if those restrictions did apply, because “none of the funds\nat issue appear to originate with a foreign national” (i.e., they came from Lakeshore);\nthat because the Wanda deputy manager who was listed as the principal officer of the\nBallot Measure Committee was an American citizen (the general manager is a Chinese\nnational); and that the funds originated in and would be paid back by revenues generated\nCorporations\n109\nin the United States, the activity was not in violation of laws against foreign campaign\nactivity. 35\n“Exporting” Corrupt or Unethical Business Practices\nChina scores poorly on international indices of corruption. 36 As Chinese companies\nexpand abroad, it is possible that they could have a deleterious effect simply by exporting\nsuspect business practices. An industry of particular importance is banking. The “big four”\nChinese banks all operate in the United States, where their assets have increased sevenfold\nbetween 2010 and 2016 to $126.5 billion. 37 They are often extensively involved in real estate\ntransactions of Chinese firms operating in the United States. In 2015, 2016, and 2018, China\nConstruction Bank, 38 the Agricultural Bank of China, 39 and Industrial & Commercial Bank\nof China 40 were respectively subject to enforcement action by the Federal Reserve for not\ndoing enough to fight money laundering.\nChinese corporations in the United States can also hinder the rule of law in other ways.\nWhen responding to lawsuits in US courts, Chinese state-owned enterprises have claimed\nexemption due to sovereign immunity; in other instances, Chinese firms with an American\nlegal presence have refused to comply with US investigations by claiming that cooperation\nwould violate Chinese law. 41 These actions inhibit the ability of the US government to\nregulate commerce and put American competitors at a disadvantage within their own\ncountry.\nChinese Manipulation of American Companies as a Vector of Influence 42\nAmerican companies play a significant role in American foreign and domestic politics and\ntheir leaders regularly are selected to take positions of leadership in government. As a result,\ncorporate America’s traditional role in favor of engagement with China, given the country’s\nmarket potential, has had significant weight in American policy toward the country. 43\nChina, for its part, welcomed foreign companies’ investment as part of its policy of reform\nand opening up in the hope of spurring economic development.\nChina’s relationship with corporate America has become increasingly fraught. In this report\nand elsewhere, China’s state-directed efforts to facilitate the theft of intellectual property,\nthe lifeblood of developed economies, are well documented. China’s forced transfer of\ntechnology by foreign firms, as a condition of operating in China, is one of the main\ncomplaints of both the Trump administration and the European Union.\nBut China’s ability to pressure US companies also encompasses three other more elusive\ndimensions. First, recognizing the importance of American companies in American\npolitics, China has frequently cultivated, even leveraged, American executives to\nlobby against policies it opposes. Where cultivation fails, it has threatened or exercised\nSection 7\n110\neconomic retaliation. For example, in June 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that Xi\nwarned a group of global CEOs that China would retaliate with “qualitative measures”\ntargeted at their companies, if the United States did not back off from the tariff war. 44\nSecond, China is seeking to pressure American companies into legitimizing its geopolitical\nclaims and interests, for example by demanding that Western firms overtly acknowledge\nthat Taiwan is an irreversible part of China. Third, China has wooed American companies\nwith both sticks and carrots into serving its strategic interests abroad, most notably via its\ninteractions with Hollywood.\nChina’s source of leverage over American companies comes from its large domestic market\nand its key role in international supply chains; by contrast, China holds little direct\nownership in American companies. American affiliates (i.e., those at least half-owned by\nAmerican multinational companies) employ 1.7 million Chinese workers and are indirectly\nresponsible for the employment of millions more. 45 More than fifty American companies\nreport that they generate at least 20 percent of their revenues from China. 46 Naturally,\nmany companies (and industry associations) with large stakes in China lobby the American\ngovernment on issues related to China, often seeking to exert a moderating influence on US\npolicy. This is not in itself evidence of improper influence, but it merits scrutiny and should\nbe weighed in the context of other evidence in this section. 47\nSeeking to Influence American Politics via Corporate Interests\nChina does, in fact, exert influence on how at least some American companies and\ncorporate executives interact with the American government. This influence generally\ntakes two forms. In the first, China relies on American corporations to retard efforts by the\nAmerican government to investigate and sanction Chinese behavior deemed harmful to\nnational economic or strategic interests. For example, some American corporations have\nexpressed reservations about cooperating with US trade investigations for fear of retaliation\nby China.\nChinese officials also regularly convene senior American executives at special meetings\nwith government officials or major conferences. During these engagements, Western\nCEOs’ positive comments on the country receive wide play in the foreign and domestic\nmedia, one of many ways in which the Party continues to seek the appearance of outside\nlegitimization for domestic purposes. In addition, China uses these meetings to attempt to\ncoerce American executives to take China’s side in disputes with the US government. As\nthe risk of a trade war mounted in spring 2018, Chinese officials explicitly warned gathered\nexecutives to lobby the US government to back down or risk disruption to their business\nin China. 48 The US government does not strategically convene foreign business leaders, let\nalone instruct them to use their influence to shape policy favorable to the United States in\ntheir home countries.\nCorporations\n111\nAdvancing Strategic Interests Abroad: A Case Study of Hollywood\nAs its market power mounts, China is increasingly able to leverage foreign corporations\nnot just to influence their home governments, but also to advance China’s broader\nstrategic interests around the world. The most visible manifestation of this strategy is\nthe Party-state’s effort to influence Hollywood in a bid to advance China’s global soft\npower agenda.\nAmerican popular culture has enjoyed worldwide influence for decades and is a key element of\nthe country’s soft power. However, by the end of the Hu Jintao era, China’s leaders had begun\ncalling for their country, too, to become a soft power leader, a theme Xi Jinping has continued\nto stress. The subsequent surge in Chinese spending on entertainment, or its “cultural\nindustries,” 49 as it calls this sector, amid flat revenues in the United States, has made China’s\nmarket a compelling one for Hollywood, despite continued quotas limiting the number\nforeign films that can be shown in China. In 2017, the Chinese box office reached $7.9 billion\non growth of 21 percent, whereas the US market grew just 2 percent to $11.1 billion. 50 (Foreign\nfilms account for roughly half of China’s total, most of which is attributable to Hollywood.)\nIn the 2010s, in addition to investing in its domestic film industry and maintaining\na restrictive import regime, the Chinese government encouraged the country’s media\ncompanies to enter into alliances or attempt to acquire outright American entertainment\ncompanies. Collectively, these strategies have raised concerns about self-censorship, the\nco-opting of the American film industry to advance Chinese narratives, and ultimately, the\nrisk that the industry will lose its independence.\nHollywood, represented by the Motion Picture Association of America, has long cultivated\nclose ties to the American government, which it has used to open access to China. For\nexample, media scholar Aynne Kokas notes that in 2012, Vice President Joe Biden met with\nthen Chinese vice president Xi Jinping to discuss China’s quota on foreign films. 51 During\nXi’s visit, Biden also helped broker an agreement between DreamWorks and a group of\nChinese investors. Ultimately, in response to these efforts and WTO action, China increased\nits annual quota of imported films from twenty to thirty-four.\nFilm studios can attempt to circumvent the import quota by coproducing films with Chinese\npartners. This can invite censorship directly into the production process, potentially\naffecting what global audiences see, as opposed to censorship that affects only what the\nChinese market sees. 52 Examples abound of studios that have cast Chinese actors, developed\nand/or cut scenes specific to the Chinese market, or preemptively eliminated potentially\nobjectionable references to China from scripts even when source material has called for it.\nAware of the Chinese market’s growing centrality to the film industry, major studios are\nalso reluctant to produce any film that would upset China, even if that specific film was\nSection 7\n112\nnot intended for the China market, for fear that all films by the studio would be blocked.\nIndeed, the last spate of movies made for general circulation that addressed topics that the\nChinese government deemed sensitive were released in 1997 and included such productions\nas Red Corner, Seven Years in Tibet, and Kundun. Several prominent American entertainers\nhave been subject to bans by China, most often for their association with the Dalai Lama.\nIn an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, actor Richard Gere, an outspoken advocate of\nTibetan culture, stated, “There are definitely movies that I can’t be in because the Chinese\nwill say, ‘Not with him.’ ” 53\nBeyond self-censorship, American studios and creative personnel are at risk of being actively\nco-opted in advancing Chinese soft power. Chinese political and entertainment leaders are\nconscious that American entertainment companies have played an outsize role in defining\nChina, from Mulan to Kung Fu Panda. By the time the third edition in the Panda franchise\nhad been released, however, it was being coproduced with a Chinese partner. The list of\nfilms portraying China in a positive light grow each year, such as the space films Gravity\nand The Martian, a movie backed by Chinese money in which the American protagonists\nare saved by the Chinese. Ironically, in Gravity, a central plot twist involves the shooting\ndown of a satellite by the Russians. In fact, the only nation to have shot down a satellite in\nreal life is China. These positive portrayals, of course, are not inherently objectionable—\nand they may, indeed, provide a constructive countervailing force in an otherwise\ndeteriorating relationship. The issue is: How do these portrayals come to be: In other\nwords, has independent artistic vision been manipulated by political pressures to\nmaintain commercial standing?\nThe rush of Chinese investment into the American film industry has raised legitimate\nconcerns about the industry’s outright loss of independence. In 2012, Dalian Wanda\nacquired the AMC cinema chain, followed in 2016 by the acquisition of the Legendary\nEntertainment studio. Before encountering political trouble at home, Wanda’s chairman\nannounced a desire to invest in each of the six major Hollywood studios. Since then, other\nannounced partnerships and investments have faded, principally because of Beijing’s\npushback against what it deemed to be grossly excessive, and often ill-considered, foreign\ninvestment plans by Chinese companies. 54\nConclusion and Recommendations\nThrough control of its companies operating abroad, growing influence over foreign\ncompanies, and the rapid activation of business-related United Front groups, China is\nusing commercial interests as an important means of exercising “sharp power” influence.\nAs with other sectors, much of China’s activity is, regardless of its intent, legal and thus\nshould not be disparaged. The appropriate response to this commercial challenge must be\ntemperate and multifaceted. In some areas, it will require that the political system increase\nits transparency regarding or reduce its exposure to corporate money entirely, which, given\nCorporations\n113\nits fungibility, ultimately renders any distinction between domestic and foreign sources\nmeaningless. Corporations should also provide greater clarity on their financial and supply\nchain exposure to China and disclose the presence of CCP members in joint- or wholly\nowned ventures. In certain instances, new limitations on corporate activity that is harmful\nto the national interest may be required.\nAmerican business leaders should become better versed in the evolving nature of China’s\nglobal ambitions, especially in the use of United Front tactics for influencing almost all\naspects of China’s interaction with the United States. American corporations should raise\ntheir voices through chambers of commerce or other collective commercial entities that can\ncollectively represent their interests when a company confronts pressures or coercion. To more\neffectively resist growing Chinese pressures, American corporations will most certainly need\nto find new ways to cooperate more closely with each other, and at times even in coordination\nwith the US government. Like think tanks, universities, other civil society organizations,\nand media outlets, American companies will be most vulnerable to Chinese pressure when\nthey are atomized and isolated. In this sense, the challenges with which US corporations are\nconfronted by a rising authoritarian China with a far more ambitious global agenda are not so\ndissimilar to those confronted by those other sectors of American society highlighted in this\nreport. Each confronts an un-level playing field that lacks reciprocity.\nTo help rectify these imbalances, in certain instances, the US government should be the\none to coordinate collective action, as it recently sought to do with the US airline industry.\nIt may also need to be more prepared to impose reciprocal penalties on Chinese companies\nor even compensate American companies for losses when they stand up to punitive action\nfrom China as an additional incentive to maintain resolve.\nMost important, corporate executives, their boards, and their shareholders must double\ntheir efforts to exercise the kind of principled leadership and restraint that will help them\nresist the loss of corporate control in pursuit of short-term profit. This includes not only\nindividual companies but also their representative organizations, notably the US Chamber\nof Commerce, the US-China Business Council and other specific trade associations. These\nbodies not only need to promote American business interests by pushing back against\nChinese restrictions where necessary but they also need to adopt a heightened awareness of\nthe role that corporations must play in protecting both their own interests and the national\neconomic security of the United States itself.\nIn the corporate sector, China is not just taking advantage of the openness of American\nmarkets, which are rightfully a point of pride for the United States and a pillar of our\neconomic vitality, but it is also exploiting American capitalism’s short-termism. This latter\npredilection could end up being as much of a threat to the ability of American corporations\nto maintain healthy economic relations with China as Beijing’s very strategic and targeted\nUnited Front tactics.\nSection 7\n114\nNOTES\n1 ​“Trade in Goods with China.” US Census Bureau.

Starting in 2018, joint ventures operating in China have been pressured to allow internal\nCommunist Party cells an explicit role in decision making, including investment plans and personnel\nchanges. This is but one of the most explicit signals of Chinese efforts to control foreign enterprises in\nan effort to legitimize and defend its rule and other core interests, such as its claim to sovereignty over\nTaiwan. While companies must follow the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate, China uses the\nextraordinary combination of its enormous market and its authoritarianism to enforce compliance with\nlaws and norms that deviate from practice elsewhere. Companies’ decisions to comply not only affect their\nfinancial success within China, but they can also serve to legitimize these practices internationally.\nChina’s government directs significant attention toward American technology companies in an effort to\ncontrol the flow of information in Chinese society. Many of these companies’ services in China are blocked\noutright or are subject to intrusive national security reviews or other regulatory obstacles. Regardless,\nmany American companies redouble their attempted engagement with the Chinese government. But in\nSection 7\n118\ndoing so, they not only become subject to the restrictions on Chinese technology users, but they also help\nto legitimize China’s vision for “cyber-sovereignty,” an issue that has become an important ongoing global\ngovernance debate. In some cases, they may even be inadvertently advancing China’s goals for military\ntechnological superiority. American technology CEOs, including those from Google, Apple, and Cisco, are\nprominent attendees at the World Internet Conference. At one installment of the conference, a Chinese\nantiterrorism expert argued that Beijing should increase its pressure on foreign internet companies such\nas Twitter, which he argued should be punished for tweets that “defame the party, Chinese leaders, and\nrelated national strategies.” Facebook has been notably solicitous of the Chinese government in an effort\nto enter the Chinese market, reportedly developing a tool that could be used by a third party to censor\ncontent. Despite being blocked in China, Facebook nonetheless generates significant advertising revenues\nfrom Chinese companies seeking to reach foreign consumers. As it seeks to reenter the Chinese market,\nGoogle’s willingness to facilitate that country’s national artificial intelligence priorities stand in contrast\nto its decision to end limited AI cooperation with the US Department of Defense. In June 2018, Tsinghua\nannounced that Google’s AI chief would serve as an adviser to that university’s new center for artificial\nintelligence research. The company is already involved in research at Peking University and the University\nof Science and Technology of China, among others. Artificial intelligence is a declared strategic priority\nfor the Chinese government with significant military implications. The Chinese government is actively\ncoordinating the efforts of not just its universities, but also nominally private companies such as Baidu.\nCommenting on Google’s AI China Center, at which several hundred engineers are employed, former deputy\ndefense secretary Bob Work has stated, “anything that’s going on in that center is going to be used” by\nthe Chinese military. In the summer of 2018, it was reported that Google was considering reentering the\nChinese market with a censored search engine, but Chinese government officials have discounted the\nprospect and many of Google’s own employees have expressed opposition.\nChina also seeks to enlist foreign corporations to reinforce its so-called “core interests” in ways that\nhave influenced what they feel comfortable saying even outside of China. In early 2018, for example,\nforeign companies, particularly in the travel industry, were targeted for listing Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau,\nand Tibet as separate entities on their websites rather than as sovereign parts of China. The Civil Aviation\nAdministration of China sent letters to international airlines demanding that any references to these\ndestinations except as part of China be removed from their materials and websites. In May, the Trump\nadministration declared the Chinese government’s order to airlines to be “Orwellian nonsense and part\nof a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens\nand private companies” with which they might not necessarily agree. At the direction of the American\ngovernment, the airlines initially and collectively declined to follow Beijing’s orders, as the US government\nconsidered the issue a diplomatic matter to be resolved between governments. However, when China\ndeclined to negotiate with the US government over the issue, by July the airlines partially met Beijing’s\ndemands by referring only to cities.\nTargeting foreign companies’ speech extends beyond Taiwan to China’s fraught relationship with its\nethnic minorities. At Marriott, an employee responsible for managing the company’s social media accounts\nunwittingly liked a tweet by a pro-Tibet group and was fired as a result of the backlash. The company’s\nwebsite and app were blocked in China for one week, at unknown financial cost. Daimler, the German\ncar manufacturer, was similarly forced to apologize for posting a reference to the Dalai Lama, the exiled\nTibetan spiritual leader, on social media. In the latter two cases, the companies were targeted even though\nthe social services on which they were posting were blocked inside China.

In many\ndeveloping economies, multinational corporations willingly agree to skills and technology\ntransfer arrangements in exchange for the right to operate. Governments support these\nmeasures in the hopes of furthering economic development. Transfers cross the threshold\ninto illegitimacy when coercion, misappropriation, theft, or espionage are deployed with\nthe effect of undermining a company’s, and ultimately its home country’s, economic\ncompetitiveness. China’s expropriation of American technology is an example of how\nit leverages its influence among universities, corporations, and diaspora communities to\nfurther strategic objectives. This section reviews the targets of China’s expropriation efforts,\nthe state and nontraditional collectors involved, and concludes with recommendations\nfor how the United States can better defend against this phenomenon. It is important to\nnote that not all expropriation of intellectual property occurs at the explicit direction\nof the government and that China is not the sole country targeting the United States.\nNonetheless, China—whether at the level of the state or individual—is considered the\nmost serious offender.\nWhile Chinese cyberthreats and clandestine spying against the United States dominate\nthe public discourse, a far more serious threat is posed by China’s informal or “extralegal”\ntransfers of US technology and IP theft. 1 Operating under the radar, these quiet diversions\nof US technical know-how are carried out by groups and individuals in the United States,\nwhose support for China erodes America’s technological edge and ability to compete\nin international markets. These groups are managed by a professional cadre of Chinese\ngovernment and government-associated science and technology transfer specialists who\nfacilitate intellectual property “exchanges” through a maze of venues. They target specific\nadvanced technologies drawn from China’s industrial planning priorities (e.g., Made in\nChina 2025 2 ) such as semiconductors, robotics, next-generation information technologies\n(e.g., big data, smart grid, internet of things), aviation, artificial intelligence, and electric\nvehicles. As a result of their efforts, a commission convened by the National Bureau\nof Asian Research concluded that IP theft, primarily from China, costs the American\neconomy hundreds of billions of dollars each year, with significant impact on employment\nand innovation. 3 Former commander of United States Cyber Command and Director of\nthe National Security Agency General Keith Alexander was even more grave when he\nasserted the ongoing theft of IP by China represents “the greatest transfer of wealth in\nhuman history.” 4\n122\nThe Dynamics of Chinese IP Theft\nChinese nontraditional collection and IP theft is not done randomly by individuals acting\non their own. Rather, China has enacted some two dozen laws that have created a staterun\nforeign technology transfer apparatus that sponsors, for example, labs in China that\nrely wholly on information provided by compatriots working abroad. The apparatus also\nmaintains databases of foreign co-optees and distributes stipends, sinecures, and cash to\nforeign donors of high-tech innovations. In addition, the apparatus is responsible for the\ncare and feeding of agents willing to “serve China while in place” abroad.\nTargets\nChina targets all sources of American innovation, including universities, corporations,\nand government labs, exploiting both their openness and naïveté. The methods and\ntradecraft are custom-tailored to each target. For universities, China takes advantage of the\ncommitment to intellectual freedom on campus, which strongly resists government scrutiny\nof the activities of foreign students in hard science programs and international academic\ncooperation. For corporations, the lure of the China market gives Beijing tremendous\nleverage in exacting tech transfer from American firms, combined with financial incentives\nfor employees to purloin intellectual property for personal gain. Finally, US government labs\nhave a historic commitment to international scientific cooperation, and an uneven record of\nmonitoring that cooperation for unsanctioned transfers of information.\nThese efforts complement China’s legitimate efforts to invest in its own indigenous\ninnovative capacity. China has for several decades made science and technology\ndevelopment a priority and appears to have the political will to see it through. This is\ndemonstrated by the R&D funding programs it has put into place, the investment in core\nscientific infrastructure that is in some cases unparalleled anywhere else in the world, and\na national scientifically oriented industrial policy. Yet the continuing intense engagement\nin IP theft is, in many ways, an indication of the gaps in China’s indigenous innovation\nefforts.\nOnce acquired, foreign technology is converted in China into products and weapons at\n180 “Pioneering Parks for Overseas Chinese Scholars,” 160 “Innovation Service Centers,”\n276 “National Technology Model Transfer Organizations,” and an unknown number of\n“technology business incubators.” These facilities are strategically located to ensure wide\ndistribution of the foreign technologies.\nNontraditional Collectors\nNontraditional collectors include Chinese citizens, Chinese Americans with whom the\nChinese government is better able to cultivate or coerce, and other Americans. They\nrange from students to researchers. Many are willing participants, such as students from\nTechnology and Research\n123\nChinese defense universities explicitly tasked with acquiring foreign technology; others are\nnot and targeted for access to research they have pursued by their own passion and intellect.\nIndeed, some nontraditional collectors may even be unwitting in their support.\nCollectors do not appear to be chosen by Beijing for their race or nationality; rather they\nare targeted for their access to the desired intellectual property and their willingness to\nviolate their employee agreements or national laws. Indeed, more recent scholarship has\nshattered the shibboleth that the Chinese government only recruits ethnic Chinese. While\nChinese intelligence does have a historically strong track record of attempting to recruit\nethnic Chinese, primarily because of cultural and language affinity, more recent cases of\nespionage and technology transfer suggest that the Chinese government has broadened its\ntradecraft to recruit nonethnic Chinese assets and collectors as well, perhaps as a way of\ncomplicating US counterintelligence efforts.\nChina’s most systematic channel for identifying foreign-based nontraditional collectors is\nits Recruitment Program of Global Experts ( 海外高层次人才引进计划 ), commonly known as\nthe Thousand Talents Plan ( 千人计划 ) or the Thousand Talents Program (TTP). 5 The TTP is a\nmassive and sustained talent recruitment campaign designed to recruit leading experts from\noverseas to assist in the country’s modernization drive.\nInitiated in 2008, the TTP aims to recruit leading overseas scientists and experts who work\nin areas that are deemed high priority for achieving China’s modernization goals. 6 The\nprogram originally aimed to recruit 1,000 “overseas talents” ( 海外人才 ) over a period of five\nto ten years. Official Chinese TTP websites list more than three hundred US government\nresearchers and more than six hundred US corporate personnel who have accepted TTP\nmoney. 7 In many cases, these individuals do not disclose receiving the TTP money to their\nemployer, which for US government employees is illegal and for corporate personnel likely\nrepresents a conflict of interest that violates their employee agreement.\nState Collection Apparatus\nChina’s nontraditional collection relies on a web of activities, including open-source research,\nexchanges, cooperation and professional organizations, direct funding of research, strategic\nacquisition, or cyberespionage.\nOpen-source\nChina’s efforts to exploit foreign innovation is further seen in its open-source acquisition\ninfrastructure, which surpasses that of any other country. China employs a cadre of\nthousands to locate, study, and disseminate foreign journals, patents, proceedings,\ndissertations, and technical standards without regard to ownership or copyright restrictions.\nThe documents are indexed, archived, and supplied to Chinese commercial and military\n“customers.”\nSection 8\n124\nExchanges\nThe Chinese government organizes and pays for exchanges in which participants travel\nfrom the United States, divulge technical knowledge through scripted venues, are briefed\non China’s technology interests, return to their US base to collect more information, and\nrepeat the process. China has a program for what it euphemistically calls “short-term visits”\nby co-opted foreigners, which, stripped of its rhetoric, is indistinguishable from state-run\nespionage.\nCooperation organizations and advocacy groups\nMany Sino-US S&T “cooperation” organizations in the United States facilitate these transfers\nand have individual memberships of hundreds to thousands. The figure scales to some\nninety such groups worldwide. Members usually are expatriate Chinese, although China is\nexpanding its recruitment of nonethnic Chinese. One significant example of a Sino-US S&T\ncooperation organization is Triway Enterprise, Inc. ( 三立国际有限公司 ), an “external training\ninstitute” set up under the auspices of the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs\nin Falls Church, Virginia, with branches in Beijing and Nanjing. According to the Chinese\nversion of the website, the company “since 1993 has been putting its energy into promoting\nbilateral exchange and cooperation between China and the US in the fields of S&T, culture,\neducation and management with great success.” 8\nChina S&T advocacy groups in the United States declare loyalty to China and acknowledge\na “duty” to support China’s development. Members visit China to lecture, guide Chinese\ntechnical projects, transfer technologies, receive shopping lists from Chinese entities, and\nengage in other kinds of “technical exchanges.” Many of them sit on Chinese government\nboards that decide the future of China’s national technology investment. Another\nexample of a China S&T advocacy group is the Silicon Valley Chinese Engineers Association\n( 硅谷中国工程师协会 ), which describes itself as “a non-profit professional organization formed\nmainly by the professionals in the Bay Area from mainland China with a mission to\npromote professionalism and entrepreneurship among members,” which is achieved by\n“organizing a variety of professional activities and establishing channels to allow members to\nengage in China’s rapid economic development” [emphasis added]. 9\nChinese government tech transfer offices, facilitation companies, and career transfer\npersonnel, some of whom are posted to China’s diplomatic offices, support and direct\nthe US-based groups. In China, hundreds of government offices are devoted entirely to\nfacilitating foreign transfers of technology “by diverse means.”\nJoint research\nThe preferred method of establishing a research beachhead in the United States is through\nthe formation of a joint research center with a prominent US university. One example\nTechnology and Research\n125\nis the China-US Joint Research Center for Ecosystem and Environmental Change at the\nUniversity of Tennessee, Knoxville. 10 Launched in 2006, researchers from the University\nof Tennessee and the DOE-funded Oak Ridge National Laboratory partnered with the\nChinese Academy of Sciences to address “the combined effects of climate change and\nhuman activities on regional and global ecosystems and explore technologies for\nrestoration of degraded environments.” The center’s research focuses on science at the\nheart of the “green technology” revolution, which is one of Beijing’s major national\nindustrial policy objectives.\nThe center’s website lays out three goals that match nicely with a tech transfer agenda:\n(1) organize and implement international scientific and engineering research; (2) serve as\na center for scientific information exchange; and (3) provide international education and\ntechnical training. 11 The website goes on to outline cooperative mechanisms to achieve\nthese goals, including joint research projects, academic exchange, student education, and\n“technical transfer and training [emphasis added].” 12 This dynamic differs fundamentally\nfrom the mission of Western research facilities abroad, which is to adapt technology already\nin their portfolios to sell in foreign markets. A PRC study on the benefits of overseas\n“research” to obtain foreign technology put it this way: “How can you get the tiger cub if\nyou don’t go into the tiger’s den?” ( 不入虎穴 , 焉得虎子 ). 13\nCyber\nPerhaps the most damaging channel for stealing US intellectual property is cyberespionage.\nAs noted above, NSA director Keith Alexander has called cyberespionage by Chinese state\nactors the “greatest transfer of wealth in human history.” Cyberespionage is both a means\nfor pilfering US science and technology, as well as a method of intelligence collection\nfor potential attacks against American military, government, and commercial technical\nsystems. As a result, these cyber intrusions represent a fundamental threat to American\neconomic competitiveness and national security.\nOther means of misappropriation\nWhile not technology transfer per se, counterfeiting is so common in China that it has\nthe same practical effect. Schemes range from the subtle to blatant: benchmarking against\nISO standards; 14 patent research where a design is modified slightly, if at all, re-patented\nin China and “legally” produced with government protection; 15 reverse engineering; 16\n“imitative innovation” ( 模仿创新 ) 17 with or without the innovation (also called “imitative\nremanufacturing” 模仿改造 ); 18 and marketing the pirated product without or with its original\nlogo. 19 Other reporting has detailed how the Chinese government exploits regulatory panels\n(often with members who have direct conflicts of interest by working for local competitors)\nand antitrust investigations to acquire trade secrets from foreign companies, aiding\ndomestic industries. 20\nSection 8\n126\nConclusion and Recommendations\nChina’s aggressive policy is threatening the advantages the United States has long enjoyed as a\nscientifically creative nation. This is occurring as a declining number of US students\nare getting advanced degrees in science and technology, R&D funds are dropping off,\nand the nation’s manufacturing base is shrinking. 21 When combined with a more\nscientifically competent China that is also using the discoveries of others, the future of\nUS competitiveness comes into question.\nThe best source of resiliency in the face of rampant IP theft from China is continued\nand expanded reinvestment in American innovation. The United States can recover its\ncompetitiveness by manufacturing what it invents and rebuilding the scientific foundation\non which its competitive edge depends. But unless active efforts are made to prevent\ncountries from inappropriately exploiting American technologies developed at great cost,\nefforts at national reconstruction will be wasted. The United States’ current defense of\nintellectual property has not been effective in refuting appropriation by China, by all\naccounts the world’s worst offender.\nA key source of American creativity—the country’s individualism and openness—makes\nit difficult to implement collective efforts to protect the products of American innovation.\nNonetheless, policies and processes can be improved to reduce the risk of misappropriation\nwithout compromising America’s innovative capacity. These require improved transparency\nwith better information and screening, enhanced export controls, and stronger investment\nreviews.\nTransparency, better information, and screening\nOne of the most glaring factors that facilitates IP theft is the fact that recipients of Chinese\nfunding programs, such as the Thousand Talents Program described above, routinely do\nnot declare their work in China. At a minimum, recipients should be required to register as\nforeign agents under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). 22 Recipients who are active\ngovernment employees may be breaking the law, as 18 US Code § 209 prohibits accepting\nsupplemental income for performing the same role that falls under the scope of their\ngovernment employment. 23\nThe US government and universities should also take an evidence- and risk-based assessment\nwhen determining whether to admit students into major research programs. The current\nsystem, known as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), 24 is\ndesigned “to track and monitor schools and programs, students, exchange visitors and their\ndependents while approved to participate in the US education system.” SEVIS collects data\non surnames and first names, addresses, date and country of birth, dependents’ information,\nnationality/citizenship, funding, school, program name, date of study commencement,\nTechnology and Research\n127\neducation degree level, and authorization for on-campus employment. As of March 2011,\nChina had the largest number of students in SEVIS, at 158,698. 25\nThe FBI has access to all of the student data contained in SEVIS, and no longer needs\nthe permission of DHS to initiate investigations of foreign students. 26 However, the laws,\nregulations, and directives governing SEVIS do not require some additional critical pieces\nof information, which are nonetheless perceived to be important to manage the program.\nAccording to the Government Accounting Office (GAO):\n• the nonimmigrant visa number, expiration date, and issuing post are optional and\nonly captured if entered into the system by the school or exchange visitor program;\n• the nonimmigrant driver’s license number and issuing state were imposed by the\ninteragency working group and support investigative efforts; and\n• the nonimmigrant passport number, passport expiration date, and passport issuing\ncountry are optional and only captured if entered into the system by the school or\nexchange visitor program. 27\nIt is difficult to ascertain from open sources whether these problems have been fixed, but\nthe nonmandatory data are key investigative details that would be critical for federal law\nenforcement seeking to assess possible illicit technology transfers by students.\nImproved export controls\nThe second major policy problem involves PRC student access to controlled technology\nunder the deemed export system. According to the Commerce Department, a restricted\nproduct or technology is “deemed,” or considered exported, when it is used by a foreign\nnational in the United States. 28 However, under these rules, a university or research lab\ndoes not need a deemed export license if a foreign graduate student is merely present in a\nlab. It only needs a license if it intends to export that technology to the foreign national’s\ncountry.\nFrom 2004 to 2006, the US Commerce Department attempted to change these rules, 29 but\nwas stymied by opposition from universities and research labs. 30 Yet the continued flow\nof controlled technology to the PRC and the findings of GAO studies on the problems\nof university oversight 31 strongly suggest that Commerce’s recommendations should be\nreexamined.\nIn 2009, then president Obama “directed a broad-based interagency reform of the US export\ncontrol system with the goal of strengthening national security and the competitiveness of\nkey US manufacturing and technology sectors by focusing on current threats and adapting\nSection 8\n128\nto the changing economic and technological landscape.” 32 Specifically, the initiative aimed\nto “build higher fences” around a core set of items whose misuse can pose a national security\nthreat to the United States. 33\nThe reform initiative is synchronizing the two existing control lists, the Munitions List and\nthe Commerce Control List, so that they are “tiered” to distinguish the types of items that\nshould be subject to stricter or more permissive levels of control for different destinations,\nend uses, and end users; create a “bright line” between the two current control lists to clarify\nwhich list an item is controlled on, and reduce government and industry uncertainty about\nwhether particular items are subject to the control of the State Department or the Commerce\nDepartment; and are structurally aligned so that they potentially can be combined into a\nsingle list of controlled items. 34\nMoreover, the lists will be transformed into a “positive list” that describes controlled items\nusing objective criteria (e.g., technical parameters such as horsepower or microns) rather\nthan broad, open-ended, subjective, generic, or design intent-based criteria. 35 After applying\nthese criteria, the list will be divided into three tiers based on their military importance and\navailability. 36\nOn the one hand, these reforms could greatly improve the efficiency of the export control\nbureaucracy, preventing fewer technologies from slipping between the cracks and finding\ntheir way to China. They could also make the system and its control lists better able to keep\npace with technological change, which had been a major problem with the old system,\nparticularly with regard to fast-moving information technologies. On the other hand, the\nreforms appear to loosen controls over dual-use technologies, which China has a long and\nsuccessful track record of integrating into advanced systems, and which can form the core\nof new innovations. The future of these reforms is unclear as the Trump administration\nappears to focus on more aggressive trade strategies and policies designed to protect US\nindustries and punish offending Chinese companies.\nStrong investment reviews\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an interagency\ncommittee that serves the president in overseeing the national security implications of\nforeign investment in the economy. 37 As China’s economy and financial weight has grown,\nCFIUS has reviewed an increasing number of proposed acquisitions of American companies\nand infrastructure by Chinese entities. Many of these proposed mergers have received\nhigh levels of media and congressional attention, and most of the high-profile cases have\nended in rejection or strong discouragement leading to abandonment of the deal. While\nthe CFIUS process may have prevented individual cases of sensitive or illegal technology\ntransfer, it could also have had the unintended effect of forcing Chinese actors to steal the\ndata through espionage because of their inability to buy them. Recent legislation, signed by\nTechnology and Research\n129\nPresident Trump, is a substantial improvement to CFIUS, closing loopholes that the Chinese\nhad been exploiting and broadening the scope of the CFIUS authorities in important ways.\nThe new law extends CFIUS review time-frames, increases the types of transactions\nsubject to CFIUS’ jurisdiction, makes certain notifications mandatory, and establishes a\nprocess for potentially expedited review and approval of certain transactions. The four\nnew “covered transactions” include real estate deals near US national security facilities,\ndeals involving “critical infrastructure” or “critical technologies,” changes in ownership\nrights by a foreign investor, and any transaction designed to evade the CFIUS process. In\nexchange for all these additional burdens, the new law also helps companies by clarifying\ntime limits for decisions and places important jurisdictional limits on the expansion of the\nlaw’s scope.\nNOTES\n1 ​See Hannas, William, James Mulvenon, and Anna Puglisi, Chinese Industrial Espionage.

As the accompanying graphic illustrates, the bureaucracy involved in\nextending China’s global influence is large, complex, and specialized in function.\nGenerally speaking, there are three types of bureaucratic organizations included in\nthe chart: (1) policy coordination; (2) policy formulation and implementation; and\n(3) organizations with specialized functions.\nAs a Leninist party-state, CCP organizations have higher political status than\ngovernment institutions. This has become even more pronounced under the Party’s\ngeneral secretary Xi Jinping and following the bureaucratic reorganization announced\nafter the March 2018 meeting of the National People’s Congress. Generally speaking,\nParty organs make policies, which are then implemented by state bureaucracies. There\nis no single organization overseeing the entirety of the country’s influence operations\nabroad. The most important CCP organizations in the diagram are the Foreign Affairs\nCommission, the External Propaganda Leading Group/State Council Information\nOffice, the CCP Propaganda Department, the CCP United Front Work Department,\nthe CCP International Liaison Department, and United Front departments inside the\nPeople’s Liberation Army. Critical policies related to foreign affairs are formulated\nin these bodies. The same organizations are also involved in coordinating the\nimplementation of these policies.\nThe Policy-Making Process in the Chinese Party-State\nThe process is driven both by top leadership and functional bureaucracies. Policy\nformulation, which involves the generation of ideas and proposals, typically\ntakes place in functional bureaucracies and specialized departments within these\nbureaucracies. In the process of policy formulation, one bureaucracy specializing\nin the functional or issue area (for example, propaganda) may take charge, but it\n134\nalso consults with other bureaucracies that may have a stake in the issue. The draft\npolicy proposals are then forwarded to the Leading Small Groups ( 领导小组 ), which\ndeliberate, vet, and sign off on the policy proposals before sending them to the\nPolitburo and the Politburo Standing Committee for a final decision. These leading\nsmall groups, which range in size from five to a dozen members, are normally\nchaired by a Politburo member and include a range of ministerial-level officials\nrelevant to that functional policy area. Some meet at regular intervals (biweekly),\nwhereas most convene on an ad hoc basis when necessary. In this formal, ministryor\ndepartment-initiated process, the ultimate decision-making authority lies with the\nPolitburo Standing Committee.\nAt this level of policy formulation, of particular relevance to China’s international\ninfluence activities are the External Propaganda Leading Group ( 对外宣传领导小组 ),\nwhich has a dual bureaucratic identity as the State Council Information Office ( 国务新闻办公室 ); the Central Committee Propaganda Department ( 中共中央宣传部 ); the Central\nCommittee United Front Work Department ( 中共中央统战部 ); the Central Committee\nForeign Affairs Commission ( 中共外事委员会 ); 1 and the Central Committee Education\nLeading Small Group ( 教育部 ). Although bureaucratically ranked slightly lower, the\nMinistry of Culture and Tourism, the Ministry of Education, the newly created Voice\nof China, and the Xinhua News Agency all exercise policy formulation and oversight\nroles in their functional domains.\nThere is also a parallel top-down policy process initiated by one of the top leaders\non the Politburo Standing Committee. As a rule, Xi Jinping, the CCP general\nsecretary, has broad authority and may issue a brief directive on a matter he\nbelieves should receive extra attention or priority. (Typically, such directives are\nshort comments he writes on reports that come across his desk.) Otherwise, only\na Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC) member overseeing a particular portfolio\ncan issue such directives on matters that fall into his area of responsibility. Such\ncomments are then related to the functional bureaucracies and can lead to the\nformulation of a new policy, the modification of an existing policy, or other\nactions.\nOn the Politburo and its seven-member PBSC, several members have direct\nresponsibility for external affairs. As the chair of the Foreign Affairs Commission, Xi\nhas overall authority on all aspects of China’s foreign relations. Wang Huning, the\nStanding Committee member responsible for Party affairs, ideology, and propaganda,\nAppendix 1\n135\nis the top official with oversight of China’s overseas propaganda ( 外宣 ) efforts, while\nPolitburo member and director of the CCP Propaganda Department Huang Kunming\noversees all media organs and has day-to-day oversight of the entire propaganda\nsystem. Wang Yang, another PBSC member and the chairman of the Chinese\nPeople’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), has overall responsibility for\nthe United Front portfolio, although Sun Chunlan (the only female member of the\ntwenty-five-man Politburo and former director of the United Front Work Department\nfrom 2014 to 2017) may also continue to have some residual responsibilities as well,\nsince her current portfolio includes education and culture. Additionally, You Quan, a\nmember of the Politburo Secretariat, is now the new head of the UFWD, and he is in\ncharge of the day-to-day work of the department. These leaders’ views on particular\nissues carry a great deal of weight and can often result in significant policy\ninitiatives or modifications.\nBesides issuing brief policy directives via their comments on documents (known\nas 批示 ), top leaders can also communicate their ideas or orders in conversations or\nmeetings with the ministers in charge of functional bureaucracies. Such ideas or orders\ncan lead to actions at the implementation level or to the formulation of a new policy or\nthe modifications of an existing policy.\nPolicy Coordination\nThe Foreign Affairs Commission, which used to be called the Foreign Affairs\nLeading Small Group (est. 1956), is by far the most important. The role of the\nCommission is similar to that of the interagency “principals committees” in the\nUS system. Its chairman is Xi Jinping, while Premier Li Keqiang and Vice President\nWang Qishan serve as vice chairmen. Other PBSC members Wang Huning and\nHan Zheng are members. Le Yucheng, a vice minister of Foreign Affairs, is deputy\ndirector. Other members of the Commission include the most senior leaders\nof the Chinese government: Yang Jiechi, and the ministers of Foreign Affairs,\nState Security, Defense, Public Security, Commerce, the CCP’s International\nLiaison Department, Taiwan Affairs Office, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office,\nPropaganda Department, External Propaganda Office, and Overseas Chinese Affairs\nOffice.\nThe Commission also has an attached “office,” known as the Central Foreign Affairs\nOffice ( 中央外办 ), which has a dedicated staff of approximately fifty (many of whom are\nseconded from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Liaison Department of the\nAppendix 1\n136\nCCP, other ministries, and the military). The director of this office is currently Yang\nJiechi—a Politburo member, former state councilor, and veteran diplomat. This body is\nthe central coordinating body for China’s foreign affairs—across all bureaucracies—on\na daily basis.\nWhile the Foreign Affairs Commission is the principal organization in the making\nand coordination of China’s overall foreign policy, the United Front Leading Small\nGroup and the External Propaganda Leading Small Group also have important—but\nsomewhat lower—status in the Chinese hierarchy. They are led, respectively, by the\nPolitburo Standing Committee member in charge of ideology and propaganda and\nthe head of the United Front Work Department. The Leading Small Group for United\nFront Work is located inside the CCP’s United Front Work Department and draws on\nUFWD personnel for staff work. The Leading Small Group for External Propaganda\nis subordinate to the CCP Leading Small Group for Propaganda and Ideology and\nis required to seek guidance from the Foreign Affairs Commission, and it draws on\nthe State Council Information Office (with which it has a dual role) for staff work.\nBoth groups play an important role in the formulation of policy and coordination of\nimplementation in their respective sectors.\nConferences\nAnother important instrument in the coordination of policy is the Central or National\nConferences that are convened to formulate and announce new policy objectives\nand mobilize the bureaucracy to implement these policies. Some of these conferences\nare convened more frequently and are more important than others. Four central or\nnational conferences are held to coordinate foreign policy and external influence\noperations: the Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference, the External Propaganda Work\nConference, the Central United Front Work Conference, and the National Overseas\nChinese Work Conference. These are large gatherings that last two to three days and\nare attended by key central, provincial, and local leaders, as well as various ministries\nand the Chinese military. These conferences serve to provide overall policy direction to\ncadres working in that bureaucratic system ( 系统 ) as well as to issue very specific annual\nplans for the coming year’s activities. 2\nOne measure of the importance of these conferences can be gauged by who gives the\nkeynote speech. For example, Xi Jinping gave the keynote speeches at the Central\nForeign Affairs Work Conference (2014 and 2018), the Central United Front Work\nAppendix 1\n137\nConference (2015), and the National Propaganda Work Conference (2013 and 2018).\nWhen Xi does not give the keynote speech, the Politburo member in charge of that\ndomain gives it. By contrast, the keynote speech at the National Overseas Chinese\nConference in 2017 was given by Yang Jiechi, who was at that time a state councilor\nresponsible for foreign affairs.\n• The Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference is held at irregular intervals (2006,\n2014, and 2018) to review Chinese foreign policy and announce new initiatives\nand objectives. It is attended by key ministers, ambassadors, senior military\nofficers, and local officials responsible for foreign affairs.\n• The Central United Front Work Conference, which used to be called the National\nUnited Front Work Conference, is also convened at irregular intervals (2000, 2006,\nand 2015). Both national and local officials responsible for religious, ethnic, and\noverseas Chinese affairs participate.\n• Prior to 2013, the External Propaganda Work Conference was convened annually.\nBut starting after that year, this conference has become part of the annual National\nPropaganda Work Conference. Officials in the propaganda sector from all over\nChina attend these conferences.\n• The National Overseas Chinese Work Conference was held roughly every six years\n(2005, 2011, and 2017). Only national and local officials responsible for overseas\nChinese affairs participate.\nHierarchy and Division of Labor\nThe CCP-affiliated organizations in our diagram that are involved in making policies\nconcerned with Chinese influence activities abroad enjoy higher political status\nthan those that execute these policies. What makes the Chinese system notable is\nthe division of labor, the specialization of its bureaucracies, and the staffing of these\nbureaucracies with well-trained and experienced professionals. Besides engaging\ntheir counterparts overseas, these bureaucracies either oversee or directly conduct\ninfluence operations in their areas of specialization. While there exists no single\norganization overseeing the entirety of China’s influence activities abroad (although\nif any one does have such sweeping purview, it is the Foreign Affairs Commission),\nin the implementation of policies aimed to expand Chinese influence abroad, there\nAppendix 1\n138\nare two types of bureaucracies: (1) general-purpose bureaucracies, and (2) specialized\nbureaucracies. The following institutional profiles include many of the principal bodies\ninvolved in China’s overseas influence activities.\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a typical general-purpose bureaucracy that serves\nas China’s main interlocutor with foreign governments. But since most of its time is\nconsumed by routine diplomatic activities, the Foreign Ministry itself does not play a\nsignificant role in influence operations overseas. The one area where it does is via its\nDepartment of Public Diplomacy ( 外交部公共外交司 ), which primarily oversees the MFA\nSpokesman’s Office in Beijing, international media outreach, and China’s embassy\nspokesmen abroad; international visitor programs; and “exchange” organizations, such\nas the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (which bring a range of former\nofficials and international affairs experts to China). Also, the MFA is important\ninsofar as Chinese embassies abroad have representatives of the Ministry of Culture,\nthe Xinhua News Agency, the CCP International Liaison Department, the Ministry\nof Education, and other bureaucratic bodies, each of which are involved in foreign\ninfluence activities.\nUnited Front Work Department\nThe CCP United Front Work Department is a specialized CCP organization, one of\nfour Central Committee departments. 3 Its principal mission is to build support for\nthe CCP and its policies among domestic ethnic groups, religious groups, the eight\nso-called democratic parties ( 民主党派 ), the Chinese diaspora worldwide, and political,\neconomic, and social elites in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. These United Front\nactivities have a long history dating to the CCP’s pre-1949 rise to power. The main\ntasks and objectives of the CCP’s United Front activities outside of Greater China are\nlaid out in Article 31 of the CCP Guidelines on United Front Work ( 中国共产党统一战线工作条例 ) issued in 2015—they target almost exclusively the Chinese diaspora, who\nare supposed to be encouraged to “contribute to the modernization and reunification\nof the motherland, advance the cause of opposing (Taiwanese) independence and\npromoting reunification, inherit and propagate China’s outstanding culture, and\npromote the friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the other\ncountries in the world.”\nAppendix 1\n139\nAlthough the United Front Work Department has attracted much media attention,\nand the term “United Front” has become a euphemistic one for many analysts writing\nabout China’s influence activities abroad, the scope of the UFWD’s activities in\nChina’s external influence operations is actually limited. Its primary target audience\nis the Chinese diaspora in general, and its elite members in particular. The mission\nof engaging and influencing nonethnic Chinese audiences, individuals, and foreign\ninstitutions is assigned to other specialized Chinese entities—such as the Chinese\nAcademy of Social Sciences, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Education,\nthe Ministry of State Security (e.g., China Institutes of Contemporary International\nRelations), and other institutions that have well-trained professionals and long-standing\nties with their counterparts overseas.\nInternational [Liaison] Department\nThe CCP’s International [Liaison] Department ( 中央联络部 ) is in charge of “party-toparty\nrelations” ( 党际关系 ) and has the primary mission of cultivating foreign political\nparties and politicians around the world. This Party organ has existed since before\n1949 and was formerly charged with maintaining China’s fraternal ties with other\ncommunist and socialist parties around the world, but in the wake of the Cold War,\nthe CCP/ID drastically broadened its mandate to interact with virtually all political\nparties abroad (except fascist and racist parties). Today it claims to maintain ties\nwith over 400 political parties in 140 countries, receives about 200 delegations,\nand dispatches about 100 abroad every year. CCP/ID exchanges have provided an\nimportant prism through which the CCP and other organizations in China monitor\nthe outside world and absorb lessons for China’s own modernization. This kind of\ninformation gathering goes well beyond traditional intelligence collection (although,\nto be sure, the ID also engages in this activity).\nThrough its interactions with political parties all over the world, the CCP/ID serves\nan important function as a kind of “radar” for identifying up-and-coming foreign\npoliticians before they attain national prominence and office. Having identified\nsuch rising stars, the CCP/ID brings them to China (usually on all-expenses-paid\nvisits)—often offering them their first exposure to China and trying to make the\nbest possible impression on them. Another key dimension of this function has been to\nexpose CCP leaders at the provincial and sub-provincial levels to the outside world—\noften for the first time. Many provincial Party secretaries, governors, mayors and other\nleading local cadres are taken abroad on ID delegations every year. The CCP/ID has\nAppendix 1\n140\nalso played a key diplomatic role in certain instances, such as providing a liaison\ndialogue channel between the United States and North Korea.\nIn addition, the ILD performs a range of other functions:\n• Administering “private sector” liaison organizations to facilitate contact with\nthink tanks, NGOs, and individuals worldwide;\n• Collecting current intelligence and information on the foreign policies,\ndomestic political scene and political parties, and societies in various nations\nworldwide;\n• Sending special study teams abroad to research important topics related to\nChina’s reforms;\n• Contributing to the work of Chinese embassies worldwide (usually monitoring\ndomestic politics and liaising with domestic political parties, movements, and\npersonages);\n• Working with other CCP Central Committee departments and State Council\nministries to facilitate their work overseas (e.g., assisting the United Front Work\nDepartment concerning Taiwan, the External Propaganda Leading Group/State\nCouncil Information Office concerning China’s image abroad, or the National\nPeople’s Congress on parliamentary exchanges);\n• Arranging visits of central-level, provincial-level, municipal-level, and\noccasionally sub-provincial level CCP officials abroad;\n• Hosting foreign leaders, politicians, party officials, ex-officials, as well as a range\nof foreign policy specialists, on tours of China;\n• Hosting biannual World Political Parties High-Level Meeting, and the annual\n“CCP in Dialogue with the World” meeting.\nAs such, the ILD performs extremely important roles overseas and is a key—but\nunderappreciated and even unknown—instrument in China’s international influence\nactivities.\nAppendix 1\n141\nThe State Council Information Office/External Propaganda Leading Group\nThe State Council Information Office/External Propaganda Leading Group is the nerve\ncenter and leading organ in the sprawling system of China’s international propaganda\n( 对外外宣 ) work. It maps out the entirety of China’s overseas “publicity” work, assigns\ndifferent bureaucratic entities with specific tasks, fixes budgets for entities in this\nsystem, and convenes yearly meetings to implement the annual external propaganda\nplan ( 对外宣传计划 ). The SCIO is commonly known in Chinese both as the Guo Xin\nBan ( 国新办 ) and Wai Xuan Ban (External Propaganda Office, 外宣办 ). The reason for\nthe two names is because it straddles two bureaucratic systems—the party and the\nstate. It is formally under the State Council, but it is also overseen by the Chinese\nCommunist Party’s External Propaganda Leading Group (or EPLG). This bureaucratic\nduality is what the Chinese describe as “one organ, two signboards” ( 一个机构两块牌子 ),\na reference to the white placards that hang outside the gates of all Chinese institutions\n(in this case giving the appearance of two different institutions, but in reality with\nonly one inside). As such, the SCIO is the administrative office for the EPLG, playing\na coordinating role in the media area similar to that performed by the Central Foreign\nAffairs Office (CFAO, 中央外办 ) for the Foreign Affairs Commission ( 中央外事委员会 ).\nNOTES\n1 ​This body was upgraded from Leading Small Group status in March 2018.\n2 ​These plans are normally classified and only circulated within the Chinese bureaucracies, but\noccasionally they find their way into the public domain.

But this issue is hardly\nunique to the United States—indeed, China’s influence activities now occur all around\nthe world. In some instances, notably Australia, these activities appear to have proceeded\nmuch further than they have so far in the United States. In general, they seem more\nadvanced in Asia and Europe, but there is also evidence of such activities in Africa and\nLatin America as well.\nIn order to explore some of the wider patterns that have emerged, this appendix offers\nbrief summaries of the effects of such activities in eight countries: Australia, Canada,\nFrance, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. In each\nof these settings, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has refined its efforts through\ntrial and error in order to exploit a critical asymmetry: China’s Communist party-state\nhas established barriers to external political influence at home while, at the same time,\nseizing upon the openness of democratic systems overseas.\nChina seeks to make itself more palatable to democratic societies by using many of\nthe customary vehicles of soft power—such as state-funded research centers, media\noutlets, university ties, and people-to-people exchange programs. These programs\nmimic the work of independent civil society institutions in a democracy, cloaking\nthe extent to which the party-state controls these activities and genuine civil society\nis tightly repressed inside China. In conjunction with the dramatic expansion of\nChinese economic interests abroad, the Chinese government has focused its influence\ninitiatives on obscuring its policies and suppressing, to the extent possible, voices\nbeyond China’s borders that are critical of the CCP. 1 Targeting the media, academia,\nand the policy community, Beijing seeks to penetrate institutions in democratic states\nthat might draw attention or raise obstacles to CCP interests, creating disincentives for\nany such resistance. Chinese economic activity is another important tool in this effort.\nBeijing is particularly skilled at using economic leverage to advance political goals in\nthe realm of ideas, working through indirect channels that are not always apparent\nunless one examines Chinese business activities in conjunction with Beijing’s other\ninfluence efforts.\n146\nDemocracies worldwide are reckoning with the impact of “sharp power.” 2 From Central\nEurope, where China has created the “16 + 1 Initiative,” to sub-Saharan Africa and\nLatin America, where Chinese engagement in infrastructure and the media has grown\ndiscernibly in recent years, China’s sharp power has come into view. A good deal more\nstudy is needed to understand the impact of these influence activities globally. Only\nwith such understanding and comparative case studies can democratic societies craft\nresponses that safeguard the integrity of their institutions while staying true to liberal\ndemocratic values.\nNOTES\n1 ​Sarah Cook, “The Long Shadow of Chinese Censorship: How the Communist Party’s Media Restrictions\nAffect News Outlets Around the World,” Center for International Media Assistance, October 22, 2013,\naccessed October 11, 2018, http://www​.cima​.ned​.org​/wp​-content​/uploads​/2015​/02​/CIMA​-China​_Sarah%20\nCook​.pdf.\n2 ​Juan Pablo Cardenal, Jacek Kucharczyk, Grigorij Mesežnikov, and Gabriela Pleschová, Sharp Power:\nRising Authoritarian Influence (Washington, DC: National Endowment for Democracy, December 2017),\naccessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.ned​.org​/wp​-content​/uploads​/2017​/12​/Sharp​-Power​-Rising​\n- Authoritarian​- Influence​- Full​- Report​. pdf.\nAUSTRALIA\nAustralian journalists, scholars, officials, and political leaders have found themselves\non the frontlines of a global debate on how the Chinese Communist Party is working\nto covertly manipulate the political processes of democracies around the world. The\nAustralian government has been the first to formulate a coherent and principled policy\nresponse. These efforts have had a catalyzing international impact. Randall Schriver,\nthe Pentagon’s senior official for Asia, said Australia has “woken up people in a lot of\ncountries to take a look at Chinese activity within their own borders.” 1 Hillary Clinton,\nthe former New York senator and presidential candidate, said Australia (together\nwith New Zealand) has sounded the alarm on “a new global battle.” 2 Government\nleaders in New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom have all been paying close\nattention to these growing Chinese activities. And yet, despite leading the way, effective\nimplementation is far from assured in Australia. Sustaining a counter-interference\nstrategy against the CCP—with its unrivalled resources and organization—will require\nan unprecedented degree of policy fortitude and political strategy from Australian\npolitical leaders on both sides of the parliamentary aisle as well as the support of\nbusiness leaders and the general public.\nThe Australia conversation has mostly been led by enterprising journalists and aided\nby a handful of sinologists. It has been a healthy catalytic process in which security\nagencies have been communicating warnings to institutions at risk and politicians\nAppendix 2\n147\nhave been taking security agencies and credible media investigations seriously. The\ndirector-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, Duncan Lewis,\nsaid the espionage and interference threat is greater now than at any time during\nthe Cold War due to a greater number of foreign intelligence actors and the advent\nof cybertechnologies. He said foreign interference activities range from “a foreign\npower using local Australians to observe and harass its diaspora community here in\nour country through to the recruitment and co-opting of influential and powerful\nAustralian voices to lobby our decision-makers.” 3\nMuch of the debate—particularly in its early stages—has been anchored in the\ncommunity of Chinese Australians. Ethnic Chinese writers, entrepreneurs, and\nactivists led the way in drawing the nation’s attention to the party’s efforts\nto suppress the diversity of their opinions through surveillance, coercion, and co-option.\nIn 2005, Chinese defector Chen Yonglin exposed an enormous informant network\nthat kept tabs on Chinese Australians, including Falun Gong practitioners, who\ndefied the party line. In 2008, thousands of red flag-waving students were mobilized\nto march on Canberra’s Parliament to “defend the sacred Olympic torch” against\npro-Tibet and other protestors as the torch wound its way to the Olympic ceremony\nin Beijing. 4 More recently, Chinese Australian journalists have laid a foundation\nof investigative reporting on the Chinese Communist Party’s concealed links\nto Australian politics. Philip Wen, Beijing correspondent for the Sydney Morning\nHerald, showed how the party was “astroturfing” grassroots political movements\nto give the impression of ethnic Chinese support for Beijing’s policies and leaders\nand to drown out its opponents. Over the past two years, Australian investigative\njournalists have documented a series of examples of Beijing-linked political donors\nbuying access and influence, universities being co-opted as “propaganda vehicles,”\nand Australian-funded scientific research being diverted to aid the modernization of\nthe People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Some of those reports showed how the CCP was\nusing tools of coercion and co-option to manipulate deliberations of the Australian\nParliament.\nIn 2017, CCP interference in Australian democratic processes became so brazen that\nparty officials began to use their capability for interference as diplomatic leverage. The\ntargets were bipartisan. The CCP reportedly leveraged the fact of its arbitrary power\nover Australian prisoners in China as it sought to persuade the Malcolm Turnbull\ngovernment to ratify a controversial extradition treaty. 5 And Meng Jianzhu, then\nChina’s minister of public security, warned the Labor opposition leadership about the\nelectoral consequences of failing to endorse the treaty. According to the Australian\nnewspaper: “Mr. Meng said it would be a shame if Chinese government representatives\nhad to tell the Chinese community in Australia that Labor did not support the relationship\nbetween Australia and China.” 6\nAppendix 2\n148\nIn June 2017, a joint investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and\nFairfax Media revealed that the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO)\nhad warned the major political parties that two of Australia’s most generous political\ndonors had “strong connections to the Chinese Communist Party” and that their\n“donations might come with strings attached.” 7 One of them leveraged a $400,000\ndonation in an attempt to soften the Labor Party line on the South China Sea. Most\nnotoriously, an ambitious young Labor senator, Sam Dastyari, was shown to have\nrecited Beijing’s South China Sea talking points almost word-for-word immediately\nafter the political donor had threatened to withdraw his money. Dastyari was also\nshown to have given countersurveillance advice to the donor. As a result of these\nactions, Dastyari was forced to resign from Parliament. Again, the CCP was shown to\nbe working both sides of the political aisle. The Liberal trade minister, Andrew Robb,\nwas shown to have stepped directly from office into a consultancy job to the CCPlinked\ncompany that bought a controversial lease for the Port of Darwin. The contract\nshowed Robb to be earning 880,000 Australian dollars per year (more than 600,000 US\ndollars plus goods and services tax) for unspecified services. 8\nResponse and Counterresponse\nIn December 2017, as the political attacks on Dastyari came to a head, Prime Minister\nTurnbull revealed that his coalition government had been “galvanized” by a classified\nreport into foreign interference which he had commissioned in August 2016. Turnbull\nunveiled a new counter-foreign-interference strategy which he said would be shaped\nby four principles. First, the strategy would target the activities of foreign states\nand not the loyalties of foreign-born Australians. As Turnbull put it, “Our diaspora\ncommunities are part of the solution, not the problem.” Second, the strategy would be\ncountry-agnostic and not single out Chinese interference. Third, it would distinguish\nconduct that is “covert, coercive, or corrupting” from legitimate and transparent public\ndiplomacy. And fourth, it would be built upon the pillars of “sunlight, enforcement,\ndeterrence, and capability.” 9\nAt the same time, the prime minister introduced sweeping new legislation into\nParliament. One bill introduced a wide-reaching ban on foreign political donations,\nincluding measures to prevent foreigners from channeling donations through\nlocal entities. 10 A second bill imposed disclosure obligations for those working in\nAustralian politics on behalf of a foreign principal. This bill would capture many of\nthe indirect methodologies of CCP intelligence and United Front Work Department\n(UFWD) operations that are not caught by the US Foreign Agents Registration\nAct. And a third tranche of legislation would close some large loopholes in the\nAustralian criminal law by introducing tough but graduated political interference\nand espionage offenses.\nAppendix 2\n149\nTurnbull also introduced legislation to establish a new Department of Home Affairs\nwhich, among other roles, would house a national counter-foreign-interference\ncoordinator who would integrate intelligence and enforcement and coordinate policy\ndevelopment. On December 16, 2017, at the height of this debate—and days after\nTurnbull introduced the new laws—the coalition government passed a serious electoral\ntest by winning a by-election in the Sydney seat of Bennelong. According to one\nopinion poll, two-thirds of voters support the foreign interference legislation, with just\n11 percent opposed—in a seat that has one of the largest ethnic Chinese communities\nin the country.\nAnd yet, despite this policy progress, strong evidence of electoral support, and\nfavorable international recognition, the Turnbull government found the politics and\nthe diplomacy to be heavy going. At one level this is not surprising. The CCP excels in\nusing covert and deceptive means to work preexisting fault lines of open, democratic\nsocieties. It has shown itself prepared to use the levers of economic engagement as a\ntool of political coercion. And there is no precedent for a mid-sized, open, multicultural\nnation standing its ground against a rising authoritarian superpower that accounts for a\nlarge proportion of its migrants and one in every three of its export dollars.\nAfter seizing the political and policy initiative in 2017, the Turnbull government went\nquiet over the first half of 2018. It faced pushback from powerful domestic lobbying\ngroups arguing that the proposed legislation went too far. Media firms targeted the\nespionage law, charities the donations law, and universities the proposed transparency\nlaw. Further resistance was mounted by multicultural lobbyists who maintained that\nAustralia’s reputation as an inclusive society was challenged by mention of foreign\ngovernment interference in community affairs. Prominent business leaders and\nacademics with China contracts called for an end to “China-bashing.”\nChina’s embassy in Canberra also played a part, publicly intervening as if it were\na champion of Chinese Australian communities to confront “racist bigotry” in\nAustralia. China’s government consistently portrayed the counter-interference policies\nand conversation as an attack on “China” and “Chinese people.” And Beijing framed\nCanberra’s efforts to defend its institutions as an attack on the bilateral relationship. As if\nto confirm its own judgment, Beijing was reported to have frozen ministerial and official\nmeetings across a range of key portfolios. In the ensuing silence, some of the CCP’s most\npotent narratives filled the vacuum. It was not clear that the Turnbull government could\npush through the most significant overhaul of counterintelligence legislation in forty\nyears without explaining why it was necessary.\nIt took a series of further explosive media investigations and some unorthodox political\ninterventions to regain control of the conversation and ensure bipartisan support for the\nAppendix 2\n150\nlegislation. The chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence & Security,\nAndrew Hastie, named one of Australia’s most generous political donors as a “coconspirator”\nin a UN bribery investigation and linked the affair to covert interference.\n“In Australia it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party is working to covertly\ninterfere with our media and universities and also to influence our political processes\nand public debates,” Hastie told his committee, after receiving support from the deputy\nchair, Anthony Byrne. “And it’s time we applied sunlight to our political system and a\nperson who has featured prominently in Australian politics over the past decade.” 11\nThe counter-interference criminal legislation and the foreign influence transparency\nscheme both passed through Parliament on June 28. The Home Affairs legislation had\npassed through Parliament earlier in the year, with the counter-foreign-interference\ntask force established in April 2018. This effectively elevated the importance of\ncountering foreign interference to a similar status as countering terrorism. 12 At the time\nof writing, the legislation to ban foreign political donations has not passed through\nParliament. And Turnbull himself has been replaced as prime minister. The new prime\nminister, Scott Morrison, appears to have opted for policy continuity.\nThe Turnbull government led the way in diagnosing the challenge, forging an internal\nconsensus, and setting out a bold and coherent counterstrategy. Australia became the\nfirst country in the world to lay the foundations for a sustained and coherent counterinterference\nstrategy.\nBut if Australia is going to reset the terms of its engagement with a superpower—holding\nChina to its principle of noninterference and setting a precedent of sovereign equality\nthat others might follow—then it will have to accept strains on the bilateral relationship.\nIf the government is to successfully implement a transformational strategy to defend\nAustralia’s democratic processes and social cohesion, then it has to find politically\nsustainable ways of engaging the democratic process and publicly making the case.\nNOTES\n1 ​Peter Hartcher, “Australia Has ‘Woken Up’ the World on China’s Influence: US Official,” Sydney Morning\nHerald, February 27, 2018, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.smh​.com​.au​/politics​/federal​/australia​\n- has​- woken​- up​- the​- world​- on​- china​- s​- influence​- us​- official​- 20180226​- p4z1un​. html.\n2 ​Ben Doherty and Eleanor Ainge Roy, “Hillary Clinton Says China’s Foreign Power Grab ‘A New Global\nBattle,’ ” Guardian (UK), May 8, 2018, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​. theguardian​. com​/ us​-news​\n/ 2018​/ may​/ 08​/ hillary​- clinton​- says​- chinas​- foreign​- power​- grab​- a​- new​- global​- battle.\n3 ​“Advisory Report on the National Security Legislation Amendment,” Parliament of Australia, June 7, 2018,\naccessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.aph​.gov​.au​/Parliamentary​_Business​/Committees​/Joint​/Intelligence​\n_and​_Security​/EspionageFInterference​/Report​/section​?id​= ​committees%2Freportjnt%2F024152%2F25708.\n4 ​Rob Taylor, “Chinese Rally in Australia to Guard Olympic Flame,” Reuters, April 15, 2008, accessed\nOctober 11, 2018, https://www​.reuters​.com​/article​/idUSSYD3301.\nAppendix 2\n151\n5 ​Greg Sheridan, “Malcolm Turnbull’s Chinese Double: Dishonour and Defeat,” Australian (New South Wales),\nMarch 30, 2017 (requires subscription), https://www​.theaustralian​.com​.au​/opinion​/columnists​/greg​-sheridan​\n/turnbulls​-chinese​-double-dishonour-and-defeat/news-story/55fbe920041a5f5ff7ec04b818085631.\n6 ​Primrose Riordan, “China’s Veiled Threat to Bill Shorten on Extradition Treaty,” Australian (New South Wales),\nDecember 4, 2017 (requires subscription), https://www​.theaustralian​.com​.au​/national​-affairs​/foreign​-affairs​\n/chinas​-veiled​-threat​-to​-bill​-shorten​-on​-extradition​-treaty​/news​-story​/ad793a4366ad2f94694e89c92d52a978.\n7 ​“Power and Influence: The Hard Edge of China’s Soft Power,” Australian Broadcasting Corporation,\nJune 5, 2017, expires December 7, 2018, accessed October 11, 2018, http://www​.abc​.net​.au​/4corners​/power​\n- and​- influence​- promo​/ 8579844.\n8 ​Nick McKenzie and James Massola, “Andrew Robb’s Secret China Contract: Money for Nothing,” Sydney\nMorning Herald, December 6, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.smh​.com​.au​/politics​/federal​\n/ andrew​- robbs​- secret​- china​- contract​- money​- for​- nothing​- 20171205​- gzzaq5​. html.\n9 ​Malcolm Turnbull, “Speech Introducing the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and\nForeign Interference) Bill 2017,” December 7, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, https:// www​. malcolmturnbull​\n.com​.au​/media​/speech​-introducing​-the​-national​-security​-legislation​-amendment​-espionage​-an.\n10 The debate in Australia has evolved considerably since 2009, when Prime Minister Kevin Rudd proposed\ncampaign finance reform legislation that would have rendered foreign-sourced political donations illegal,\nand Turnbull (as opposition leader in parliament) declined to support the legislation.

There are roughly\n160,000 PRC students in Canadian schools, about 70 percent of them in universities\nand colleges. Per capita, this is about three times as large as in the United States and\nroughly on par with Australia.\nCanadian experiences with Chinese interference are less intense than those documented\nin Australia and New Zealand. As early as 1997, a leaked report by Canada’s RCMP-SIS\nAppendix 2\n152\n(the Security Intelligence Service of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) identified\nimproper influence through community associations connected to Chinese intelligence\nagencies and efforts to award politically connected Canadians in high-level roles with\nChinese entities. 1 Today, the view in Ottawa is that China is definitely trying to influence\nCanadian opinion and opinion-makers but is not making much headway at present. At\nthe federal level, the greatest concern with China has to do with the acquisition, often by\nlegal means, of strategic Canadian assets such as oil sands or major companies.\nAs in other countries, Chinese state actors (the CCP International Liaison Department,\ncommercial entities, media) have targeted political parties and politicians (with a few\nongoing cases at the provincial and municipal levels that are being investigated by the\nRCMP), civil society (through Confucius Institutes and consular outreach), and academia\n(through the Chinese Students’ Association, China Scholarship Council supervision of\nstudent recipients, and pressure on Canadian China specialists). An informal survey\nof Canadian China professionals (political and business actors) and China specialists\n(research professionals) confirms some PRC state activity in all these realms. But no cases\nhave yet reached the intensity or threat documented in Australia and New Zealand.\nIn large part, this difference in intensity is due to material factors: Canada is less\ndependent economically on China than Australia and New Zealand but smaller and\nless powerful than the United States. In short, while facing similar influence and\ninterference efforts from China, Canada—like the United States—appears to have more\neffective mechanisms (diplomacy, election funding transparency, foreign investment\nregulations) than Australia and New Zealand. Indeed, in May 2018 Canada’s security\nservice produced a report warning of the extent of interference in New Zealand. 2\nPolitics\nThe Liberal government elected in October 2015 is inclined to expand relations\nwith China at the diplomatic and commercial levels, including with some form of\nbilateral free trade agreement and deeper cooperation on global issues like climate\nchange, counterterrorism, and peacekeeping. Yet, despite Asia’s rising geoeconomic\nand geopolitical weight, Canada’s strategic center of gravity remains heavily tied to\nthe United States and the transatlantic world and to Western perspectives. There are\nsignificant disagreements in the public and within government about the possibilities,\nopportunities, limits, and risks of a deeper relationship with China.\nMedia reports highlighting concerns over improper interference include the following:\n• In 2010, the director of CSIS, Canada’s national security agency, said at least\ntwo provincial cabinet members and other government officials were under the\nAppendix 2\n153\ncontrol of foreign countries (including China). 3 Facing political pressure, he later\nsaid none of the actions were “illegal” and that “foreign interference is a common\noccurrence in many countries around the world and has been for decades.” 4\n• In 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was a subject of controversy for his\nattendance at cash-for-access dinners. 5 Among the attendees were Chinese billionaire\nZhang Bin, who donated $1 million to the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation. Also\nat the dinner was Liu Meng, a CCP official who was opening a Chinese Chamber of\nCommerce, a common United Front organization, in the country.\n• In 2017, a Conservative member of Parliament was denied a visa to visit China\nbecause she intended to raise questions about human rights. 6\n• In October 2017, the Financial Times acquired a United Front teaching manual\nwhich praised the success of overseas Chinese candidates in Toronto elections,\nwriting, “We should aim to work with those individuals and groups that are\nat a relatively high level, operate within the mainstream of society and have\nprospects for advancement.” 7\n• In December 2017, the Globe and Mail reported that two Conservative senators\nhad set up a private consulting business with the intent of attracting Chinese\ninvestment to Newfoundland and Labrador. 8 The paper also reported that the\nSenate’s ethics watchdog was investigating an all-expenses-paid trip to China\nby three Conservative senators, including one involved in the consulting\ncompany. 9 (The paper had previously reported on thirty-six trips to China\nfunded by arms of the Chinese government or business groups. 10 )\n• In December 2017, Conservative senator Linda Frum called for an investigation\ninto improper influence in Canada. 11 She alleged that laws banning direct foreign\ndonations to political parties are sufficiently robust, but third-party groups—so\nlong as they receive funds six months prior to the election—can use foreign\nmoney to influence voters.\nCivil Society\nIn 2016, the New York Times reported about pressure on independent Chinese-language\nmedia in Canada. 12 In January 2018, a coalition led by Amnesty International submitted\na confidential report to the Canadian government detailing harassment and digital\ndisinformation campaigns and direct threats against Uyghurs, Tibetans, Taiwanese,\ndemocracy advocates, and members of Falun Gong. 13\nAppendix 2\n154\nBusiness\nOne of the emerging debates in Canada concerns the future of China’s telecom giant,\nHuawei, which is widely believed to have links with China’s People’s Liberation Army.\nHuawei has little significant business in the United States and was recently banned from\nparticipating in Australia’s 5G wireless network project. Now Canada is debating that\nissue, despite the fact that the firm has established a vast network of relationships with\nall of Canada’s major telecom carriers and Canada’s leading research universities. Two\nformer directors of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service—Richard Fadden and\nWard Elcock—as well as John Adams, the former head of the Communications Security\nEstablishment (CSE), told the Globe and Mail in August that Canada should also ban\nHuawei from supplying equipment for a 5G network. 14\nUniversities\nAn example from academia suggests the efficacy of Canadian efforts to combat China’s\ninfluence operations. At one West Coast Canadian university with large numbers of\nstudents from the PRC in undergraduate humanities and social science courses, where\npotentially divergent views of China and Chinese political behavior regularly form\npart of the curriculum, there has been no observation of the pressures documented\nin Australia, where professors are often openly criticized by Chinese students for\nproposing less flattering ways of looking at China. However, at that university’s forprofit\n“international transition program,” which offers international students who\ndid not qualify for admission the chance (for a fee) to prepare to meet entrance\nrequirements, university administrators have generally failed to integrate the students\nwho are overwhelmingly PRC Chinese with poor English ability into the broader\ncampus community. The result is that, even without PRC consular pressure, there is a\nstrong pro-PRC culture of “political correctness” that conforms to United Front goals\nwithout the effort to promote it. It appears that social isolation is the driving factor in\nthis case.\nConclusion\nMuch of China’s influence activities in Canada are a legitimate extension of the\npublic diplomacy in which all nations engage. The pressing issue is when and where\nChina crosses the line between influence and interference. Canadian experience so\nfar suggests more influence work than interference. However, there are clear examples\nwhere such influence has become interference. So far, it would appear that the key\nvariable for the relatively low impact of Chinese state efforts (or proxies) turns out to\nbe Canadian practice more than Chinese state efforts. That is, the internal diversity\nof the Canadian Chinese community blunts political efforts by any one political\nparty (including the CCP). More generally, Canadian practices of multiculturalism,\nAppendix 2\n155\ntransparency, campaign financing rules, business regulation, and academic integrity\nare cultivated and fairly robust.\nThese experiences suggest the following solutions or best practices in the Canadian\ncase, which largely parallel the broader report’s findings:\n• Make clear public statements of Canadian values—political, economic, social, and\nacademic.\n• Insist on reciprocity with Chinese actors in each domain of engagement.\n• Identify what harms Canadian state, social, and community interests.\n• Strengthen the practice of Canadian values of multiculturalism, open society, and\nintegration.\n• Share experiences in each sector to build capacity and promote best practices,\nparticularly engaging the Canadian Chinese community.\n• Train and make use of area specialists to better understand PRC intentions (just as\nthe PRC relies on “Western” specialists).\nNOTES\n1 ​“Chinese Intelligence Services and

theglobeandmail​\n.com​/politics​/article​-pm​-trudeau​-hazy​-on​-whether​-canada​-will​-join​-allies​-to​-ban​-chinas​.\nFRANCE\nFrance is the Western European country with the most favorable disposition toward\nChina historically, dating back to the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1964.\nYet, it is also the EU country where public opinion toward China is the most negative,\novertaking Italy in 2017. As in other countries, it is difficult to distinguish between the\nvoluntary exposure to influence by French seeking to benefit from China’s rise and\nactive efforts by Beijing to exploit French vulnerabilities.\nBoth the Left and Right in France have supported close ties with China. The dual\nnature of these ties differs from other European countries where for the most part\nthe Left has been critical of US policy in Asia and supportive of China and Vietnam.\nIn France’s case, it was the Right, under Charles de Gaulle, which recognized China\nin January 1964 and criticized US policy during the Vietnam War. So, for example, in\nJanuary 2014, an all-night celebration for the fiftieth anniversary of the recognition\nwas held in Paris with funding largely from major French firms operating in China.\nAppendix 2\n157\nBut it also means that French state television of the 1960s often aired views favorable\nto the Cultural Revolution, while Maoism was influential inside the radical Left.\nFrench diplomacy also has had its “China school,” with leading figures such as Etienne\nManach (a historical Gaullist) and Claude Martin (who recently published his memoirs\nunder a title lifted creatively from a saying by Chairman Mao, “La diplomatie n’est pas\nun dîner de gala” or “Diplomacy is not a dinner party”).\nStill, the shift in public opinion has been equally notable. Simon Leys wrote in French\nand spawned a critical tradition inside French sinology. The 1989 Tiananmen Square\ncrackdown and a demonstration condoned by the French government on the eve of the\nG-7 Versailles Summit created a lasting row with the PRC (to which arms sales to Taiwan\nin the early 1990s can be traced). President Nicolas Sarkozy’s stand on Tibet around the\n2008 Olympics kindled an even more severe controversy with China, one which also left\na trace inside French officialdom. Although diplomatic relations would be normalized\nin ensuing years, this marked the beginning of a rebalancing of France’s foreign policy\nin Asia. Today, France is a leading arms provider to Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, India,\nSingapore, and—to a lesser degree—Japan. It is the leading country—and one of only\ntwo EU countries—participating in freedom of navigation naval operations in the South\nChina Sea, albeit with more limited objectives than the United States. It has also taken\nthe lead, with Germany and Italy, in calling for investment screening by the EU, a move\nthat clearly targets Chinese attempts to obtain European high technology.\nDiaspora\nThe Chinese diaspora in France is the largest in Europe, estimated to be between\nsix hundred thousand and one million. Exact figures are not known as ethnic or\nreligious censuses are banned in France. The diaspora is not only large but diverse,\nincluding Hoa refugees from Indochina arriving in the late 1970s, Wenzhou\nimmigrants, Dongbei workers, and, more recently, students and affluent Chinese.\nWenzhou immigrants are notably apolitical, while Dongbei (northeast) people are\ncloser to PRC traditions. Very few influential French of Chinese origins come from\neither of these two groups.\nThe PRC embassy in Paris and consulates in Marseilles and Strasbourg have increased\nChina’s outreach to the various Chinese communities in recent years. Notably, actions\nwere taken to encouraging and mobilizing counterdemonstrations (largely from the\nstudent community) in Paris during the 2008 Olympics row and by exploiting the issue\nof crime against Asians (tourists or residents). In 2016, the death of a Chinese resident\nat the hands of the police spawned a very sudden and publicly condoned reaction\nin China itself, an echo and perhaps a reminder of the 2008 Olympics row. The PRC\nalso has consulates in French Polynesia and on Reunion Island, with activities more\ndirected to communities of Chinese origin that reside there.\nAppendix 2\n158\nPublic figures from the second or third generation of immigrants are emerging\nslowly. The traditionally anticommunist sentiment in Paris’s thirteenth district,\npopulated by former refugees, has all but disappeared. The district’s Socialist Party\nMP, a former advocate of Taiwan, switched his sympathies to the PRC before leaving\npolitics in 2017. While France has always seen itself as a melting pot society—where\neven native languages dissolved over a generation—the economic attraction of China\nis clearly felt.\nPolice and judicial cooperation have also become an issue. In 2017, for the first time, a\nPRC citizen accused of corruption was extradited back to China; no public assurances\nwere given regarding a possible death penalty. Another case erupted when Chinese\npublic security officials made an unannounced visit to France to pressure a resident to\nreturn home and face charges.\nPolitics\nFor decades, China’s National Day reception has been the most sought-after\ndiplomatic reception in France, with queues often backing into the street. China’s\ndiplomatic buildings have in fact sprouted up around Paris, sometimes acquired\nfrom French government sites on sale. China has cultivated a stable of former French\npoliticians. Of particular interest to China is former prime minister Dominique\nde Villepin, who is a frequent visitor to the country. He has regularly made\npositive remarks to Chinese state media and at other fora regarding the Belt and\nRoad Initiative (BRI) and Chinese cooperation with the EU. In 2018, he became\na distinguished professor at China Europe International Business School and now\nheads its advisory board.\nCivil Society\nA new generation of NGOs linking French and PRC members and sponsors has\nemerged, complementing the traditional role of business. Most prominent is the\nFrance-China Foundation, guided by an active French diplomat and presided over by\ncurrent prime minister Edouard Philippe. With prominent PRC businessmen (such\nas Jack Ma) as cosponsors and old or new members of the French establishment (e.g.,\nformer prime minister Laurent Fabius and Cedric Villani, prominent mathematician\nand an MP since 2017), the foundation hosts social events, including at the Château\nde Versailles. Its strongest activity is a Young Leaders program that is patterned after\nthe traditional Fondation France-Amérique. Other organizations include the Fondation\nProspective et Innovation, headed by Jean-Pierre Raffarin, which awards a Wu Jianmin\nscholarship named after a former Chinese ambassador to France.\nAppendix 2\n159\nBusiness\nFrance maintains a negative trade balance with China and Chinese companies have\nnot invested much in France compared to what they’ve poured into Germany, Italy,\nand the United Kingdom. Chinese investors reduced investments during the 2016–17\npresidential campaign and have also met with informal refusals in some cases, such\nas Areva, the French nuclear company. The Chinese domestic market is set to save\nFrance’s dairy industry, even creating a temporary shortage of butter for the first time\nsince 1945. Still, complaints over too many purchases—or too many tourists, for that\nmatter–—are drowned out by the profits involved.\nIn mainland France, the Comité France-Chine of MEDEF, the French business union,\nhas always been a prominent link, usually spearheaded by a prominent former French\npolitical figure (from Raymond Barre to Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and Jean-Pierre\nRaffarin). A separate French-Chinese investment fund has also been created, headed by\na former senior official in the treasury department.\nUntil very recently, Sino-French activities were largely financed by major French firms\noperating in China, with EDF, the semipublic electricity company that cooperates on\nnuclear plants with China, being the most prominent. EDF has been criticized for its\ntransfers of technology to China, which it justifies by its contracts in China and the\nUnited Kingdom with Chinese co-funding. This pattern of lobbying by the French\nthemselves may be changing. Huawei now appears as a frequent donor, including\nfor public conferences taking place in such prestigious locales as the French National\nAssembly or Senate.\nQuiet Chinese investments with ownership below the 10 percent declaratory level, as\nwell as in real estate, make for more diffuse influence. This is particularly true at the\nlocal level, where Chinese investors are eagerly sought and business intermediaries\ntend to mushroom. Many plans for industrial parks and regional airports have not\nmaterialized, however. The partial takeover of the Toulouse airport (home of Airbus\nand other aerospace firms) has been marred by the temporary arrest in China of the\nlead Chinese investor and by a search for quick profits.\nAcademia\nIn general, French academic and scientific institutions have welcomed Chinese\nstudents and researchers. The Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique (CEA), Ecole\nPolytechnique, and the Paris Saclay cluster and science park are all active in working\nwith Chinese counterparts. The Paris Saclay cluster and science park has signed\nagreements with Tsinghua University and its commercial and high-tech spin-offs,\nQinghua Holdings and Qinghua Unigroup. The Fondation Franco-Chinoise pour la\nAppendix 2\n160\nScience et ses Applications, cofounded by the French and PRC Science Academies,\npromotes stays in France for Chinese scientists. It does not list any Chinese sponsoring\nfirm. Huawei has been a major donor to the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques\n(IHES), France’s famous mathematics institution. The Fondation Victor Segalen is\na partnership between a French business school, ESCP, and China’s NDRC, and is\nsponsored by Huawei and a roster of French firms. Among the recent spate of Belt and\nRoad Initiative conferences, one at IRIS, a Paris-based think tank, was sponsored by the\nPRC embassy in France.\nMedia\nThe PRC now controls the only Chinese-language print media in France. Its TV channels\n(plus the Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV) are the only Chinese-language channels\ncarried to France and its overseas territories. In the French-language media, China does\nnot have a very strong position and the country’s officials deplore what they believe\nis negative reporting by French reporters. The PRC has had more success with the\npublishing world, where several books have appeared praising the Chinese model. The\nmost noted example is François Jullien, a literature professor turned philosopher who\nemphasizes that China’s thought is ”perpendicular to ours.” Jullien’s work is popular\namong China-oriented businessmen. Michel Aglietta, an anticapitalist economist,\npromotes China’s state-driven economy, while Philippe Barret, a former Maoist activist\nof the late 1960s turned government official and sovereigntist, published a book in\n2018 titled “N’ayez pas peur de la Chine” (“Do not fear China”).\nGERMANY\nChina has so far made only a few conspicuous efforts to exert improper interference\nin German politics, society, and business. 1 Those that have occurred, however, deserve\nattention, and, coupled with the overwhelming resources dedicated to nominally\nlegitimate influence activities, will demand a coherent counterstrategy over time.\nChinese influence activities in Germany seem sophisticated even though they\ncurrently do not appear very effective. The problem from the Chinese point of view\nis that German public opinion and its media are traditionally critical of the Chinese\nleadership. The Tiananmen Square massacre still plays an outsize role in Germans’\npublic perception of China as it fell on the same year that East Germany began to\nopen up. Thus, instead of launching a PR campaign to play on German skepticism of\nthe United States (for example), as China does elsewhere, Chinese agencies have so far\nconfined themselves to: (a) targeting younger persons—those who have a professional\nor academic interest in China; (b) weakening the EU and thus subverting a crucial\nfoundation of Germany’s influence; and (c) directing their major thrust at the one part\nAppendix 2\n161\nof German society that has a clear interest in good German-Chinese relations and thus\nis susceptible to Chinese influence: the business community.\nWhile this report has focused on distinguishing legitimate influence efforts from\nimproper interference, it is important to acknowledge behavior that is unquestionably\nillegal. Most acts of espionage have not become public knowledge. Occasionally there\nare unconfirmed reports about cyber activities and Chinese IT hardware containing\ndevices enabling espionage. In December 2017, German authorities revealed that\nChinese agents had used faked LinkedIn identities or avatars of Germans engaged with\nChina to contact people in the political and media spheres.\nPolitics\nAngela Merkel, the present chancellor, has a decidedly cool attitude toward China,\nalthough she has established mechanisms to work closely with China over the years.\nPossibly because of her experience of being raised in communist East Germany, Merkel\nclearly sees the challenges presented by China to democracy and a liberal society.\nIndeed, there’s an argument to be made that with the retreat of the United States\nfrom human rights issues, Germany has taken up the mantle as the strongest critic\nof China’s human rights practices. It was Merkel’s government that won the release\nof Liu Xia, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. Thus, it makes sense\nthat the Chinese Communist Party has opted to plant a seed within the German\nbusiness elite with the hope that in a post-Merkel Germany, China’s interests would be\naccommodated more than now.\nGermany is also an indirect target of China’s efforts directed at the 16—1 group\nin Central Europe and within the EU. Among the sixteen Central and Eastern\nEuropean countries (eleven of them EU member states) gathered in the 16—1 group,\nthe expectation of Chinese investment has led to laxer application of EU rules on\nprocurement and in some cases to opposition to joint EU criticism of China (e.g.,\nconcerning the South China Sea, human rights, and the Belt and Road Initiative).\nChinese “divide and rule” activities weaken the EU’s China policy and the EU’s\ncohesion in general and thus affect Germany negatively. 2\nThere have been limited conspicuous efforts to target specific politicians for\ncultivation, with two notable exceptions: former chancellor Helmut Schmidt (now\ndeceased) and former minister of economics Philipp Roessler. Influence activities\ndirected toward political parties are negligible, apart from efforts to include them in\nevents on the Belt and Road Initiative and the recent commemoration of forty years\nof the policy of Reform and Opening. There have been some attempts to establish\nrelations with the new right-wing party “Alternative für Deutschland.”\nAppendix 2\n162\nIn 2016, the chair of the Human Rights Committee of the German Parliament was\ntold he would not be allowed to visit China with the rest of the committee if he did\nnot delete a report from his home page on Tibetan flags being hoisted at German town\nhalls. The committee refused to go on the trip.\nAcademia\nMore than one hundred thousand Chinese nationals live in Germany, most of them\nstudents. Intense exchanges take place between universities, research institutes,\nand think tanks, as well as between scholars in many areas, both natural and social\nsciences. Similar to academics from other countries, several German researchers and\nacademics with a reputation of being critical toward the Chinese government have\nbeen denied visas or access to interlocutors in China. China in general targets junior\nscholars for cultivation. Contacts are initiated from China with invitations to join\nresearch projects, apply for grants, attend conferences, and write articles with the\npromise that they will be published.\nA notable instance of coercion occurred when the publishing company Springer Nature\nremoved an estimated one thousand publications from its Internet catalog for China\nbecause their titles might not coincide with official political positions of Beijing. So far,\nSpringer has yet to reverse its decision, unlike Cambridge University Press in a similar\ninstance.\nGerman universities host twenty Confucius Institutes (out of approximately 160 in\nall of Europe). Like their counterparts elsewhere, they invest more in gaining general\nsympathy in German civil society through cultural activities than in advancing an\novertly political agenda (which does occur, although rarely). There are fifty-eight\nChinese Students and Scholars Associations in Germany that are well organized and\nseemingly well funded.\nCivil Society\nChinese officials regularly complain about the negative attitude toward China in the\nGerman public, proven by polls, but do not yet tackle the problem directly. Activities\nin the PRC by German nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and political\nfoundations are increasingly confined in their activities, not only through China’s\nnew NGO law but also because former Chinese partners are reluctant to cooperate.\nIn a letter to the interior ministries of German federal states, the Chinese embassy\nrequested that communities be asked not to hoist Tibetan flags on Tibet Day\n(March 10). In some cases, ministries complied, but in the majority of cases they\ndid not. Almost none of the communities complied. The Chinese embassy in Berlin\nAppendix 2\n163\nintervened with hotels where activities involving Taiwan (such as trade shows) flew\nthe flag of the Republic of China. Probably in view of the costs incurred by cancelling\na contract with their Taiwanese partners, the addressees in general did not comply.\nIn a similar incident, at the first of a series of tournaments between German third\nleague soccer clubs and Chinese soccer clubs, the Chinese coach demanded that\nspectators be forbidden from holding up Tibetan flags. The German soccer association’s\nrepresentative did not comply and no more football matches have been held.\nBusiness\nClose relationships, often decades old, between various enterprises and business\nassociations (including a newly established one on the Belt and Road Initiative) are\nnurtured by the Chinese embassy, consulates, and representatives from Beijing. The\nChinese government provides financial and logistical support for events like the\nHamburg Summit or Asia Pacific Days in Berlin. A long-standing practice has been to\ninclude CEOs of major enterprises in advisory boards of mayors of major Chinese cities\nand provinces (remuneration seems not to play a role).\nThe issue of “weaponized” investment is growing in importance. In 2016, Chinese\ncompanies spent 12.5 billion euros on investments in Germany—about as much as the\ntotal investment of the entire previous decade. The main targets have been successful\ntechnology companies. The blitz has subsided in the wake of greater political scrutiny\nbeginning in 2017 and German efforts, along with those of the United Kingdom and\nFrance, to limit China’s ability to buy, borrow, or steal leading European technology.\nGerman enterprises in both China and Germany are major targets for information\ncampaigns related to the Belt and Road Initiative. Enterprises generally respond\npositively although with circumspection (only 36 percent of German companies in\nChina expect positive effects for their business). Especially large enterprises (e.g.,\nSiemens) have played along and created their own “BRI Task Forces.” Siemens CEO\nJoe Kaeser said in Davos in 2018 that the Belt and Road would become the “new\nWTO.” Similar to instances elsewhere, when the Daimler company used a quote from\nthe Dalai Lama on its Instagram account, it was confronted with massive protests in\nChina’s media and it apologized publicly—twice—to China. The city of Duisburg (one\nof the terminals of the trans-Eurasian railroads) in January 2018 reached a “strategic\ncooperation” agreement with Huawei to turn Duisburg into a “smart city.” That entailed\nhaving Huawei build a “Rhine Cloud” to host Duisburg’s data. 3\nMedia\nGerman media have, for decades, been the target of official and unofficial Chinese\ncriticism that they are “anti-Chinese.” China’s state-run media have sought to\nAppendix 2\n164\nmake some inroads into the mainstream German press. China Daily’s advertisement\nsupplement, China Watch, is published in only one daily, after readers protested its\ninclusion in another paper. In 2017, China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency partnered\nwith a German firm, the German Television News Agency or DFA, to provide soft\nfeatures about how important China is to Germany. Called Nihao Deutschland, the\nprogram has been criticized as propaganda in the mainstream German press. 4\nReaction\nIt is in business, the one area of tangible Chinese influence efforts, where pushback\nhas begun in Germany. Chancellor Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron\nhave initiated discussions with businesses and the EU Commission on ways to\nestablish stricter investment screening procedures and to push for more reciprocity for\nEuropean firms in China. In April 2018, the second chamber of the German parliament\n(representing the federal states) passed a resolution to lower the threshold at which the\ngovernment may intervene in foreign direct investment (FDI) projects in Germany.\nThe measure was clearly targeted at China. As for the EU, the German government has\nsupported language that criticizes the BRI concept for hampering free trade and putting\nChinese companies at an advantage. 5\nConclusion\nMany of the coercive actions documented here are for the most part measures one\nmight imagine German diplomats abroad also adopting. What raises questions are\nthe size of China’s activities and its objectives. China can wield massive resources in\npushing its public diplomacy agenda. This can turn German and European partners\ninto pawns. The outsize dimension of China’s influence efforts can render them\nimproper or even illegitimate. China’s efforts on the investment side often involve\ndraining technical know-how from German firms. On the political side, its support of\nCentral European countries has been carried out with the aim of dividing the primary\npolitical organization of Europe, the EU. Neither of these can be regarded as proper and\nlegitimate behavior between states.\nThe risk of Chinese interference in Germany is serious in the medium to long term,\neven though so far it is mainly an indirect one and German society by and large has\nproven sufficiently resilient. A preliminary recommendation on how to prevent the\nproblem from becoming more serious would be to focus on more cohesion, exchange,\nand transparency among countries concerned, first of all within the EU. This will\ntake time and effort, considering that some countries in Europe (such as a few Eastern\nEuropean nations along with Greece) hope to use their support of China’s political or\ntechnological goals to lure Chinese investment. Still, as a leader of Europe, Germany—\nalong with France—needs to initiate a broad-based discussion among the public and\nAppendix 2\n165\nthe business community about the challenge presented by China’s economy and\npolitical system and its objectives.\nNOTES\n1 ​The recent reports by ECFR and Merics/GPPI list some of them, but mainly deal with Europe in general:\nFrancois Godement and Abigael Vasselier, “China at the Gates: A New Power Audit of EU-China Relations,”\nEuropean Council on Foreign Relations, December 1, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, http:// www​. ecfr​. eu​\n/publications​/summary​/china​_eu​_power​_audit7242; and Thorsten Benner, Jan Gaspers, Mareike Ohlberg,\nLucrezia Poggetti, and Kristin Shi-Kupfer, “Authoritarian Advance: Responding to China’s Growing Political\nInfluence in Europe,” MERICS, February 2018.\n2 ​Then foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel on August 30, 2017, in a speech asked China to respect the “One\nEurope Principle” as much as it demands Europeans respect the “One China Principle.”\n3 ​Achim Sawall, “Duisburg und Huawei Starten die Rhine Cloud,” Golem.de, June 11, 2018, accessed\nOctober 11, 2018, https://www​.golem​.de​/news​/du​-it​-duisburg​-und​-huawei​-starten​-die​-rhine​-cloud​-1806​\n- 134892​. html.\n4 ​“ ‘Nihao Deutschland’ Zeigt Deutschen China,” Hamburger Abendblatt, August 8, 2017, accessed\nOctober 11, 2018, https:// www​. abendblatt​. de​/ kultur​- live​/ tv​- und​- medien​/ article211511923​/ Nihao​\n- Deutschland​- zeigt​- Deutschen​- China​. html.\n5 ​Dana Heide, Till Hoppe, Klaus Stratman, and Stephan Scheur, “EU Ambassadors Band Together Against\nSilk Road,” Handelsblatt, April 17, 2018, accessed October 11, 2018, https://global​.handelsblatt​.com​/politics​\n/ eu​- ambassadors​- beijing​- china​- silk​- road​- 912258.\nJAPAN\nJapan would seem to be the perfect target for the Chinese party-state and its under-theradar\nefforts to turn potential adversaries into benign friends. Japan has deep cultural\nand emotional ties with China, through history, language, and art, and a sense of Asian\nfraternity forged by their struggles to keep intrusive, overbearing Western powers at\nbay. Many in Japan also carry an enduring sense of remorse for their country’s brutal\nsubjugation of China in the opening half of the twentieth century. However, the\nkinds of covert Chinese influence operations that have come to light in countries like\nthe United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Europe—with one\nexception—are not easy to find in Japan.\nA natural place to look for evidence of influence-peddling would be in Chinese\nsupport for the left-wing Japanese peace groups that have long investigated and\npublished evidence of the Imperial Army’s war atrocities in the 1930s and 1940s.\nSuch Japanese research has been politically useful for China in buttressing its own\nefforts to chronicle the sufferings of its people during the conflict, as well as lending\nsupport to Beijing’s tussling with Tokyo over how the history of the war should be\nmanaged and told.\nAppendix 2\n166\nBut Japanese activists have never needed encouragement from China on this front.\nThey lead homegrown movements with specific political targets in Japan itself,\nnotably attacking the conservative establishment and defending the country’s “peace\nconstitution.” These well-established groups, the origins of which lie in the Cold War\nsplits of 1950s Japanese politics, have long been attacked from the right in Japan for\nbeing unpatriotic. But none has been linked credibly to Beijing’s United Front Work\nDepartment. Nor is there evidence that they have been manipulated and managed by\nCCP-aligned or directed interests.\nThe Japanese Communist Party, which still retains a substantial electoral base, is little\nhelp to Beijing on the ground in Japan. The JCP was pro-Soviet through the Cold War\nand has no special affinity with Beijing.\nJapan’s cultural and institutional familiarity with China makes it, in different\nways, less amenable to Chinese influence than it would appear to be at first blush.\nAfter all, Japan has absorbed much from China over many centuries, taking in\nwhat it wanted and adapting it to its own ends, and keeping out much else. On\ntop of that, any notions of Asian solidarity have been subverted since the early\ntwentieth century by war and politics and by the failure of the two countries to\nreach an equilibrium in the aftermath of Japan’s defeat in 1945 and the victory of\nthe Chinese communists in 1949.\nProductive Back Channels\nThe opaque political cultures of both countries have shaped the way that bilateral\nrelations are conducted. Aside from conventional diplomacy, leaders of the dominant\npolitical parties in China and Japan have extensively used back channels to establish\nunderstandings on sensitive issues, including the overt use of CCP organs, outside of\nnormal state-to-state relations.\nThe Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, headed by\nLi Xiaolin, the daughter of former Chinese president Li Xiannian, has long been\na forum through which the two sides have conducted dialogues. The Friendship\nAssociation is effectively the public face of the CCP’s UFWD. It is not covert and,\nfor all the connotations conjured up in its name, it remains avowedly an arm of the\nparty-state. In that respect, the Friendship Association remains a reliable conduit for\npassing messages between the two countries, especially at a time, as in recent years,\nwhen senior-level political exchanges have been fraught. When bilateral relations\nfroze in 2012 after the clash over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, it was a measure of\nhow dangerous things became that the back channels, or the “pipes,” as the Japanese\ndescribe them, froze, making diplomatic signaling difficult across the East China Sea.\nAppendix 2\n167\nOkinawa and Senkaku/Diaoyu Debates\nThe clearest case of covert meddling occurs far south of Tokyo in Okinawa, the\nancient island-kingdom which is geographically closer to Taiwan than it is to the\nJapanese mainland. As late as 2015, prominent Chinese were asserting that the Ryukyu\nIslands, which include Okinawa, belonged as much to Beijing as they did to Japan. In\nlarge part, they based their argument on the fact that the chain was once a Chinese\ntributary state. The two countries still hotly contest this island chain, known as\nSenkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. “I am not saying all former tributary states\nbelong to China, but we can say with certainty that the Ryukyus do not belong to\nJapan,” wrote Luo Yuan, a retired and hawkish People’s Liberation Army general. 1\nChinese scholars have argued that Japan’s annexation of the islands in 1879 was an\ninvasion and that the sovereignty of the island chain is thus open to question. For the\ntime being, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has not pressed this issue.\nHong Kong has long been a base for flag-waving Chinese activists agitating on the issue\nof the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Their appeals to a notion of Chinese brotherhood,\ncombined with the fact the group writes in traditional Chinese characters, suggests\nthat the main consumers of the Organizing Committee for the Ryukyus propaganda\nmay not be on mainland China. Instead, the Organizing Committee may well be\ntargeting supporters of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, where hard core supporters of\nunification have become marginalized in mainstream politics, or overseas Chinese\ncommunities. 2\nIt is of some significance that the same individuals who make up the Organizing\nCommittee are also listed online as serving in CCP United Front Work Department\npositions in Hong Kong. 3 The Organizing Committee for the Ryukyus also has a robust\nonline presence, with both a website and a Weibo (similar to Twitter) account. 4 It is\nworth noting, also, that the Hong Kong-based campaign to regain the Ryukyus has not\nwon any overt or consistent support from Beijing.\nBut the Hong Kong patriots’ campaign has the benefit of being aligned with anti-\nJapanese sentiment in Okinawa itself, where both political leaders and the local media\nare antagonistic toward Tokyo. The local discontent is directly related to the longstanding\npresence of tens of thousands of US military personnel stationed on the\nisland and the ways in which they have interacted with the indigenous population.\nOperating at arm’s length from the government, however, a cabal of self-styled\nChinese patriots in Hong Kong has openly agitated for the Ryukus (Senkaku/Diaoyu)\nto be taken from Japan and to become part of China. The main group calls itself the\n“Organizing Committee for the Ryukyu Islands Special Administrative Region of the\nAppendix 2\n168\nChinese Race.” 5 Hong Kong has long been a base for flag-waving Chinese activists\nagitating on the issue of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. “The Chinese race does not\nfight wars. The Chinese race only safeguards peace!” runs one pronouncement which\nwas designed as an outreach to potential supporters on Okinawa. “The Chinese race\nis relying on you. The Chinese race today relies on you, and the Chinese race can\nrely on you.” 6 Even more extreme is the way that the group frames its assertion that\nthe Ryukus (Senkaku/Diaoyu) should become part of China. “The Japanese people\nare a part of the Chinese race and Japan is originally of Chinese blood,” the group’s\npresident, Zhao Dong, says in one posting.\nFor the CCP in Beijing, with an eye on the long game, building links between\nmalcontents in Okinawa and patriots in Hong Kong could easily pay off in the future.\nCountering Chinese Influence\nThe Japanese government has been at the forefront of attempts to counter Chinese\nefforts for influence throughout Asia. It maintains a robust, if under-the-radar,\nrelationship with Taiwan. It has strong ties to Vietnam and it has attempted to\nmodify China’s influence over Cambodia and Laos, although to little effect. Japan\nhas a close relationship with New Delhi that involves not simply trade but also\nsecurity. Japan and India recently unveiled the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor as a\nway to compete with Chinese influence in Africa. Japan’s ties to Australia are deep\nas well. 7 Japan’s government was the source of the expression “Free and open Indo-\nPacific” as a counterpoint to China’s attempts to turn the Western Pacific (or at least\nthe South China Sea) into a Chinese lake. Moreover, Japanese firms currently are\noutpacing Chinese firms in terms of infrastructure investment in Southeast Asia.\nNOTES\n1 ​Justin McCurry, “China Lays Claim to Okinawa as Territory Dispute with Japan Escalates,” Guardian (UK),\nMay 15, 2013, https:// www​. theguardian​. com​/ world​/ 2013​/ may​/ 15​/ china​- okinawa​- dispute​- japan​- ryukyu.\n2 ​Taiwanese newspapers have already covered the Organizing Committee in a rather disparaging fashion:\n“Pushing Japan to Hand Back the Ryukyus: Chinese People Draw up an International Lawsuit,” “ 促日歸還琉\n球中國人擬告上國際法庭 ,” Liberty Times (Taiwan), August 2, 2016, accessed October 11, 2018, http:// news​. ltn​\n. com​. tw​/ news​/ world​/ paper​/ 1017100.\n3 ​“China Brilliant Cause Investment Group CCTV International News Introduction,” Yanzhao Nightly/\nShijiazhuang Daily, accessed October 11, 2018, http://www​.hnqxgs​.com​/yzwbfz​/2196344​.html.\n4 ​“Organising Committee for the Ryukyu Islands Special Administrative Region of the Chinese Race,”\nWeibo, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.weibo​.com​/u​/1931192953​?is​_hot​=​1.\n5 ​Ryukyu Network, Organising Committee for the Special Administrative Region of the Chinese Race,\naccessed October 11, 2018, http://www​.ryukyu​-china​.com.\nAppendix 2\n169\n6 ​“ 中華民族琉球特別自治区」の正体は . . . ​ 中国共産党中央統一戦線工作部 ,” Japan+, November 10, 2015,\naccessed October 11, 2018, http://japan​-plus​.net​/952.\n7 ​Daniel Moss, “As China Steps Up, Japan Isn’t Stepping Aside,” Bloomberg, July 10, 2018, accessed October 11,\n2018, https://www​.bloomberg​.com​/view​/articles​/2018​-07​-10​/japan​-reasserts​-influence​-as​-china​-rises.\nNEW ZEALAND\nThe issue of Chinese influence operations in New Zealand began to attract significant\nattention in September 2017 when Anne-Marie Brady, a professor at the University of\nCanterbury, published a detailed assessment of that country’s experience in the weeks\nprior to national elections. 1\nChina’s influence operations in New Zealand are rooted in the same set of policies\nand institutions that guide its work globally, often proceeding outward from efforts\ntargeted at the diaspora community. As has been observed elsewhere, influence\noperations in New Zealand have increased markedly since Xi Jinping became general\nsecretary of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese government considers New\nZealand an “exemplar of how it would like its relations to be with other states.” 2 One\nunnamed Chinese diplomat even characterized relations between the two countries as\nsimilar to China’s close ties with totalitarian Albania in the early 1960s.\nNew Zealand is of strategic interest to China for several reasons. As a claimant state in\nAntarctica, the country is relevant to China’s growing ambitions in that territory. It\nmanages the defense and foreign affairs of three other territories in the South Pacific.\nIt is an ideal location for near-space research and has unexplored oil and gas resources.\nMost critically, as a member of the “Five Eyes” security partnerships with the United\nStates, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, New Zealand offers enormous\npossibilities for Chinese espionage.\nNew Zealand is particularly vulnerable to Chinese influence because it is a small state\nof 4.5 million people with strong trade ties to China. China is New Zealand’s second\nlargest trading partner and a critical market for two of its most important sectors,\ntourism and milk products. It should be noted that New Zealand has historically\npursued closer ties with China than many other nations. What is changing is the\nwillfulness with which China appears ready to exploit this dynamic and to subvert\nNew Zealand’s continued ability to independently shape its policy priorities.\nExamples of improper influence in New Zealand include revelations that a member of\nParliament concealed that he had been involved with Chinese military intelligence for\nfifteen years prior to immigrating to New Zealand; a New Zealand company found to\nAppendix 2\n170\nbe violating bans on exports to North Korea via its Chinese partner; and the almost\ncomplete domination of local Chinese-language media by pro-PRC outlets.\nChinese Diaspora\nThere are currently two hundred thousand ethnic Chinese in New Zealand, primarily\nconcentrated in Auckland. During the Cold War, Chinese New Zealanders “were neither\npro-CCP nor pro-PRC” and its community institutions were “proudly independent.”\nNow, few activities are noticeably independent of Beijing.\nIn addition to its embassy in Wellington, Beijing coordinates its engagement with the\ndiaspora through an Overseas Chinese Service Center, established in Auckland in 2014.\nThe organization considered most closely connected with PRC authorities in New\nZealand is the Peaceful Reunification of China Association of New Zealand, which was\nfounded in 2000. Controlled by the United Front Work Department, it has encouraged\nbloc voting in the ethnic Chinese community, fund-raising for friendly ethnic Chinese\npolitical candidates, and organizing of protests. The current leader of the association,\na businessman in the food industry, also heads or has leadership roles in other United\nFront organizations in New Zealand and has been publicly listed as an adviser to the\nBeijing Overseas Chinese Affairs Council.\nSeveral current ethnic Chinese individuals active in New Zealand work “very publicly”\nwith China’s United Front Organizations in New Zealand. 3 In return they have\nbenefited from fund-raising events held by the Peaceful Reunification Association,\nwhich has encouraged ethnic Chinese to vote for them. In the 2017 elections, a woman\nwho led the New Zealand Chinese Students and Scholars Association was placed on\nthe Labour Party’s election slate, but the party did not receive enough votes for her to\nenter Parliament. Chinese individuals active in New Zealand politics have also attended\nPeaceful Reunification Association meetings, where they stated their intention to\npromote China’s policies with respect to Tibet, promoted a think tank tied to the Belt\nand Road Initiative, and repeated slogans from Xi Jinping in local campaign materials.\nPolitics\nIn 2017, it was disclosed that Yang Jian, who to date remains a member of\nParliament, concealed that he had been a student and teacher at two of China’s\nmilitary intelligence colleges for fifteen years before immigrating to New Zealand.\nHe omitted this history on his English-language resume for his position at a New\nZealand university, his permanent residency and citizenship applications, and his\nparliamentary position, but he disclosed it selectively to those speaking Chinese.\nYang has acknowledged the veracity of these reports, including that he was a member\nof the Chinese Communist Party, but claims he ceased his affiliation after leaving\nAppendix 2\n171\nthe country in 1994. Since entering government, Yang “has been a central figure\npromoting and helping to shape the New Zealand National government’s China\nstrategy” and was a member of the Parliamentary Select Committee for Foreign Affairs,\nDefense, and Trade from 2014 to 2016, which would have given him privileged access\nto information. 4\nChinese influence efforts targeted toward New Zealand politics transcend the diaspora\ncommunity to include campaign contributions and the cultivation of relationships with\nformer senior officials. Individuals with strong ties to United Front organizations have\ndonated several million dollars, primarily to the National Party. One such individual, who\ndonated $112,000 to the National Party in 2017, is listed as an officer of no fewer than\nseven United Front organizations. 5 Senior politicians who have secured high-profile roles\nin Chinese companies include a former party leader and members of Parliament who\nserve on the boards of the New Zealand affiliates of major Chinese banks. A former\nminister of finance serves on the board of a majority-Chinese-owned New Zealand\ndairy. In late September, a former prime minister who now represents an American\ncompany’s interests in China attracted attention for the sale of property “well above\nmarket rates” to an undisclosed Chinese buyer. Local politicians have also been\ntargeted.\nBusiness\nChinese companies have also been instruments of interference in New Zealand. After\nacquiring a stake in a local telecom company in 2011, Chinese telecom giant Huawei\nwent on to win the contract to build New Zealand’s 4G wireless network in 2013.\nHuawei also established research partnerships and other investments in the country\nthat may be leveraged for nonbusiness purposes. In another instance, New Zealand\naeronautics company Pacific Aerospace in 2014 partnered with Beijing Automotive\nGroup on the sale of planes to the Chinese market. In 2017, Pacific Aerospace was\ncharged by New Zealand Customs with knowingly and illegally exporting parts to\nNorth Korea via its Chinese partner.\nUniversities\nNew Zealand has long-standing scientific cooperation agreements with China, most\nof which are benign. However, since China renewed an emphasis on civil-military\nresearch integration in 2015, New Zealand, like other countries hosting major\nresearch institutions, has been targeted for its potential to further these aims. New\nZealand universities have partnerships with several Chinese universities linked to\nChina’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), including the PLA Institute of Military\nCulture (Massey); the National University of Defense Technology (Auckland, Massey);\nNorthwestern Polytechnical University (Canterbury), Shenyang Aerospace University\nAppendix 2\n172\n(UNITEC), and Xidian University (Otago, VUW). New Zealand regularly hosts doctoral\nstudents who were graduates of these universities and also hosts current students\nand staff on short-term fellowships. Some New Zealand academics have roles at PLAlinked\nuniversities. The potential for these relationships to be exploited requires a\nreevaluation of government policies on scientific exchange. 6\nCivil Society\nMedia are a key target of China’s influence efforts. New Zealand’s local Chineselanguage\noutlets all have content cooperation agreements with China’s Xinhua News\nService, participate in annual media training conferences in China, have at times\nemployed senior staff affiliated with the Communist Party, and have hosted CCP\npropaganda officials. CCP officials have given direct editorial instructions to Chineselanguage\nmedia in New Zealand as part of the CCP’s strategy to blend overseas\ncontent with that in the PRC. On television, a Chinese-language channel has removed\nTaiwanese programming from its network. Xinhua has also established its own\ntelevision station.\nWith respect to English media, China Daily in 2016 established a partnership with\nthe Fairfax newspapers in Australia and New Zealand. The Chinese embassy has\nsponsored the travel of journalists and politicians. In other instances, donors with\nclose connections to the Chinese government have donated to organizations that\nprovide research funding and subsidize journalist and youth visits to China, as well as\nexhibitions, book publications, and other activities that “promote a non-critical view\nof China.”\nChina’s representatives in New Zealand also put considerable pressure on New\nZealanders who speak up critically on China-related issues. Since publication of her\ninitial report on Chinese influence operations in the country, Anne-Marie Brady\nhas experienced break-ins at her office and home, according to testimony before the\nAustralian Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee. 7\nConclusion\nNew Zealand’s government, unlike that of Australia, has taken few steps to counter\nforeign interference in its internal affairs. Charity fund-raising, which has been used\nby Chinese United Front organizations to mask contributions, remains excluded from\ndisclosure requirements. New Zealand’s intelligence service still cannot investigate\ncases of subversion and foreign influence inside its political parties without the\napproval of the service’s minister, whose political calculations may inhibit action. And\nmedia regulations remain inadequate to address improper influence by means other\nthan outright ownership, which may also merit reform.\nAppendix 2\n173\nNOTES\n1 ​Anne-Marie Brady, “Magic Weapons: China’s Political Influence Activities under Xi Jinping,” Kissinger\nInstitute on China and the United States, September 18, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, https:// www​\n. wilsoncenter​. org​/ article​/ magic​- weapons​- chinas​- political​- influence​- activities​- under​- xi​- jinping.

Singapore is also unique in Southeast Asia\nbecause its rigorous standards of governance and zero tolerance for corruption make it\nvirtually impossible to bribe or openly suborn political leaders or opinion-leaders.\nIn 2016–17, Singapore’s generally friendly, smooth relationship with China took a\ndownturn. The proximate cause was Singapore becoming country coordinator for\nChina for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This post is held\nby ASEAN member states by rotation for a three-year term. China seemed to have\nconvinced itself that the role entailed Singapore “coordinating” ASEAN’s position on\nthe South China Sea (SCS) territorial disputes in its favor. But China has long been\nunhappy with Singapore’s clear and consistent position on the SCS. Singapore is not a\nclaimant state to the South China Sea. The previous country coordinator was Vietnam,\na claimant state whose relationship with China has been historically fraught. Chinese\nexpectations of Singapore may have been unrealistically high, particularly after the\nArbitral Tribunal on the case brought by the Philippines against China ruled against\nChina’s position in a verdict in July 2016.\nChina criticized Singapore’s support for SCS disputes being resolved in accordance with\ninternational law as “taking sides.” It objected to Singapore’s leaders and officials even\nspeaking on the SCS issue. When Singapore stood firm on its right to state its position\non an issue of undoubted importance to the region, the Chinese influence apparatus\nAppendix 2\n174\nwas activated to pressure the government to change position. Singapore’s experience in\n2016–17 holds lessons for other ASEAN member states.\nOn the surface, China claims that it does not interfere in the internal affairs of other\nstates. At the same time, it is led by a Leninist party that embraces the ideas of the\nUnited Front as a key tactic. Translated into foreign policy, by its nature United Front\nwork involves lobbying, coercion, co-optation and other influence operations—some\nof which are legitimate, others of which are not. China’s self-declared role as the\nrepresentative of all Chinese people around the world and its stated position that all\nChinese are obliged to help China further complicate its position in Singapore, which\nis 76 percent Chinese.\nThis multifaceted and contradictory approach is deployed within an overarching\nnarrative of China’s inevitable and unstoppable rise and America’s equally inevitable\nand absolute decline. This narrative and others are propagated by various means:\nWeChat with Chinese-speaking populations, social and mainstream media, whispering\ncampaigns, business, clan, and cultural associations, and conventional agents of\ninfluence reporting to Chinese intelligence organizations, who cultivate what Lenin\ncalled “useful idiots.”\nA History of Influence\nChinese influence operations in Singapore are not a recent phenomenon. China’s\nUnited Front activities in the late 1950s and 1960s sought to export China’s communist\nrevolution to Southeast Asia and were part of an open political struggle. But even after\nChina’s proxies in the political contest were defeated, China continued to try to shape\npublic opinion in Singapore. This attempt differed from the 2016–17 episode mainly in\nthe means deployed, which reflected the technologies available at the time.\nOn May 15, 1971, the Singapore government announced the arrest and detention of\nthree individuals under the Internal Security Act. The government press statement\nrevealed that “officials of a communist intelligence service based in Hong Kong”\nhad between 1964 and 1968 given loans totaling more than 7 million Hong Kong\ndollars at the “ridiculously low interest rate of 0.1% per annum” to an ethnic Chinese\nbusinessman to start an English-language daily newspaper named the Eastern Sun. 1 The\nnewspaper commenced publication in 1966. In return for the loans, the Eastern Sun was\nrequired not to oppose the PRC on major issues and to remain neutral on minor issues.\nIn 2004, China deployed intense pressure on Singapore when then deputy prime\nminister Lee Hsien Loong paid an unofficial visit to Taiwan. The Chinese were trying\nto get Singapore to cancel the visit. Singapore adheres to a “One China Policy,” but if\nAppendix 2\n175\nChina had succeeded, it would have forced a significant modification of Singapore’s\napproach to Taiwan.\nThis was not the first unofficial visit by a Singaporean leader to Taiwan. Previous\nunofficial visits by even more senior Singapore leaders had passed without incident.\nThe 2004 visit conformed to the established pattern in form and substance of previous\nvisits. But what the 2004 incident had in common with the 2016–17 episode was that\nboth occurred at times of political transition in Singapore.\nIn 2004, it was clear that Lee Hsien Loong would replace Goh Chok Tong as\nSingapore’s third prime minister. By 2016, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had made\npublic his intention to step aside after the next general election (due by 2020) and let\na younger generation of political leaders take over. The pressures deployed on both\noccasions may have been intended as tests of the resolve of new leaders and warnings\nto new leaders about what to expect unless they were more accommodating to China.\nSouth China Sea\nWhen Singapore became the ASEAN country coordinator in 2016, Chinese diplomats\ncalled upon Singapore to “explain” China’s position on the SCS to other ASEAN\ncountries, or to ensure that the issue was not raised in ASEAN forums, or, if raised,\ndownplayed. Such demarches have been routine in all ASEAN countries for many years.\nSimultaneously, messages targeting civil society and other sectors began to appear,\nmost prominently on social media. The aim was to instill a fatalistic acceptance of the\ninevitability and desirability of a Chinese identity for multiracial Singapore and to get\nSingaporeans—and not just Chinese Singaporeans—to pressure the government to\nalign Singapore’s national interests with China’s interests. In essence, they asserted:\n• Unlike Lee Kuan Yew, who had died in 2015, the current Singapore leadership\nunder Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong did not know how to deal with China.\nRelations were so much better then.\n• Singapore has no territorial claims in the SCS, so why was it siding with the\nUnited States against China?\n• Surely, as a “Chinese country,” Singapore should “explain” China’s position to the\nothers or stay neutral.\nIt is difficult to pin down the precise origins of such narratives, but they closely\nresemble arguments made in the Chinese media, in particular the Global Times.\nAppendix 2\n176\nOmitted was the historical fact that Lee Kuan Yew was the only noncommunist\nleader who in the late 1950s and early 1960s went into a CCP-backed United Front\norganization and emerged the victor. That drew a red line, which provided the basis on\nwhich Lee and his successors developed Singapore’s relations with China. Also ignored\nwas the fact that even though Singapore has no territorial claims on the SCS, that does\nnot mean it has no interest there. And, most crucial of all, although the majority of\nSingaporeans are ethnic Chinese, Singapore is a multiracial country organized on the\nbasis of meritocracy and it does not view itself as a mono-racial state like China.\nStill, many Singaporeans, only cursorily interested in international affairs, did\nnot realize they were being fed oversimplifications and swallowed them, or played\nalong for other reasons. Businessmen, academics, and others with interests in China\nwere given broad hints that their interests might suffer unless Singapore was more\naccommodating, and they passed the messages to the Singapore government. The Belt\nand Road Initiative was dangled as bait and the possibility of being excluded loomed\nas a threat, even though Singapore, as a highly developed country, did not need BRI\ninfrastructure. Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping himself had asked Singapore\nto start a BRI-related project in Chongqing. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was\npointedly not invited to the BRI Summit held in Beijing in 2017, although Singapore\nwas represented at a lower level. Appeals to ethnic pride were made to yet others.\nThe operation was effective. The pressures on the government were great. It was\ndifficult to explain the nuances of the SCS issue or Singapore’s relations with China to\nthe general public.\nThen Beijing went too far. In November 2016, nine Singapore armored personnel\ncarriers (APCs) en route home from an overseas military exercise were seized by China\non the flimsiest of excuses. 2 Singaporeans immediately understood that this was naked\nintimidation. Even the leader of the opposition Workers’ Party criticized China in\nParliament. Beijing, by then increasingly concerned with the Trump administration,\ndecided to settle. In January 2017, the APCs were released. The influence apparatus\ngradually stood down and relations returned to normal. Chinese leaders went out of\ntheir way to project friendliness. In late 2017, when news of Prime Minister Lee Hsien\nLoong being invited to the White House by President Trump became public, the prime\nminister was hastily invited to come to Beijing first, where he was received by Xi and\nother senior Chinese leaders.\nAcademia\nMost of the means by which the Chinese narratives were spread in 2016–17 were not\nillegal. However, in August 2017, Huang Jing, an academic born in China who was\nAppendix 2\n177\nteaching at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy\n(LKYSPP), was expelled from Singapore and permanently banned from the country.\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs (responsible for internal security and counterespionage)\nsaid in a statement announcing the expulsion that Huang had been “identified as\nan agent of influence of a foreign country” who had “knowingly interacted with\nintelligence organizations and agents of the foreign country and cooperated with\nthem to influence the Singapore Government’s foreign policy and public opinion in\nSingapore. To this end, he engaged prominent and influential Singaporeans and gave\nthem what he claimed was ‘privileged information’ about the foreign country so as to\ninfluence their opinions in favor of that country. Huang also recruited others in aid of\nhis operations.” 3 The statement went on to say that Huang gave supposedly “privileged\ninformation” to a senior member of the school of public policy in order that it be\nconveyed to the Singapore government. The information was duly conveyed to very\nsenior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore’s foreign policy.\nThe intention, the statement said, was to use the information to cause the Singapore\ngovernment to change its foreign policy. The statement concluded that Huang Jing’s\ncollaboration with foreign intelligence agents was “subversion and foreign interference\nin Singapore’s domestic politics.”\nThe Singapore government has not named the foreign country. In 1988, Singapore had\nexpelled an American diplomat for interference in domestic politics. But it is generally\naccepted that Singapore’s moves in Huang Jing’s case were directed at China.\nImplications for ASEAN\nThere has been no systematic study of Chinese influence operations in ASEAN member\nstates. As a major economy contiguous to Southeast Asia, China will always naturally\nenjoy significant influence even in the absence of such operations. However, anecdotal\nevidence suggests that Singapore’s experience is generally consistent across the region.\nThe differences stem mainly from lax governance standards in other ASEAN member\nstates and their lower level of development. Economic inducements and the greater\ndependence of these countries on Chinese investment, under the general rubric of the\nBelt and Road Initiative, seem to play a more prominent role.\nA common factor is the focus on overseas Chinese communities. Such operations are\nleading China into sensitive territory in Southeast Asia, where the overseas Chinese are\nnot always welcome minorities. China’s navigation of these complexities has in many\ncases been clumsy. Malaysia provides a particularly egregious example that betrays a\nform of cultural and political autism. During the 2018 Malaysian general elections, the\nChinese ambassador to Malaysia openly campaigned for the president of the Malaysian\nChinese Association (MCA) in his constituency. This was a blatant violation of the\nAppendix 2\n178\nprinciple of noninterference enshrined in Article 41 of the Vienna Convention on\nDiplomatic Relations. It exposed beyond the possibility of concealment what China\nreally thinks of noninterference. The MCA president lost his seat.\nThis was not the only instance of insensitive behavior by Chinese diplomats in\nMalaysia. In 2015, the previous Chinese ambassador saw fit to make his way to\nKuala Lumpur’s Chinatown, where only days previously the police had to use water\ncannons to disperse a potentially violent anti-Chinese demonstration. There the\nChinese ambassador delivered a speech that, among other things, pronounced\nthe Chinese government’s opposition to any form of racial discrimination, adding\nfor good measure that it would be a shame if the peace of the area were to be\ndisrupted by the ill-intentioned and that Beijing would not stand idly by if anything\nthreatened the interests of its citizens and Malaysia-China relations.\nUnder other circumstances, these sentiments would perhaps have passed unnoticed.\nBut the timing and context laid the ambassador’s remarks open to disquieting\ninterpretations and drew a protest from the Malaysian government. The PRC foreign\nministry spokesman defended the ambassador’s action as “normal, friendly behavior.”\nUndaunted, in another speech a day later, the Chinese ambassador said, “I would like\nto stress once more, overseas huaqiao and huaren, no matter where you go, no matter\nhow many generations you are, China is forever your warm national home.” 4\nSuch behavior is not atypical in Southeast Asia. If other Chinese diplomats have\nbehaved more prudently in their engagement of overseas Chinese communities in\nother ASEAN countries, it seems a matter of differences between individuals rather\nthan policy. Since such behavior is patently not in China’s interest, China may be\nbeginning to believe its own propaganda. President Xi’s concentration of power and\ninsistence on greater party control seem to have created echo chambers where Chinese\ndiplomats and officials probably report only what is in accordance with preexisting\nbeliefs, resulting in situations where instructions are blindly given and followed.\nThis kind of behavior is not confined to countries where there are large overseas Chinese\ncommunities. Cultural autism or insensitivity is one of the self-created obstacles to the\nsmooth implementation of the BRI that China is experiencing around the world. And as\nthe media report on the problems, awareness spreads. This does not mean that countries\nwill shun working with China. But countries are going to be increasingly cautious. They\nwill push back when the terms of engagement are too onerous and they will seek to forge\nrelationships with as many other major powers as possible.\nFollowing the Malaysian elections, China is projecting friendliness toward Malaysia. But\nas with Singapore, this is a pause, not the end of the story. Since influence operations are\nAppendix 2\n179\nembedded in the intrinsic nature of the Chinese state, they cannot be abandoned unless\nthe nature of the Chinese state fundamentally changes. This is very unlikely.\nNOTES\n1 ​“Singapore Government Statement,” Government of Singapore, May 15, 1971, http://www​. nas​. gov​. sg​\n/ archivesonline​/ data​/ pdfdoc​/ SGPress​_ 3​_ 15​. 5​. 71​. pdf.\n2 ​Jermyn Chow, “SAF Armoured Vehicles Seized in Hong Kong Port, Mindef Expects Shipment to Return\nto Singapore ‘Expeditiously,’ ” Straits Times (Singapore), November 24, 2016, accessed October 11, 2018,\nhttps:// www​. straitstimes​. com​/ asia​/ se​- asia​/ 9​- saf​- armoured​- vehicles​- seized​- at​- hong​- kong​- port.\n3 ​“Cancellation of Singapore Permanent Residence (SPR) Status—Huang Jing and Yang Xiuping,”\nSingapore Ministry of Home Affairs, August 6, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, https:// www​. mha​. gov​. sg​\n/ newsroom​/ press​- release​/ news​/ cancellation​- of​- singapore​- permanent​- residence​-(spr)​- status—huang​- jing​\n- and​- yang​- xiuping.\n4 ​Shannon Teoh and Eunice Au, “KL Wants Chinese Envoy to Explain Remarks,” Straits Times (Singapore),\nOctober 2, 2015, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.straitstimes​.com​/asia​/se​-asia​/kl​-wants​-chinese​\n-envoy​-to​-explain​-remarks.\nUNITED KINGDOM\nUnlike the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, the United Kingdom has had\nno significant all-encompassing debate over Chinese influence operations. When\nthey have occurred, the debates tend to be confined to specific areas such as the\nmedia, academia, or the economy. But so far, no one institute has attempted to bring\nto light the full gamut of Chinese United Front and influence-peddling operations. As\nsuch, Britain’s response to China’s attempts to insinuate itself within Britain’s critical\ninfrastructure, universities, civil society, political system, and think tanks has been\nscattershot at best.\nThe United Kingdom has a complex political, economic, and historical relationship\nwith China, which is a significant trading partner and an increasingly significant\nsource of investment. 1 Especially since the official elevation of UK-China relations to\nGolden Era status in 2014 and the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum, the United\nKingdom has become more open to Chinese influence. 2 Areas of vulnerability\nto improper interference include political and civil society actors as well as the\nmedia. Chinese firms are involved in strategic parts of the British economy, including\ntelecommunications and nuclear power. Improper interference activities can be difficult\nto distinguish from acceptable influence via civil society exchange, public diplomacy,\nand commerce. Problem cases include not only Chinese cyberattacks on political\norganizations and think tanks but also willing collaboration and reluctant complicity.\nA report by GPPi and Merics characterized the most important areas for Chinese\nAppendix 2\n180\ninfluence operations as civil society and the media. 3 But others have noted that\nChina’s leverage over the UK economy is equally, if not more, important.\nPolitics\nSince 2012, the UK governments under prime ministers David Cameron and Theresa\nMay have progressively toned down criticism of China over human rights and Beijing’s\nobligations toward the United Kingdom to respect the Sino-British agreement on Hong\nKong. While this may be in part due to the United Kingdom’s relatively weakening\nposition, these changes have coincided with Chinese efforts to influence British foreign\npolicy.\nInfluence activities by China have included not only apparent attempts to engage\nin cyberattacks on the Scottish Parliament and on think tanks specializing\nin international security issues with connections to government but also reports\nof intimidating messages sent to politicians seen as enemies of China. 4 China has\nalso denied UK politicians, such as members of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs\nCommittee and the deputy chair of the Conservative Party’s Human Rights Commission,\nBen Rogers, access to Hong Kong to investigate human rights issues there. 5\nChina has also acquired influence by offering jobs to former politicians, potentially creating\ndependencies. Former prime minister David Cameron is a case in point. Cameron\ndistanced himself from the Dalai Lama in 2013 and embraced a Golden Era of\nUK-China ties in 2015 while still in office, positioning himself as China’s best friend in\nEurope. 6 Once out of office, Cameron accepted a senior role in the UK-China Fund, a\nmajor infrastructure fund connected with China’s Belt and Road Initiative. 7\nAcademia and Civil Society\nThe Chinese government can exercise influence in the United Kingdom through a\nnumber of mechanisms: repression in China that affects China-related work, such\nas the new Foreign NGO Management Law; remote cybermonitoring; the creation of\nnew institutions it controls; collaborations based on Chinese funding, with strings\nattached; control of Chinese nationals in the United Kingdom; and reporting on or\npressuring domestic institutions and individuals in the United Kingdom. The targets of\nsuch influence activities include the communities these actors serve: students, clients,\nand the wider public.\nChinese scholars and students in the United Kingdom (as of March 2018, some\n170,000) register with the Chinese Students and Scholars Association UK, which\norganizes political education events and is supposed to monitor its members in\naccordance with its “patriotic” mission. 8 Reportedly, students at some universities in\nAppendix 2\n181\nthe United Kingdom have also established Chinese Communist Party cells. 9 The use of\nthe CSSA UK to monitor dissent among Chinese students in the United Kingdom is a\ndirect violation of the principles of the United Kingdom’s democracy.\nInstitutions created or managed by the Chinese authorities include the country’s\ntwenty-nine Hanban-managed Confucius Institutes as well as the new Peking\nUniversity HSBC Business School Oxford Campus—the first overseas campus of a\nChinese university. These institutions have triggered some concerns. They openly\ndiscriminate against certain groups, such as Falun Gong practitioners who are excluded\nfrom employment, as North American cases have shown. 10 Reportedly, agreements\nwith universities that host Confucius Institutes require adherence to Chinese law\naccording to Hanban policies and they are subject to nondisclosure agreements. 11 The\nconcern that these institutions practice (self-)censorship is somewhat mitigated as long\nas the authorship of censored accounts is clear and robust and critical discussion takes\nplace elsewhere in the United Kingdom.\nActivities benefitting from Chinese funding or commercial ties with China are all\nthe more concerning when Chinese influence is less easy to trace. It is impossible\nto tell, for example, if Huawei’s donation to Chatham House’s Asia-Pacific program\nwill affect this venerable institution’s independence and if UK universities’ selfcensorship\non their Chinese campuses will bleed into their home bases. 12 It is clear,\non the other hand, that funding provided to research students and researchers who\ncome to the United Kingdom from China leads to self-censorship. The increased\nrole of the China Scholarship Council, a PRC-funded grant provider, is therefore\nof great concern, as it clearly would not approve projects that might anger China’s\ngovernment. 13 UK-based publishing in China gives rise to concerns about censorship,\nas in the case of Cambridge University Press temporarily censoring the online version\nof its journal China Quarterly in China to accommodate government censorship\nrequests. 14\nChina’s treatment of UK-funded educational institutions in China is also of concern\nin Britain. In June 2018, the University of Nottingham’s campus in Ningbo removed\nits associate provost, Stephen Morgan, after he wrote an online piece criticizing the\nresults of China’s Nineteenth Party Congress. 15 Nottingham has previously given the\nappearance of buckling to Chinese pressure. In 2016, Nottingham abruptly shut its\nSchool of Contemporary Chinese Studies just as students were preparing for exams. The\naction led to the departure of its director, Steve Tsang, a China scholar known for his\nintegrity and independence from Beijing. Sources close to the incident said that PRC\npressure on the university played a direct role in the closure of the institute. Tsang is\nnow the director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and Africa Studies at\nthe University of London.\nAppendix 2\n182\nMedia\nThe UK media have long been important international sources of information and\ninsight on China, reporting independently and critically. While independent reporting\ncontinues, Chinese official media have become more influential in the United Kingdom\nand internationally through their UK presence. Primarily, they have expanded their\noperations and reach. For example, the re-branded China Global Television Network\nEurope Ltd (CGTN), headquartered in London, is seeking to increase activities and\nChina Daily now distributes its China Watch “supplement” as an advertisement inside\nthe respected conservative newspaper the Daily Telegraph. The UK and Chinese\ngovernments have also concluded a Television Co-Production Agreement that provides\na framework under which TV producers in both countries can share resources but have\nto respect “stipulations in the relevant Party’s law and regulations.” 16\nGiven the United Kingdom’s special historical relationship with Hong Kong, the\ncentral authorities’ heavy influence on the Hong Kong media and the deterioration of\nmedia freedom in Hong Kong are of relevance in the United Kingdom, where the case\nof rising self-censorship at the South China Morning Post, for example, has been noted. 17\nAccording to confidential reports, some journalists who have left Hong Kong for the\nUnited Kingdom have encountered intimidation attempts.\nThe effects of media-influencing activities taking place in the United Kingdom are\nhard to assess. Critical reporting continues, but the rise of commercial ventures\ntransporting censorship into the United Kingdom looks set to continue too. For the\nmoment, increasingly difficult access to information and insight in China, as a result\nof domestic repression, is at least as great a problem as attempts to influence or repress\nremotely in the United Kingdom.\nThe Economy\nFor years, the United Kingdom was a bit of an outlier in its openness to Chinese\ninvestment and its willingness to grant Chinese firms, even state-owned ones, access to\nits critical infrastructure. Nonetheless, there is now growing concern in London about\nChina’s ability to leverage its growing economic power into political influence and to\nuse its riches to buy, borrow, or steal key Western technologies that sit at the heart of\nWestern economies.\nIn partnership with France and Germany, the UK government has also introduced\nmechanisms to monitor and block Chinese takeovers of high-technology companies in\nsensitive sectors. 18 The three nations also support efforts to tighten EU-wide regulations\nto govern Chinese investment so that Chinese entities cannot exploit the weaker\nregulatory systems of some European countries to gain access to potentially sensitive\nAppendix 2\n183\ntechnologies. It is unclear how the United Kingdom’s Brexit plan will affect the stated\ndesire of the UK government to ensure that critical technologies do not fall into Chinese\nhands.\nFor years, the Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei has provided broadband gear and\nmobile networks to its clients in Britain, which include British Telecom and Vodafone.\nAnd for years, Huawei executives used their substantial business opportunities in\nBritain as an example to counter allegations in the United States and other Western\ncountries that Huawei was linked to the People’s Liberation Army and therefore a\nsecurity risk. Now it seems that Britain’s government is having second thoughts.\nA government report issued in July 2018 noted that technical and supply-chain\nissues with equipment made by Huawei have exposed Britain’s telecom networks\nto new security risks. 19 Earlier in 2018, Britain’s cybersecurity watchdog warned\ntelecommunications companies against dealing with the Chinese manufacturer\nZTE, citing “potential risks” to national security. 20 ZTE was involved in widespread\nsanctions-busting in deals with Iran and North Korea.\nAnother area of growing concern is nuclear power. China General Nuclear Power\n(GNP)—the main player in China’s nuclear industry—is considering the purchase of a\n49 percent stake in the United Kingdom’s existing nuclear plants. 21 The nuclear power\ngiant has already taken a 33.5 percent stake in the Hinkley Point C power station,\nwhich is being built with French technology. China experts in the United Kingdom\nsuch as Isabel Hilton, the CEO of Chinadialogue​. net, have observed that in opening\nup its vital infrastructure to China, the United Kingdom was without parallel in the\nWestern world. “No other OECD country has done this. This is strategic infrastructure,\nand China is a partner but not an ally in the security sense. . . . ​You are making a 50-year\nbet, not only that there will be no dispute between the UK and China but also no\ndispute between China and one of the UK’s allies. It makes no strategic sense.” 22\nResponses to Interference Activities\nIn addition to some limited pushback on Chinese economic moves, there are signs\nthat the United Kingdom is slowly understanding the challenge presented by Chinese\ninfluence activities. UK media have continued to report pressure on journalists, the\nmedia, civil society, and those involved in politics. This reporting has been somewhat\neffective in correcting perceptions of the nature and functioning of Chinese governance.\nThe media have also focused attention on how China monitors and obstructs the work\nof foreign reporters in China.\nThe political system has also begun to respond to some influence activities. At the\ndomestic level, a parliamentary inquiry on the United Kingdom’s relations with China,\nAppendix 2\n184\nlaunched in 2015 and relaunched in 2017, has sought input on some of the issues\ndiscussed here. 23 A newly launched NGO, Hong Kong Watch, focuses on drawing\nattention to the United Kingdom’s special responsibility toward Hong Kong. The\nConservative Party Human Rights Commission has produced its own report on the\ndeteriorating human rights situation in both China and Hong Kong and has organized\ninquiries and events on topics such as the United Kingdom’s Confucius Institutes. 24\nWhile the Foreign and Commonwealth Office presents the relationship with China\nas primarily collaborative, it is also conducting research on Chinese influence and\ninterference activities. 25 At the international level, the United Kingdom has joined\nseveral open letters to signal its position on China’s violations of human rights. 26\nCivil society has also sought to raise the Foreign NGO Management Law as well as\nto highlight intensified repression. By contrast, responses from academic institutions\nhave so far been sporadic. For example, in 2011, the University of Cambridge\ndisaffiliated CSSA Cambridge due to its undemocratic organization. 27 In 2017,\ninternational academics joined together to convince the Cambridge University Press\nto stop censoring its publications available in China. 28 Still, despite experiencing such\ninfluence campaigns in the past, such as with Libya, which was spelled out in the\n2011 Woolf Inquiry, there seems to have been no coherent initiative on protecting\nacademic freedom and maintaining wider ethical standards in the face of these types\nof campaigns. 29\nNOTES\n1 ​$9.6 billion in the United Kingdom according to Godement and Vasselier, “China at the Gates.”\n2 ​“New Phase in Golden Era for UK-China Relations,” Government of the United Kingdom, December 15,\n2017, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.gov​.uk​/government​/news​/new​-phase​-in​-golden​-era​-for​-uk​\n- china​- relations.\n3 ​Benner et al., “Authoritarian Advance.”\n4 ​Paul Hutcheon, “China Accused of Being Behind Recent Cyber Attack on Scottish Parliament,” Herald\n(Scotland), September 16, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, http://www​.heraldscotland​.com​/news​\n/15540166​.China​_accused​_of​_being​_behind​_recent​_cyber​_attack​_on​_Scottish​_Parliament;

CCTV channels (English and Chinese) are in the cable systems of\nall the major metropolitan areas of the United States.\n• The major official Chinese TV networks, including CCTV and major Chinese\nprovincial TV networks, and the quasi-official Phoenix TV, are all in the\nprogram lineups of Chinese TV streaming services that have become popular\namong Chinese communities in the United States. There are four major Chinese\nstreaming services in the United States: iTalkBB Chinese TV ( 蜻蜓電視 ), Charming\nChina ( 魅力中國 ), Great Wall ( 長城平台 ), and KyLin TV ( 麒麟電視 ). All these services\ncarry the major official Chinese TV channels, including major provincial\nchannels, and are accessible nationwide.\n• The major official Chinese media organizations, CCTV (CGTN), Xinhua, the\nPeople’s Daily, and China Daily (the only major official newspaper in English),\nhave a heavy presence on all major social media platforms of the United States\nand have many followers. All these outlets use Facebook and Twitter and other\nplatforms, even though those platforms are blocked in China.\n• Quasi-official Phoenix TV ( 鳳凰衛視 ), a global TV network with links to the PRC’s\nMinistry of State Security and headquartered in Hong Kong with branches around\nthe world, including the United States, also has a substantial presence on all the\nmajor social media platforms in the United States.\n188\nChinese media social media presence\n(E) = English version; (C) = Chinese version\nPlatform Official Organizations and Subscribers/Followers Quasi-official\nCCTV (CGTN) Xinhua People’s\nDaily\nChina\nDaily\nTwitter CCTV: 532K (E+C) 11.8M (E) 4.54M (E) 1.8M (E) 7K (C)\nCGTN: 7.19M (E) 11.6M (C) 221K (C)\nFacebook CCTV: 48.04M (E);\n46.92M (E) 43.15M (E) 35.17M (E) 14K (C)\n3.44M (C)\n171K (C)\nCGTN: 58.28M (E)\nCGTN America: 1.2M (E)\nYouTube 289K (C) 173K (E) 25K (E) 3K (E) 75K (C)\nInstagram 550K (E) 111K (E) 696K (E) 23.5K (E) N/A\nPhoenix TV (fully\ncontrolled by Chinese\ngovernment)\nPRC-Funded and PRC-Controlled Media Outlets\nThe Chinese Communist Party liaises with Chinese-language media mainly through\nthe Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council (or Qiao Ban 侨办 ). The Qiao\nBan holds an annual conference on Chinese-language media called the World Chinese\nMedia Forum. These media outlets are registered in the United States by US citizens\nor permanent residents, but they might actually be owned by Chinese state-run\ncompanies.\nThe Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council of PRC ( 中國國務院僑務辦公室 )\nappears to directly control the Asian Culture and Media Group ( 美國亞洲文化傳媒集團 )\nin America, which has three media subsidiaries: SinoVision ( 美國中文電視 ), the China\nPress (Qiaobao or 僑報 ), and the Sino American Times ( 美洲时报 ). Sky Link TV ( 天下衛視 )\nis another media outlet in the United States. Unlike SinoVision and Qiaobao, it is fully\nowned by Guangzhou Media American Co, Ltd. ( 美國廣視傳媒有限公司 ), which in turn\nis owned by GZ Television Media ( 广州影视传媒有限公司 ), a Chinese state-owned media\noutlet.\nSinoVision\nThe group’s main TV outlet is SinoVision. It operates two twenty-four-hour channels\n(one Chinese and one English), and it is on the program lineups of cable systems Time\nWarner Cable-73, Verizon FiOS-26, Cablevision-73, and RCN-80, covering about thirty\nmillion people. Sinovision’s website ( 美国中文电视 , ht t p : //w w w​.s i n o v i s i o n ​.n e t ) r a n k s\nAppendix 3\n189\ntwelfth among all the Chinese websites in the United States. Its reporting hews closely\nto China’s official media:\n• Example 1: On June 27, 2017, the US Department of State, in its annual Trafficking\nin Persons Report 2017, put China at Tier 3, the lowest class. In reporting this\nnews, SinovisionNet simply reposted comments from the official website of the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of China attacking the human rights record of the\nUnited States. 1\n• Example 2: In March 2017, the US State Department published its 2016 Human\nRights Report. SinovisionNet published two stories on this topic. One reported\nthe reaction to the story by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The other story\ncame from Xinhua, which was highly critical of the US human rights situation.\nSinovisionNet also published two reports by the Information Office of the State\nCouncil of China on America’s human rights record. It did not publish State\nDepartment’s human rights report. 2\n• Example 3: On the tensions in the South China Sea, almost all the stories posted\non SinovisionNet are from official Chinese media outlets and websites. They are\nnaturally critical of US actions in that area. 3\nQiaobao and the Sino American Times\nQiaobao, or the China Press ( 僑報 , http:// www​. uschinapress​. com), is the flagship\npro-PRC newspaper published in the United States. Its website ranks forty-first among\nall the Chinese websites in the United States. Qiaobao was established in 1990. It is\nheadquartered in New York City with branches in twelve major metropolitan areas of\nthe United States. The Sino American Times ( 美洲时报 ) is a free paper and not a major\nmedia presence in the United States.\nIndependent Media\nOver the course of the last decade, most of the independent Chinese-language media\noutlets in the United States have been taken over by businessmen sympathetic to the\nPRC.\n• Wenxuecheng ( 文学城 , wenxuecheng​. com) is the most popular Chinese-language\nwebsite in the United States. In 2003, it was purchased by a Taiwanese American\nAppendix 3\n190\nbusinessman with business interests in China. There is an unsubstantiated\nrumor that the investment was subsidized by $1 million from the Ministry of\nPropaganda.\n• Duowei is another online source that was for years an independent Chineselanguage\nmedia. It was purchased in 2009 by a pro-PRC Hong Kong businessman.\n• Mingjing, or Mirror Media, a Chinese-language web presence based in Canada,\nwas once considered independent of Beijing’s control but has modified its\nreporting in recent years.\n• Backchina​. com, ( 倍可亲 , ranked as the fifth most popular Chinese website in\nthe United States), was once a staunch critic of China like Duowei. But in 2017\nits editors attended the ninth World Chinese Media Forum in China and its\nreporting became far more positive about the PRC.\n• Sing Tao Newspaper Group was established in Hong Kong in 1938. In 2001, it\nwas purchased by a pro-Beijing businessman.\n• The World Journal ( 世界日报 ) was for years the premier Chinese-language paper in\nthe United States. It, too, has softened its stance on the PRC in recent years.\n• Ming Pao served the Hong Kong-immigrant community. It is another formerly\nindependent newspaper that has fallen under Beijing’s control.\n• Boxun is a Chinese-language news site whose servers are located in North\nCarolina. It was founded by an immigrant from China. Its news is highly\nunreliable.\n• The Epoch Times ( 大纪元 ), the Hope Radio, and New Tang Dynasty TV, remain\nindependent of PRC control. They are either owned or operated by adherents\nto the Falun Gong sect, which is banned in China. Their reporting on China\nis uneven.\n• Vision Times (secretchina​. com) was founded in 2001 as a website, secretchina​\n. com, and began publishing a free weekly newspaper in 2005.\nAppendix 3\n191\nNOTES\n1 ​“ 美国务院欲将中国人权状况调为最差等级外交部回应 .” Sinovision.

The\nreport discusses a very broad range of Chinese activities, only some of which constitute\ncoercive, covert, or corrupt interference in American society and none of which actually\nundermines our democratic political institutions. Not distinguishing the legitimate from\nthe illegitimate activities detracts from the credibility of the report. The cumulative effect\nof this expansive inventory that blurs together legitimate with illegitimate activities is to\noverstate the threat that China today poses to the American way of life. Especially during\nthis moment in American political history, overstating the threat of subversion from\nChina risks causing overreactions reminiscent of the Cold War with the Soviet Union,\nincluding an anti-Chinese version of the Red Scare that would put all ethnic Chinese under\na cloud of suspicion. Right now, I believe the harm we could cause our society by our own\noverreactions actually is greater than that caused by Chinese influence seeking. That is why\nI feel I must dissent from the overall threat assessment of the report.\n194\nDissenting Opinion\nAfterword\nORVILLE SCHELL AND LARRY DIAMOND\nWhat makes this report timely and important is China’s increasingly forward and aggressive\nposture on the global stage. Once largely a form of economic competition, China’s recent\nturn to military and political rivalry with the United States has changed the whole\nequation of the bilateral relationship. If the United States is to fare well in this increasingly\nadversarial competition, Americans must have a far better sense than they now do about\nboth the nature of the system and values that underlay the People’s Republic of China and\nthe challenges Beijing’s ambitious agenda of multi-faceted outreach is beginning to pose\nfor our country—especially our media, universities, think tanks, and other civil society\ninstitutions that make our society so unique, vibrant, and strong.\nHowever, at the same time that we fortify ourselves against harmful outside interference,\nwe must also be mindful to do no harm. In particular, we must guard against having this\nreport used unfairly to cast aspersions on Chinese, whether Chinese American immigrants\nwho have become (or are becoming) United States citizens, Chinese students, Chinese\nbusinesspeople, or other kinds of Chinese visitors, whose contributions to America’s\nprogress over the past century have been enormous.\nJust because the Chinese Communist Party presumes that all ethnic Chinese (wherever\nthey may reside) still owe some measure of loyalty “to the Chinese motherland,” zuguo\n( 祖国 ), does not mean that they are collectively in possession of compromised loyalty to\ntheir adopted home or place of study. Our Working Group’s findings do suggest that the\nleadership of the PRC has stepped up a new and well funded campaign of influence seeking\nin the United States. However, this should not be viewed as an invitation to a McCarthy eralike\nreaction against Chinese in America. Rather, it is a summons to greater awareness of the\nchallenges our country faces and greater vigilance in defending our institutions.\nIn helping to convene this Working Group on Chinese influence seeking in the United\nStates (and elsewhere in the world), the intention of the Task Force on US-China relations\nhas been to limit the growing PRC challenge to American institutions and values, which\nis being played according to rules that are increasingly lacking in reciprocity. Developing\nstrategies to counteract and protect our society when influence seeking becomes\ninterference is the charge of this report, and perhaps the most effective defense is to\nstrengthen our own democratic values and institutions. But at the same time we would be\nnaïve not to want to become more familiar with the full dimensions of Beijing’s overseas\nambitions, the state organs, and the resources now dedicated to “overseas propaganda,”\n196\nwaixuan ( 外宣 ), and the less than transparent manner in which Chinese influence seeking is\noften carried out.\nWe reiterate: it is absolutely crucial that whatever measures are taken to counteract harmful\nforms of Chinese influence seeking not end up demonizing any group of Americans, or\neven visitors to America, in ways that are unfair or reckless.\nAfterword\nAbout the Participants\nRobert Daly is Director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the\nWoodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\nLarry Diamond is Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and at the Freeman Spogli\nInstitute for International Studies at Stanford University.\nElizabeth Economy is the C.V.
