This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\nBullish equities 2017; rotation into cyclicals, banks, insurance\nWe are bullish Japan equities for 2017 and we estimate the Nikkei 225 index will recover\nto 20,000 by end-2017 (see $/¥’s eventual surge: Buy Nikkei 06 September 2016). Our\nnew Chief Japan Economist Izumi Devalier forecasts above-consensus Japan GDP growth\nand inflation in 2017, which is also supportive of our bullish equities scenario (see Ready\nfor ignition 18 November 2016). We expect rotation into cyclicals, banks and insurance\nas explained below.\n1) Upturn in inventory cycle: Defensives→Cyclicals\nWe expect cyclicals to outperform defensives, premised on our end-2017 $/¥ estimate\nof ¥120, and this is supported by our above-consensus economic growth outlook. Our\nJapan economist sees a shift to fiscal easing, firms countering the tight labor market by\nincreasing capex, and estimates industrial production to grow 3.5% and 3.6% in 2017\nand 2018, respectively. With the inventory cycle exiting a “contraction” phase and\nentering a “recovery” phase, conditions are likely to remain conducive to cyclicals\noutperforming defensives (Chart 1, Exhibit 3).\n2) Higher inflation, rates: Deflation stocks→Inflation stocks\nUp to 1H16, the Japan equity market saw continued preference for deflationary stocks\nas domestic inflation remained subdued and the JGB curve underwent excessive bull\nflattening. Defensives outperformed cyclicals (Chart 1), growth outperformed value\n(Chart 2), and stocks that benefit from a low-yield environment (REITs) outperformed\nthe converse (banks, insurance; Chart 3). However, we expect conditions to reverse into\n2017. We see US Treasury yields rising and Japanese core CPI inflation recovering to\n+1.4% yoy by 2018 and core-core to +1.1% yoy. Stronger inflation and higher foreign\nyields should steepen the JGB yield curve above10yr, while below 10yr should escape\nfrom downward pressure as BoJ rate cut expectations recede. Against this backdrop, we\nexpect to see a rotation from deflation to inflation stocks, which in addition to cyclicals\nmeans banks and insurance should outperform REITs within the financial sector (Chart 3).\nThis is also in line with the global rotation expected by Michael Hartnett (The Flow\nShow: The Inflation Era Begins 10 November 2016).\n3) Nikkei winner of steeper UST and strong macro\nIn a scenario of strong external demand and US rate hikes (particularly with curve\nsteepening), Japan equities tend to be the winner on a local currency basis, led by\ncyclicals, banks and insurance stocks (Exhibit 4). Resurgence in the “Japan macro trade”\nof short yen / buy equities is also a possibility.\nOur Buy-rated stocks in bank, insurance and cyclical sectors are listed in Table 1.\n>> Employed by a non-US affiliate of MLPF&S and is not registered/qualified as a research analyst under\nthe FINRA rules.\nRefer to \"Other Important Disclosures\" for information on certain BofA Merrill Lynch entities that take\nresponsibility for this report in particular jurisdictions.\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.

The likelihood of\nagreement on the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) has already declined and been priced\ninto the market, but any downward spiral in Japan-US relations would likely be further\nnegative for Japan equities near-term. A rise in protectionism would be negative for\nstocks with high US export exposure. Meanwhile if the US economy slows or enters\nrecession and the protectionist response weakens USD, it would be negative for\nJapanese cyclicals, particularly exporters, due to stronger JPY and potential trade\nconflicts. Moreover, a potential improvement in US-Russia (US-China) relations under\nthe new US President most likely implies a relative worsening in Japan-Russia (Japan-\nChina) relations. On the other hand, we expect Japan to move closer to Europe under\nsuch a scenario, raising the incentive to sign the Japan-EU EPA (Economic Partner\nAgreement), positive for related stocks. If the Trump presidency tips the US towards\nisolationism, we expect Japan’s spending on defense to increase. If this results in higher\nspending on Japan’s Self Defense Forces (rather than compensating for US spending on\nJapan-based US military), Japan’s defense-related stocks would be beneficiaries, and it\ncould reshape the arms industry in Japan.\nChart 1: Sector rotation and inventory cycle\n130.0\n40\n125.0\n120.0\n30\n115.0\n20\n110.0\n10\n105.0\n100.0\n0\n95.0\n-10\n90.0\n85.0 Cyclical Fundamental Defensive Cyclical Fundamental Defensive\n-20\nCyclical\n80.0\n-30\nJan-09 Jan-11 Jan-13 Jan-15\nIndustrial production - inventory (3m mva yoy%)\nMSCI Japan cyclical/defensive\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Haver\nCyclical = Industrials, consumer discretionary, IT, materials\nDefensive = Healthcare, telecom, consumer staples, utilities\nCalculated cyclical and defensive % change using monthly index return and index weight\nChart 2: Japan – High Beta PB vs. Low Beta PB\nHigh Beta PB / Low Beta PB\n2.0\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Quantitative Strategy, MSCI, IBES\nGlobal Quant Panorama: Surf for longer 14 November 2016\n2 Japan Investment Strategy | 18 November 2016\nExhibit 3: Sector rotation and inventory cycle\nSlowdown\nInventory\nExpansion\n8\nDefensives\n6\nJune '12\nJune '15 4\n2\nJune '14\nFundamentals\nProduction\n0\n(8) (6) (4) (2) 0 2 4 6 8 10\n(2)\nSep '16\nJune '13 (4)\nChart 3: Higher inflation/yields suggests banks will outperform REITs\n2.3\n2.1\n1.9\n1.7\n1.5\n1.3\n1.1\n0.9\n0.7\n0.5\nContraction\nCyclicals\n(6)\nRecovery\nTSE Bank/ TSE REIT\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg,\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Haver\nExhibit 4: Reactions to US Treasury curve moves (%, simple average of past 43 quarters) – Japan equities have outperformed during bear-steepening led by\ncyclicals, banks and insurance\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-8\n-10\n-12\nUSDJPY DXY MSCI JP MSCI JP /\nex JP\nJapan Sector = cyclical outperform on\nUST bear-steepening\nDiscretionary Financials Materials IT Industrials Energy Telecom Staples Utilities Health care\nBear steep Bear flat Bull steep Bull flat\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg.\nCurve movements based on 2yr move and 2s10s move (Bloomberg US Treasury yield index), so includes twist movements, but even if we exclude these implications do not materially change.\nBear steepening (2yr + 16bps, 2s10s +33bps) = 11 quarters, bear flattening (2yr +26bps, 2s10s -20bps) = 10 quarters, bull steepening (2yr -48bps, 2s10s +28bps) = 10 quarters, bull flattening (2yr -27bps, 2s10s -30bps) =\n12 quarters\nJapan Investment Strategy | 18 November 2016 3\nTable 1: Shares rated buy by our analysts in cyclical, bank and insurance sectors*\nCompany Name Ticker Industry (JPX definition) Price\nMKT CAP\n(Billion Yen)\nAnalyst Name\nMitsubishi UFJ FG 8306 JP Banks 683 9,674 Futoshi Sasaki\nJapan Post Bank 7182 JP Banks 1331 5,990 Futoshi Sasaki\nSMFG 8316 JP Banks 4190 5,925 Futoshi Sasaki\nResona HD 8308 JP Banks 538 1,251 Futoshi Sasaki\nMitsubishi Elec 6503 JP Electric Appliances 1592 3,418 Mikio Hirakawa\nNidec 6594 JP Electric Appliances 10460 3,035 Masashi Kubota\nHitachi 6501 JP Electric Appliances 588 2,658 Mikio Hirakawa\nPanasonic 6752 JP Electric Appliances 1033 2,533 Mikio Hirakawa\nDai-ichi Life 8750 JP Insurance 1850 2,202 Futoshi Sasaki\nMS&AD Holdings 8725 JP Insurance 3405 2,085 Futoshi Sasaki\nSompo Holdings 8630 JP Insurance 3684 1,506 Futoshi Sasaki\nShin-Etsu Chem 4063 JP Chemicals 8328 3,599 Takashi Enomoto\nFUJIFILM 4901 JP Chemicals 4095 1,906 Hiroyasu Eguchi\nSony 6758 JP Electric Appliances 3226 4,075 Mikio Hirakawa\nNTT DATA 9613 JP Information & Communication 5530 1,551 Hiroyasu Eguchi\nNSSMC 5401 JP Iron & Steel 2384 2,266 Takashi Enomoto\nJR East 9020 JP Land Transportation 9542 3,743 Yasuhito Tsuchiya\nJR Central 9022 JP Land Transportation 17825 3,672 Yasuhito Tsuchiya\nNintendo 7974 JP Other Products 26050 3,129 Hiroyasu Eguchi\nRecruit HD 6098 JP Services 4340 2,453 Yoshiyuki Kinoshita\nOriental Land 4661 JP Services 5957 1,991 Rie Sakai\nFuji Heavy Ind 7270 JP Transportation Equipment 4320 3,371 Kei Nihonyanagi\nSuzuki Motor 7269 JP Transportation Equipment 3711 1,637 Kei Nihonyanagi\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n*Cyclical sectors = Industrials, consumer discretionary, IT, materials in GICS definition\n*Market cap above 1.5trn JPY except bank, insurance shares\n*Exclude Fast Retailing\n4 Japan Investment Strategy | 18 November 2016\nDisclosures\nImportant Disclosures\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%\nNeutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%\nUnderperform N/A ≥ 20%\n* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s).
