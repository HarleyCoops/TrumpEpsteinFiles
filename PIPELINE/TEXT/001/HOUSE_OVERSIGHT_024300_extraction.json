I asked \nher to leave, and she wouldn't. And I said, 'I'm going to call the police if you don't,' and I \nwent to call the police and she left,\" Cooke said. \"And that's the end of the story.\" \nBannon grew up in Richmond, the newspaper noted. \nThe Richmond Police Department confirmed the call was made but the call was canceled \nbefore officers responded. \n\"We are a bookshop. Bookshops are all about ideas and tolerating different opinions and not \nabout verbally assaulting somebody, which is what was happening,\" Cooke said. \nSponsored Content \n1-1124-\nTrump's Supreme Court shortlist \nBy The Hill \nRead More \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024300 \nBannon joins a growing list of political figures associated with President Trump who have \nbeen confronted in public in recent weeks. \nProtesters in Kentucky followed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to his \ncar while he was leaving a Louisville restaurant on Saturday, threatening to vote him out of \noffice.  \nOthers, including White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Department of \nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, also have been confronted by protesters for \ntheir association with the Trump administration and its policies. \nRichard Kahn \nHBRK Associates Inc. \n575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor \nNew York, NY 10022 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024301 \n"
