THOMAS —Wealthy sex o!ender Je!rey Epstein has been\nquietly working for years to construct a new compound on\nGreat St. James island o! the East End of St. Thomas, adding\nto a massive real estate portfolio that also includes\nneighboring Little St. James island, which has been his\nprimary residence for decades.\nJe!rey Epstein\nHOGP\nV.I. Department of Planning and Natural Resources\nspokesman Jamal Nielsen confirmed Monday that at least\nsome of that construction activity has been taking place\nwithout permission from the government — the third time\nin as many years that Epstein has gone beyond the scope of\npermitted building plans.\n“We have confirmed that there’s unauthorized work going on\nat Great St. James, we have been in touch with the owners\nand we are setting up to have a meeting with them soon, to\nrectify this,” Nielsen said.\nhttp://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/epstein-building-compoun…n-great-st-james/article_a49261e9-40f0-57b1-9501-605e26e74cf3.html\nPage 1 of 4\nEpstein building compound on Great St. James | News | virginislandsdailynews.com\n5/7/19, 9(15 AM\nNielsen could not say what specifically the unauthorized\nwork consists of, but said DPNR Commissioner nominee\nJean-Pierre Oriol would be available by phone today to\nanswer questions about the situation.\nDocuments on file at the Coastal Zone Management division\nof DPNR show that Epstein used “Great St. Jim, LLC,” a shell\ncompany organized by St. Thomas attorney Erika Kellerhals,\nto purchase three parcels totaling 80.1 acres from the Danish\nKjaer family for $17.5 million on Jan. 18, 2016.\nThe remainder of the island — 12 parcels totaling 81.22 acres\n— was transferred from another St. Thomas company, GSJ\nProperties Corp., to Great St. Jim LLC for $5 million on Jan.\n21, 2016.\nWhile it’s long been rumored that Epstein had purchased\nGreat St. James, for years his name appeared nowhere on\npublicly available documents listing property ownership of\nthe island.\nThe Daily News requested access to documents contained in\nCoastal Zone Management permit application files for the\nisland on April 18, and was provided access to those records\nMonday.\nThe documents show that in 2011, Kellerhals, another\nattorney in her firm, Gregory Ferguson, and business\nconsultant Brett Geary organized the St. Thomas company\nPoplar Inc.\nA certificate of incumbency contained in the file lists Epstein\nas president of Poplar Inc., his longtime lawyer Darren\nIndyke is listed as vice president and secretary, and another\nlongtime associate, Richard Kahn, is listed as treasurer.\nThe Daily Beast reported in April that Kellerhals, Indyke, and\nKahn are listed as the only o\"cers of other defunct\nnonprofits run by Epstein, including the C.O.U.Q.\nFoundation, J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, and Epstein\nInterests. They’re also listed as o\"cers for Gratitude America\nLtd., a nonprofit formed in the Virgin Islands in 2012 through\nwhich Epstein has made financial contributions to various\norganizations.\nThe certificate specifically states that those individuals are\nauthorized to act on behalf of the corporation with respect to\nall transactions, “including but not limited to transactions\nrelated to permitting matters submitted on behalf of Great\nSt. Jim, LLC.”\nhttp://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/epstein-building-compoun…n-great-st-james/article_a49261e9-40f0-57b1-9501-605e26e74cf3.html\nPage 2 of 4\nEpstein building compound on Great St. James | News | virginislandsdailynews.com\n5/7/19, 9(15 AM\nKellerhals organized Great St. Jim LLC on Oct. 26, 2015, with\nherself as the sole member, and identified Geary’s company,\nBusiness Basics VI LLC, as the resident agent.\nKellerhals could not be reached for comment Monday.\nDocuments contained in the permit application file show\nthat DPNR employees and Epstein’s sta! have been\ncommunicating for years about the project.\n“[H]i Erika, spoke with Je! yesterday and let him know that\nthe scopes of work from both applications are being\ncombined into one single permit. Dave of my sta! is\nsupposed to reach out to the LSJ [Little St. James] sta! and\narrange when he can make the required site visit. there are\nsome specific details that were not included in the\napplication package, so they will have to be verified during\nthe site visit and notes made on the submitted drawings,”\nOriol wrote to Kellerhals in an email dated Aug. 16, 2016,\nunder the subject line, “RE: Cistern Permit.”\nAn email from DPNR legal counsel Michele Baker to\nKellerhals dated Aug. 26, 2016, lists a number of documents\nrequired for the permit application to proceed, and indicates\nthat “the OWNER” has to sign o!.\nKellerhals responded in an email that “I understand that\nthere are some places where the owner needs to sign if the\nattorney completes the application. I will discuss with Je!rey\nand get you copies of those signed attachments asap. You are\ncorrect that I am no longer the sole member. In fact, I am not\na member at all. The only position I serve is as counsel to\nGreat St. Jim.”\nEpstein signed o! on the application for a Coastal Zone\nManagement major permit on Jan. 10, 2017, identifying\nhimself as “President of Poplar, Inc., sole member of Great\nSt. Jim, LLC.”\nPermit application documents and site plans on file show\nthat Epstein is planning a complex of buildings across the\napproximately 160-acre island, connected by private road.\nThe plans include a barge dock, two homes, cottages, an\namphitheater, gardens, a marine electrical cable, solar array\nand generator, storage building, security building, workshed\nand machine shop, and an “underwater o\"ce & pool.”\nThe permit application addresses mitigation e!orts for\nendangered corals and the Virgin Islands tree boa — which\nwas spotted on the island during site visits — and indicates\nhttp://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/epstein-building-compoun…n-great-st-james/article_a49261e9-40f0-57b1-9501-605e26e74cf3.html\nPage 3 of 4\nEpstein building compound on Great St. James | News | virginislandsdailynews.com\n5/7/19, 9(15 AM\nthat the public will still have free access to the island’s\nshoreline, which includes Christmas Cove, a popular boating\nsite and home to floating restaurant Pizza Pi.\nA wealthy financier long associated with the rich and\npowerful, including former President Bill Clinton and\nPresident Donald Trump, Epstein, 66, was convicted in 2008\nof procuring a child under the age of 18 for prostitution.\nAn investigation by the Miami Herald found that despite\nevidence Epstein sexually abused dozens of underage girls,\nsome who say they were forced to have sex with Epstein’s\nrich friends at his various homes, including on Little St.\nJames, federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta — who now\nserves as U.S. secretary of labor — worked with Epstein’s\ndefense attorneys to craft an extraordinarily lenient plea\ndeal.\nA federal judge ruled in February that Miami prosecutors\nviolated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act when they\nintentionally kept that agreement secret from victims in the\ncase.\nWhile Epstein owns lavish properties in New York City, Palm\nBeach, and New Mexico that he travels between on his private\nBoeing 727, he lists Little St. James as his primary residence\non his sex o!ender registration.\nEpstein last verified his registration with the V.I. Justice\nDepartment on March 15, which lists the 11 vehicles he owns\n— all of which are black — including a Mercedes-Benz S550,\nBentley Arnage, Hummer II, Dodge Caravan, Range Rover,\nthree Chevy Suburbans and three Cadillac Escalades.\n— Contact Suzanne Carlson at 340-714-9122 or email\nscarlson@dailynews.vi.\nSuzanne Carlson\nhttp://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/epstein-building-compoun…n-great-st-james/article_a49261e9-40f0-57b1-9501-605e26e74cf3.html\nPage 4 of 4\n"
