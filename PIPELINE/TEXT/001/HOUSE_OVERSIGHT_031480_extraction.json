Turkey in May officially designated Mr. Gulen's network a terrorist organization, making \nmembership a crime under Turkish law. \nMr. Erdogan's government has pressed the Obama administration since the coup to extradite Mr. Gulen, \narguing that pursuing the imam is part of the broader campaign against terrorism. At times, the Turkish leader's \naides have said Ankara would view as hostile any foreign government that gave sanctuary to leaders of the \nGulen movement. \nTurkey hasn't yet made a formal extradition request to the U.S., and Turkish officials say they plan to provide \nmore evidence to the Justice Department. \nMr. Gulen, 75 years old, came to the U.S. in 1999, and has a devoted following in Turkey and other countries. \nAt a press conference in Washington on Friday, Mr. Gulen's lawyers said they have spoken to the Justice \nDepartment about the demands for extradition but are unaware of the U.S. government's thinking or plans. \nAsked if they feared for his life, one of Mr. Gulen's lawyers, Reid Weingarten said, \"We do. We're very \nconcerned about his safety.\" The lawyer said they are discussing whether to ask U.S. authorities for help in \nsafeguarding their client. \nA Turkish court has issued a warrant for Mr. Gulen's arrest, and Turkish and U.S. authorities have privately \ndiscussed scenarios in which Mr. Gulen might be extradited. But several U.S. officials said they cannot now \nenvision a scenario in which they turn him over to Turkey. \n\"It would be unprecedented and appalling if the U.S. took a frail, almost octogenarian, plopped him on a plane \nto go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him by the entire Turkish \ngovernment,\" said Mr. Weingarten. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031481 \n\"The bluster, the conspiracy theories, and the threats of Mr. Erdogan are not strong enough to overwhelm the \nAmerican legal system,\" he added. \"And for that reason we believe that Mr. Gulen should not and will not be \nextradited.\" \nMr. Weingarten said the chances that his client helped plot a coup from his base in the Poconos is \"about as \nlikely\" as a meteor striking the lawyer's office while he was speaking. \nWrite to Devlin Barrett at devlin.barrett@wsj.com  \nFrom: Keough, Michael \nSent: Friday, August 05, 2016 1:28 PM \nTo: Will Bohlen (IMM \n>; Katelyn Wohlford \n>; Weingarten, Reid \n>; King, Ka \nWeinstein, Jason Osman Oz. \n•_>; Erin Billings <________________ \nCc: Eliopoulos, Steven < \nSubject: RE: Audio recording \nthryn <==>; Miller, Michael \n>; Y.

It has called on the US to \nextradite him. \nMr Gulen denies any involvement. \nTurkey has cracked down heavily in the wake of the coup attempt. On Friday the governing AK Party ordered an internal purge \nof Gulen supporters. \nMore than 270 people died in events surrounding the coup attempt. \nSpeaking at a news conference in Washington, Mr Gulen's lawyers said they expected him to remain at the Pennsylvania \ncompound where he lives in self-imposed exile, and not attempt to flee. \nMr Gulen is a reclusive figure who rarely makes contact with the media. \nAlthough Turkey has demanded his extradition, it has yet to make a formal request. \nThe US has said its judiciary will consider a request if and when it is filed. It also asked for evidence of the cleric's involvement \nin the coup attempt, which Turkey says it has supplied. \nMr Gulen's lawyers said it was most unlikely any extradition request would stand up in a US court and almost no chance that \ntheir client would get a fair trial in Turkey, given what had been said against him there since the coup attempt. \nOne of the lawyers, Reid Weingarten, said: \"It would be unprecedented and appalling if the United States took a frail almost-\noctogenarian, plopped him on a plane to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him \nby the entire Turkish government.\" \nMuch of Turkey's crackdown has targeted perceived supporters of the cleric. \nTens of thousands of public sector workers have been suspended or dismissed, with many having their passports cancelled. \nThere has also been a massive reshuffle of the military. \nAbout 18,000 people have been detained or arrested. \nNow local branches of the AK Party have been told to begin a purge of suspected Gulenists in their ranks. \nMr Gulen had been a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan until a bitter split between his movement and the party of \nthe president three years ago. \nTurkey has listed Mr Gulen's movement as a terrorist organisation. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031483 \nFrom: Will Bohlen \nSent: Friday, August 05, 2016 1:19 PM \nTo: 'Keough, Michael' <; King, Kathryn <>; Miller, Michael \n>; Katelyn Wohlford Y.

The U.S. government has not done so, and \nthe dispute has raised questions about relations between the two allies. \nTurkey, a member of the NATO alliance, hosts American troops and \nwarplanes at Incirlik Air Base, an important staging area for the U.S.-\nled fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \nAt a news conference in Washington, Weingarten and Michael Miller, \nanother Steptoe attorney, said evidence from a 2015 case financed by \nthe Turkish government against Gulen in U.S. federal court in \nPennsylvania showed that the Turkish government relies on dubious \nproof to make its case against him. \nThat case alleged Gulen issued coded orders to followers in the \nTurkish judiciary in a 2009 sermon to persecute members of another \nreligious sect. It also alleged that the script of a popular Turkish \ntelevision show was laced with follow-up messages. The case was \ndismissed by a judge in June. \nTurkish government officials, however, say such evidence is valid \nbecause Gulen operates covertly and sends encoded messages to his \nfollowers. \nTurkey has sent the United States new documents in recent days \ncontaining evidence that Turkish authorities say proves the cleric was \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031485 \nbehind the attempted coup. U.S. officials say they are looking through \nthem. \n(Reporting by Julia Harte, Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and James \nDalgleish) \nFrom: Keough, Michael [mailto:  \nSent: Friday, August 05, 2016 1:10 PM \nTo: Will Bohlen ______________________________________ King, Kathryn <.>; Miller, Michael \nKatelyn Wohlford Y.
