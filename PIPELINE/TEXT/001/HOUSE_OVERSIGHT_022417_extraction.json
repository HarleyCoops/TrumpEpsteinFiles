When New York City real estate thrives, home \nbuilders and buyers seek to colonize neighborhoods previously deemed undesirable. \nThe Financial District was once the exclusive domain of nine-to-fivers; these days, \nevery other office building is a condominium. Along the Hudson River, midtown \nManhattan used to be an industrial no-man's-land of warehouses and strip clubs. \nNo more — residential projects abound. And now the Upper East Side neighborhood \ndubbed Yorkville, which stretches from about 72nd to 96th streets east of Third \nAvenue, is ready for its turn. \n206-208 East 35th Street \nNew York, NY 10016 \nTRENDING NOW ON \nNYPOST.COM \nView Details \n54927 \n11... \nABC's David Muir nicknamedC \n'Anchor Monster' \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022434 \n22055 \nYORKVILLE \n4-94, \n$94 SOFII \n0 \n9 \n-4 se la e' 0 \nManhattan \n0, \n0 \n1. \n7-\n3. \n4. \n5 \n7. \n‘P 0 \n302 E. 96th St \nThe Kent \nCarnegie Park \n205 E 92nd St. \nCitizen 360 \n180 E tti St \nExte II's Gristedes stle \nI East \nRiver \n8. 5541.82nd SL \n9. 225E81st St \n10.

More than a dozen \nnew buildings are on the way, and with them a crop of \nbuyers who see Yorkville as a place where apartments \nare a relative bargain. \nYes, until the Second Avenue subway comes online in \napproach the East River. But the Q extension's \nimminent completion — coupled with a new Whole Foods and easy access to parks, \nmuseums, hospitals and other family-friendly perks — all mean people want in on a \nneighborhood in the throes of a transformation from nice 'n' quiet to construction-\ninduced, decibel-busting busy. \nExtell Development sure wants a piece of the action, shelling out $100 million for a \nGristede's grocery store on 86th Street near First Avenue. (The property giant already \nowns at least four tenement buildings in the vicinity, and reports say it's cobbled \ntogether enough land to build something big.) Extell has also filed plans for two \nsmaller projects on 92nd Street and Second Avenue, plus, it's already begun the \nfoundation of a 30-story building at the corner of 95th and Third Avenue, just a block \nsouth of the boundary with East Harlem. Called The Kent, sales of 83 luxe two- to five-\nbedroom residences in a handsome brick structure will hit the market in the fourth \nquarter. Talk about flooding the zone! \nA biker tackles Carl Schurz Park's scenic promenade alongthe East River. \nPhoto: NY Post Brian Zak \nNote that The Kent, set for completion in the fall of 2017, is replacing a row of walk-up \ntenements that used to dominate their block.

(Icon is \nworking on a second high-rise as well as a shorter rental building in the same neck of \nthe woods.) \nJust look to other data and the same trend emerges. In 2010, Yorkville's median sale \nprice was $663,500, according to real estate listings site StreetEasy. Compare that to \nthe first seven months of this year — it's 14 percent higher, at $757,500. But remember, \nthe sub-market remains cheaper relative to the Upper East Side at large, which boasts \na year-to-date median of $1.15 million. \nGet your fill of brats and glass boots of Warsteiner at Heidelberg. \nPhoto: Stefano Giovannini \nDespite the building boom, some low-rises remain, housing institutions, such as \nGerman butcher Schaller & Weber and beer garden Heidelberg, that are vestiges of \ncenturies past when Yorkville was an immigrant enclave. \nSchaller &Weber owner Ralph Schaller happily holding his weisswurt. \nPhoto: Anne Wermiel/NY Post \nLet's hope they can hang on: Even more small buildings were razed to make way for \nstar architecture firm SHoP (of Barclays Center fame) to design a tower of 83 condos \nwith Anbau Enterprises at the corner of 89th Street and First Avenue.

This is not a building full of $10 \nmillion apartments.\" Still, it points to a future far more \nexpensive than the current data shows. \nJust one block from 113-year-old Jewish bakery \nGlaser's, which churns out delicious black-and-white \ncookies, Citizen360's shimmery facade will rise 410 feet \nabove street level. But trumping them all will be DDG's \nunder-construction goliath on 180 E. 88th St. At 521 \nfeet, it will be the tallest structure on the Upper East \nSide north of 72nd Street. Its 48 apartments with 16-\nfoot ceilings and custom lobby artwork launch sales this \nfall, with two-beds starting from $3.4 million, three-\nbeds from $4.5 million and four-beds from $7 million. \nIt's not all about living among the clouds, though. \nMichael D'Alessio, president of Michael Paul \nEnterprises, oversaw the overhaul of two smallish \nrental buildings east of Third Avenue into boutique luxury projects. \"They were prime \nlocations for condominiums catering to families,\" says D'Alessio of the projects, 225 E. \n81st St. (a.k.a The Justin) and 554 E. 82nd St., which have nine apartments between \nthem. \"They are three or four bedroom units, with big living and dining areas with \nfireplaces, and they all have outdoor space.\" Six have been snatched up, with asks \nranging from $2.25 million for a two-bedroom to $5.99 million for a four-bedroom. \nA fireplace-sporting unit inside 554 East 82nd St. \nPhoto: Michael Paul Enterprises \nMeanwhile, another rental-to-condo conversion — Carnegie Park — attracted first-\ntime buyer Elizabeth Dean, who realized Yorkville offered more bang for her buck after \nhouse-hunting in lower Manhattan. \n\"Originally, I wasn't going to go north of 86th Street. I didn't know what was above \nthere,\" says Dean, 29, who works in finance, paid $1,184 per square foot for her one-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022437 \nbedroom and loves the restaurants, bars and grocery stores that dot the area \nFirst-time homebuyer Elizabeth Dean in a model \nunit at Carnegie Park. She moves into her own \none-bedroom soon. \nPhoto: Brian Zak \nIn July, StreetEasy reports Yorkville's median \nprice per square foot was $1,098, up 5.1 \npercent from the year prior and a whopping \n29.8 percent from the month prior. The Upper \nEast Side as a whole, of course, boasts a \nhigher median: $1,694 per square foot in July. \n\"It'll actually be a great investment,\" Dean \nsays. \"Downtown is extremely pricey, and I \nthink there's a lot more upside to the Upper \nEast Side.\" \nPart of Carnegie Park's makeover includes a \nslate of plush amenities designed by classicist \nRobert A.M. Stern, the architect behind \nfamously ritzy buildings like 15 Central Park West. (The pool, the roof deck and the in-\nhouse \"mini-Equinox\" gym lured Dean.) Available apartments range from a $955,000 \none-bedroom to a $7.15 million penthouse. \nYou'll be able to drive up to 20 East End in style via its porte-cochere and motor court. (The latter is depicted in \nthe rendering.) \nPhoto: Hayes Davidson \nStern is also working on a ground-up project at 20 East End Avenue that could pass as \na setback-laden prewar, with old-school details like a porte-cochere, which allows \nresidents to enter in a vehicle via an archway from the street and drive right up to the \nlobby door in a circular motor court. One of these hasn't been a part of any newly \nconstructed building since the 1930s! About half of its 43 condos, spread across 18 \nstories, are in contract from $4.49 million to $14.25 million. \nStill, three-fourths of New York City residents are renters, and the Upper East Side's \nnew crop of construction has something for them, too. Related has topped out on a 36-\nstory tower at 205 E. 92nd St., where a playground used to sit. The uber-fancy \ndevelopment will have a massive two-story Equinox gym and a private school for kids \nwith language-based learning disabilities on its lower floors. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022438 \nThe under-construction rental at 205 E. 92nd St. \nPhoto: Brian Zak \nThe apartments above, set for completion and leasing in the spring of 2016, will have \nlayouts that skew in favor of three- and four-bedrooms. \"There will be thermostats \nprogrammable remotely on all the A/C units, and motorized shades in some of the \nunits,\" says Bryan Cho, executive vice president at Related Companies. \"From the \nmarble bathrooms to the highly designed public spaces and the amenities, it's what's \nusually in condominiums.\" \nOn the rental market sooner is The Rose Modern, a 20-story, 82-unit tower currently \nfinishing up construction on York Avenue. The leasing office will open the first week of \nOctober offering \"competitive\" rents for a luxury building, according to Bond New \nYork's Douglas Wagner, with move-ins slated for November and December. \nAn art-infused kitchen inside a condo at The Charles. \nPhoto: Evan Joseph Images \nWant to buy now, and move in immediately? The building most ahead of the curve is \nThe Charles. Previously stalled after 2008's downturn, the 32-story condo at 1355 First \nAve. got redesigned to emphasize large full-floor apartments before breaking ground \nin 2012. And it's paid off. There are four units left out of 27 total, which started at \n$5.97 million. A recent sale of the top six floors to two unidentified relatives for a total \nof $59 million made headlines. That price? On First Avenue? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022439 \nFirst look! Once a three-story \ngarage, 302 E. 96th St. will become \na 21-story luxury condo. \nPhoto: Handout \n\"The preconceived idea of what was considered prime and where you would build \nluxury has completely changed,\" says Jason Karadus of Town, who is director of sales \nfor the Charles along with Ginger Brokaw. \"A lot of people in the industry smirked at \nthe pricing — about $2,500 per square foot ... Now it's not so risky, which is why you're \nseeing companies like Extell building up what's left to be developed up there.\" \nEvery developable parcel seems to be getting snatched \nup. Just take a three-story garage on 302 East 96th \nStreet, which developer Wonder Works bought in March \nfor $24 million. On the northernmost border with \nHarlem, the developer plans to put up a 21-story, 48-\nunit \"affordable luxury\" condo building — basically \nright on the approach to the FDR. (Don't worry, the \nfacade will have extra soundproofing.) \n\"The Second Avenue subway station for 96th street, \nwhich will be one of the first ones opened, is just 200 \nfeet away,\" says Eric Brody, Wonder Works' managing \npartner, who adds that brokers are recommending \nasking prices of $1,500 to $2,300 per square foot when \nunits go on sale next year. \"The buyer is anyone who \ncan't afford to be in all these downtown neighborhoods, \nbut still wants to live in the city and have incredibly \nclose access to a train.\" \nPublic transit of the future is why Andrew Ellis bought \na fixer-upper on 95th Street and Second Avenue in \n2013. The 31-year-old consultant paid a mere $430 per \nsquare foot for a one-bedroom garden-level duplex. \nThen came a massive year-long renovation that updated the windows and kitchen \nappliances. He also completely redid the backyard, adding a rear deck and koi pond. In \nYorkville, Ellis discovered a \"neighborhood feel\" that was a far cry from the raucous \nscrum of Murray Hill, where he had been renting. \n\"I had sort of grown out of that,\" says Ellis, who is no longer alone in his move uptown. \n\"My high school friends and some college friends are migrating to the Upper East Side. \nOne is two doors down, literally, and two others are a few blocks away. Having that \nsubway there eventually is really what did it for me. This place can only go up.\" \nAndrew Ellis stands in his Yorkville backyard, which he completely redid, adding a deck (so that the outdoor \nspace was accessible from the upstairs living room of the duplex) and a koi pond. \nPhoto: Brian Zak \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022440 \nanbau \nDESCRIPTION \n360 East 89th Street \nNew York, NY \n360 East 89th Street Is a new constructIon luxury \ncondomlnIum bulldIng located In Manhattans \nUpper East SIde between Carl Schurz Park on the \nEast RIver and the new Second Avenue subway \nThe bulldIng mil offer a full range of resIdence \ntypes all wIth floor to celllng wInclows Innovative \nkItchens and hIgh celllngs Over 7500 SF of \namenty space mil be available for the resIdents \nuse and an on-slte fully automated parkIng \nfacIllty Is also planned \nCOMPLETION DATE \n2017 \nSIZE \n209 000 SF 34 stones \nUNIT MIX \n83 one two three four bedroom and penthouse \nunIts \nAMENITIES \n24 hour doorman gym and fitness stud° \nchIldrens playroom catenng kItchen tenant and \nlake storage common laundry &automated \nparkIng facIllty \nTEAM \nArchltect \nSHoP Archltects \nIntenor DesIgner Clodagh De&gn \nEnglneers \nCosentInl Associates \nThornton Tomasettl \nMarketIng &Sales The Corcoran Group \nCreatIve Agency IF Stud° \nContractor Ryder ConstructIon Inc \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022441 \nseandessay with a muitiserseratkinal corn-\nBig Ticket 1355 First Avenue \ntor the env \nI \nFour Floors, One Apartment ima. \nA three-apartment penthouse \nounblnatiun. spanning the top \nInto floors of the Charles condo-\nminium at 1355 First Avenue, at,, \nfor 537.94 million and was the \nmost expensive closed sake of the \ntielfek. according to city mounts_ \nWrr: \n$37,940,000 \nThe price is the highest ever \npaid for a home on the Upper East \nSide east at riled Avenue. accord-\ning to CityReolty. which tracks cn-\nop and condo Wes. \nThe common charges for PHI, \nan 11.744-utuare-foot quadniplot \nwith 1,3(M) square feet at private \nterraces on two levels and views \nthat extend north, south and from \nnver to river. are $10,547 a month. \nTaxes are $4,048 a month, abated \nthrough 20211 \nThe buyer, who was shielded \nunder a limited liability company, \nCRE Acquisition L created \nthe Sprawhng unit by combining \nthe original duplex penthouse. \npriced at $16.5 million, with the \ntwo contiguous floors beneath, \ntine priced at 110.iii million and \n!he other at SIO 63 million \nThe three \naParunents.o Boors \n71 to 3.7., comprise admen bed-\nrooms and 1•2 and a Wolf both-\n.0041i \n1356 First Avrnue \nmums But &warthog to a publi-\ncist for the Charles, the buyer. \nwho is Ameriam, ts cresting a \ncustom confIgunition with 13-fool \nceilings and a pnvate elevator. \n-It's like having a taWribOuSe, \nbut with views and the services of \nan ultraluxury condominium.\" \nsaid R.
