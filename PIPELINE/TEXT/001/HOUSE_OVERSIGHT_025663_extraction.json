As new transactions occur, data is quickly\ndisseminated to, verified, and incorporated across all nodes on the network.\n• Because it has no single maintainer, the blockchain’s history is resistant to editing by a malicious actor.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, http://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/how-does-cryptocurrency-work-2/ .\n4\nBlockchain Technology Holds Potential for a Range of\nApplications\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\n1.

It allows users to make transactions and store money in a secure and\npseudonymous manner.\n• All cryptocurrency transactions are recorded chronologically on a blockchain, which acts as the critical infrastructure\nunderlying a cryptocurrency.\n• The process of verifying transactions and ensuring the validity of the blockchain is called “mining.”\n• Mining solves the “double-spending” problem that had plagued previous attempts to implement a digital currency.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, http://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/how-does-cryptocurrency-work-2/ .\n6\nHow Do Miners Process Individual Transactions?\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\nStep 1: Bob wants to pay Alice 0.5 BTC\nIllustrative Schematic of a Bitcoin Transaction\nStep 2: Miners Verify the Transfer Request and add\nit to the next block\nStep 3: Block Containing Bob and Alice’s\nTransaction is Added to the Blockchain\nBob\nAlice\nMiner\nB\nBob owns 1BTC\nPrevious transaction\nin which Bob was\npaid 1 BTC\nNew transaction\nMiner\nA\nBob wants to pay\nAlice 0.5BTC\nDoes Bob have\n0.5BTC??\nYes!\nMiner\nC\n1) Before sending any bitcoins, Bob must hold bitcoins\nin his wallet from a previous transaction (or by\nsolving a block to earn the mining reward).\n2) Bob creates a new transaction in which he pays 0.5\nBTC (of his 1 BTC) to Alice.\n3) Bob broadcasts this transaction to the network for\nvalidation and inclusion in the blockchain.\nBob has 1BTC\nBob wants to pay\nAlice 0.5BTC\nDoes Bob have\n0.5BTC??\nYes!\nRecord Bob’s\n0.5BTC Transfer\nto Alice\nRecord Bob’s\n0.5BTC Transfer\nto Alice\nBob owns 1BTC\nBob wants to pay\nAlice 0.5BTC\nDoes Bob have\n0.5BTC??\nYes!\nRecord Bob’s\n0.5BTC Transfer\nto Alice\n1) Miner B happens to be the first to solve this block\nand adds it to the blockchain. Miner B collects 12.5-\nbitcoin reward.\n2) If Bob’s transaction is included the block, Alice\nbecomes the owner of 0.5 BTC, which will register\nin her wallet.\n• Consensus transaction validation creates a book of record for all transactions that have ever occurred.\n– Transactions may only occur if they are supported by evidence from previous transactions.\n– To send bitcoins, an owner’s wallet uses its private key to prove ownership of the referenced bitcoins.\n• Transaction processing typically take 10-20 minutes, but can take up to 18 hours if the network is congested.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group. 7\nWhat is Mining?\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\nASIC Mining Computer and a Mining Rig\n6.2”\n13.8”\n5.3”\n• Miners use highly specialized computers designed to run an algorithm that attempts to solve a cryptographic puzzle in order\nto add a new block on the blockchain. By design, a bitcoin block is created once every ten minutes.\n• The computing power required to solve the cryptographic puzzle is high and expensive; bitcoin mining consumes an\nestimated $1.3bn worth of electricity annually 1 —equivalent to Ireland’s annual electricity consumption.\n• In order to incentivize mining, the first miner to complete a block is rewarded 12.5 bitcoins. The global supply of bitcoins is\ncapped at 21mil (currently ~16.5m) and follows a predetermined growth rate—the miners’ rewards halve every four years.\n• Given ~1-1.5m mining units globally, the likelihood of any one miner solving a block is low. Many miners join “mining\npools,” which are cooperatives which share block rewards proportionate to contributed mining power.\n– Mining pools are highly concentrated; the top four pools represent over 50% of total mining power.\n(1) Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index: https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, http://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/how-does-cryptocurrency-work-2/.\n8\nICOs Fund the Development of New Currencies\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\n1.

This process raises capital through token sales.\n• In an ICO, the object offered is either a new digital coin or a yet-undeveloped concept in search of funding. ICO investors\npurchase an ownership percentage of a future money supply or functionality.\n• While many ICOs support legitimate use cases, Autonomous Research asserts, “unfortunately, many ICOs are fraudulent.” 1\n• Rather than raising fiat currency, ICOs primarily raise capital in the form of Bitcoin and Ether, driving additional demand for\nthe cryptocurrencies.\n(1) #Token Mania, Autonomous Research, July 2017.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Cryptocompare.com.\n9\nWhy Have Cryptocurrencies Rallied So Much?\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\n1.

Many of the\nover 2,000 other cryptocurrencies, however, do not have a capped supply. Further, while unlikely, bitcoin’s token cap\ncould be raised if a consensus of programmers decided so.\n• Desired Safe-haven: Increased global participation reflects desire for an asset independent from governments or central\nbanks (“digital gold”). Many governments from which investors have sought diversification, however, have recently\nbanned domestic crypto-exchanges.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg, Cryptocompare.com.\n10\nAs Bitcoin Ownership is Not Anonymous, Illicit Use has Fallen\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\nLarry Fink on Bitcoin’s Illicit Use\n\"Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money\nlaundering there is in the world. That’s all it is. It’s an\nindex of money laundering.”\n– BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, October 13, 2017\n• Because bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous, users’ real-world identities are ascertainable once the individual\nconverts bitcoin to fiat currency.\n• Digital intelligence companies continually scan the blockchain to identify suspicious transaction activity.\n• The Blockchain Intelligence Group estimates that illegal transactions in bitcoin fell from ~50% of total volume in 2015\nto ~20% in 2016, and represent “significantly less than that” today.\n• As law enforcement has become better able to track bitcoin ransom, cybercriminals have begun to favor currencies that\nallow anonymity, such as Monero and Zcash, and even Ether.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Blockchain Intelligence Group, https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/29/dark-web-finds-bitcoin-increasingly-more-of-a-problem-than-a-help-tries-otherdigital-currencies.html.\n11\nSovereign Currencies Meet Three Criteria\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\n1) They are used as a medium of exchange.\n– To represent a medium of exchange, an instrument must facilitate the transaction\nof goods or services between parities (US$ are used to buy a barrel of oil).\n2) They serve as unit of account.\n– A unit of account is a measurement which allows value to be accounted and\ncompared (a barrel of WTI is worth ~$55).\n3) They are a store of value.\n– A store of value is an asset that can be saved, stored, and exchanged in the future\nfor a predictable stable value (with 2% annual inflation, a nominal dollar today\nwill be worth 82¢ in 10 years).\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Do Digital Currencies Pose a Threat to Sovereign Currencies and Central Banks?, Daniel Heller, PIIE.\n12\nDo Cryptocurrencies Meet the Criteria for Currencies?\n1) Bitcoin is an Inefficient Medium of Exchange\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\nAverage Transaction Fees (US$ Monthly Average)\n6\n5\n4\n$ Per Transaction\n3\n2\n$3.4\n$2.1\n1\n0\nJan-17 Mar-17 May-17 Jul-17 Sep-17 Nov-17\n• Processing is expensive.

Transaction processing typically takes a minimum of 10-20 minutes, but can take up to 18 hours if\nthe network is congested (Visa and Mastercard authorize transactions in ~20 milliseconds).\n• Bitcoin is not broadly accepted. A mere 9k merchants accept bitcoin, compared to the 37mil that accept Visa and\nMasterCard, and the billions of merchants and people globally that accept US dollars. 1\n• Further, the IRS considers all cryptocurrency gains a taxable event (including for de minimis purchases).\n(1) Do Digital Currencies Pose a Threat to Sovereign Currencies and Central Banks?, Daniel Heller, PIIE.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg, Cryptocompare.com. 13\nDo Cryptocurrencies Meet the Criteria for Currencies?\n2) Bitcoin is an Unreliable Unit of Account\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\nIllustrative Pricing: US$ vs. Bitcoin as a Unit of Account\nJanuary 2nd 2017:\n1 Bitcoin =\n$1,012 =\n1 Bosch Dishwasher ($1,079)\nNovember 14th 2017:\n1 Bitcoin =\n$6,590 =\n6 Bosch Dishwashers ($6,474)\n• Bitcoin’s rapid appreciation makes it an unsatisfactory candidate as a unit of account.\n• In January, one could have purchased a dishwasher for one bitcoin. Today, it would cost 1/6 th a bitcoin to buy the\nunit, implying severe deflation over the past several months.\n• In deflationary environments, people hoard their money in order to buy goods more cheaply at a later date, which has\nprompted most people to hoard their bitcoin.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg, Cryptocompare.com. 14\nDo Cryptocurrencies Meet the Criteria for Currencies?\n3) Bitcoin is an Unstable Store of Value\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\n1.

In terms of both count and magnitude, Bitcoin, Ether and Ripple have all\nexperienced more severe drawdowns over their short histories than the S&P 500 has since 1945.\n• Bitcoin exchanges have thin liquidity, which plays a role in driving enormous price movement—so far to the upside, but which\ncould cause a flash crash upon a large sell order. A ~$30 million sell order would likely move the market by 5%.\n• A store of value should predictably preserve wealth.

A lot of the optimism we have at the foundation about disease,\neducation and financial services is because we’re sitting on top of a digital miracle.”\n– Bill Gates, September 25, 2017\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, “Brain Trust: A Rare Joint Interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Bill Gates,” The Wall Street Journal, September 25, 2017.\n24\nKey Takeaways\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\n• Blockchain technology, which underlies cryptocurrencies, is revolutionary, and likely\nto have many applications.\n• Cryptocurrencies are currently too volatile to be a medium of exchange, unit of\naccount, or store of value, and have many vulnerabilities.\n• The cryptocurrency ecosystem will evolve substantially over time.\n• The current incarnation of cryptocurrencies is unlikely to persist, but we expect\ncentral bank digital currencies to prevail.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group.\n25\nInvestment Management Division\nEconomic and Market Monitors\nEconomics Monitor\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\nUS Labor Market Data Period Actual Survey Prior Revised European PMI Data Period Actual Survey Prior Revised\nJOLTS Job Openings (k) Sep 6,093 6,075 6,082 6,090 Markit Eurozone Composite PMI Oct F 56.0 55.9 55.9 --\nInitial Jobless Claims (k) 4-Nov 239 232 229 -- Markit/BME Germany Composite PMI Oct F 56.6 56.9 56.9 --\nContinuing Claims (k) 28-Oct 1,901 1,885 1,884 -- Markit France Composite PMI Oct F 57.4 57.5 57.5 --\nMarkit/ADACI Italy Composite PMI Oct 53.9 54.3 54.3 --\nUS Consumer Sentiment Period Actual Survey Prior Revised Markit Spain Composite PMI Oct 55.1 54.6 56.4 --\nU. of Mich.

Risks vary by the type of investment. For example, investments that involve futures, equity swaps, and other derivatives, as well as non-investment\ngrade securities, give rise to substantial risk and are not available to or suitable for all investors. We have described some of the risks associated with certain investments\nbelow. Additional information regarding risks may be available in the materials provided in connection with specific investments. You should not enter into a transaction or\nmake an investment unless you understand the terms of the transaction or investment and the nature and extent of the associated risks. You should also be satisfied that\nthe investment is appropriate for you in light of your circumstances and financial condition.\n• Money Market Funds. Investments in money market funds are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Although money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by\ninvesting in money market funds.\n• U.S. Registered Mutual Funds / ETFs or Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs). A Prospectus and, if available, a summary prospectus for the applicable\nmutual fund, ETF or ETN containing more information may be obtained from your Private Wealth Management team. Please consider a fund's\ninvestment objectives, risks, charges and expenses, and read the summary prospectus or the Prospectus carefully before investing, as they contain\nthis and other information about the mutual fund.\n31\nImportant Information\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\nYou may obtain documents for ETFs or ETNs for free by 1) visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/; 2) contacting your Private Wealth Management\nteam; or 3) calling toll-free at 1-866-471-2526. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value and are not directly\nredeemable by the fund.\nYou should understand the risks associated with leveraged or inverse ETFs, ETNs or commodities futures-linked ETFs before investing. These types of securities may\nexperience greater price movements than traditional ETFs and may not be appropriate for all investors. Most leveraged and inverse ETFs or ETNs seek to deliver\nmultiples of the performance (or the inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis. Their performance over a longer period of time\ncan vary significantly from the stated daily performance objectives or the underlying benchmark or index due to the effects of compounding. Performance differences may\nbe magnified in a volatile market. Commodities futures-linked ETFs may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself, including due to the entering into\nand liquidating of futures or swap contracts on a continuous basis to maintain exposure (i.e., “rolling”) and disparities between near term future prices and long term future\nprices for the underlying commodity. You should not assume that a commodity-futures linked ETF will provide an effective hedge against other risks in your portfolio.\n• Alternative Investments. Alternative investments may involve a substantial degree of risk, including the risk of total loss of an investor’s capital and the use of leverage,\nand therefore may not be appropriate for all investors. Private equity, private real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments structured as private investment\nfunds are subject to less regulation than other types of pooled vehicles and liquidity may be limited. Investors in private investment funds should review the Offering\nMemorandum, the Subscription Agreement and any other applicable disclosures for risks and potential conflicts of interest. Terms and conditions governing private\ninvestments are contained in the applicable offering documents, which also include information regarding the liquidity of such investments, which may be limited.\n• Emerging Markets and Growth Markets. Investing in the securities of issuers in emerging markets and growth markets involves certain considerations, including:\npolitical and economic conditions, the potential difficulty of repatriating funds or enforcing contractual or other legal rights, and the small size of the securities markets in\nsuch countries coupled with a low volume of trading, resulting in potential lack of liquidity and in price volatility.\n• Equity Investments. Equity investments are subject to market risk, which means that the value of the securities may go up or down in respect to the prospects of\nindividual companies, particular industry sectors and/or general economic conditions. The securities of small and mid-capitalization companies involve greater risks than\nthose associated with larger, more established companies and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements.\n• Fixed Income. Investments in fixed income securities are subject to the risks associated with debt securities generally, including credit/default, liquidity and interest rate\nrisk. Any guarantee on an investment grade bond of a given country applies only if held to maturity.\n• Non-US Securities. Investing in non-US securities involve the risk of loss as a result of more or less non-US government regulation, less public information, less liquidity\nand greater volatility in the countries of domicile of the issuers of the securities and/or the jurisdiction in which these securities are traded. In addition, investors in\nsecurities such as ADRs/GDRs, whose values are influenced by foreign currencies, effectively assume currency risk.\n• Real Estate. Investments in real estate involve additional risks not typically associated with other asset classes, such as sensitivities to temporary or permanent\nreductions in property values for the geographic region(s) represented. Real estate investments (both through public and private markets) are also subject to changes in\nbroader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates.\n• Structured Investments. Structured investments are complex, involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Investors in structured investments assume the credit risk\nof the issuer or guarantor. If the issuer or guarantor defaults, you may lose your entire investment, even if you hold the product to maturity. Structured investments often\nperform differently from the asset(s) they reference. Credit ratings may pertain to the credit rating of the issuer and are not indicative of the market risk associated with the\nstructured investment or the reference asset. Each structured investment is different, and for each investment you should consider 1) the possibility that at expiration you\nmay be forced to own the reference asset at a depressed price; 2) limits on the ability to share in upside appreciation; 3) the potential for increased losses if the reference\nasset declines; and 4) potential inability to sell given the lack of a public trading market.\n32\nImportant Information\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\nOptions. Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. The purchase of options can result in the loss of an entire investment and the risk of uncovered options\nis potentially unlimited. Please ensure that you have read and understood the current options disclosure document before entering into any standardized options\ntransactions. The booklet entitled Characteristic and Risk of Standardized Options can be obtained from our sales representatives or at\nhttp://www.theocc.com/components/docs/riskstoc.pdf. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies that require multiple purchases and sales of options, such\nas spreads. Supporting documentation for any comparisons, recommendations, statistics, technical data, or other information will be supplied upon request.\n• Buying Options - Investors who buy call (put) options risk loss of the entire premium paid if the underlying security finishes below (above) the strike price at\nexpiration.\n• Selling Options - Investors who sell puts risk loss of the strike price less the premium received for selling the put.\nOTC Derivatives. To understand clearly the terms and conditions of any OTC derivative transaction you may enter into, you should carefully review the Master Agreement,\nincluding any related schedules, credit support documents, addenda and exhibits. You may be requested to post margin or collateral at levels consistent with the internal\npolicies of Goldman Sachs to support written OTC derivatives.\nPrior to entering into an OTC derivative transaction you should be aware of the below general risks associated with OTC derivative transactions:\n– Liquidity Risk: There is no public market for OTC derivative transactions and, therefore, it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate an existing position on\nfavorable terms.\n– Risk of Inability to Assign: OTC derivative transactions entered into with one or more affiliates of Goldman Sachs cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred\nwithout Goldman Sachs’ prior written consent and, therefore, it may be impossible for you to transfer any OTC derivative transaction to a third party.\n– Counterparty Credit Risk: Because Goldman Sachs may be obligated to make substantial payments to you as a condition of an OTC derivative transaction, you\nmust evaluate the credit risk of doing business with Goldman Sachs. Depending on the type of transaction, your counterparty may be Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, a\nregistered U.S. broker-dealer, or other affiliate of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. As a broker dealer regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”), Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is subject to net capital, financial responsibility rules, and other regulatory requirements designed to protect customer assets.\nOther subsidiaries of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may not be registered as a U.S. broker dealer and therefore are not be subject to similar SEC regulation.\n– Pricing and Valuation: The price of each OTC derivative transaction is individually negotiated between Goldman Sachs and each counterparty and Goldman Sachs\ndoes not represent or warrant that the prices for which it offers OTC derivative transactions are the best prices available. You may therefore have trouble establishing\nwhether the price you have been offered for a particular OTC derivative transaction is fair. OTC derivatives may trade at a value that is different from the level\ninferred from interest rates, dividends and the underlyer. The difference may be due to factors including, but not limited to, expectations of future levels of interest\nrates and dividends, and the volatility of the underlyer prior to maturity. The market price of the OTC derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable\nfactors, including economic conditions, the creditworthiness of Goldman Sachs, the value of any underlyers, and certain actions taken by Goldman Sachs.\n– Early Termination Payments: The provisions of an OTC derivative transaction may allow for early termination and, in such cases, either you or Goldman Sachs\nmay be required to make a potentially significant termination payment depending upon whether the OTC derivative transaction is in-the-money at the time of\ntermination.\n– Indexes: Goldman Sachs does not warrant, and takes no responsibility for, the structure, method of computation or publication of any currency exchange rates,\ninterest rates, indexes of such rates, or credit, equity or other indexes, unless Goldman Sachs specifically advises you otherwise.\n33\nImportant Information\nInvestment\nManagement\nDivision\nIndices.
