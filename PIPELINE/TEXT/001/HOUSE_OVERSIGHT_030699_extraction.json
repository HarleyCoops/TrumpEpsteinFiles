But that doesn't change the fact that it is their ONLY \noption. AND it's a slam-dunk one. She would turn it around. If Dylan is coming out to speak publicly, Soon-Yi \nalso has to. If Dylan is allowed to be the center of this story, Woody is cooked. If Soon-Yi claims it—and she is \nactually the center of the story—everything shifts and they can make it their own. \nOn Thu, Jan 18, 2018 at 9:37 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nnot intellectually capable. . and frankly -unwiling. my shrink says........ \nOn Thu, Jan 18, 2018 at 9:32 AM, Michael Wolff > wrote: \nHe has to turn this into a love story with Soon-Yi.

Have to keep reminding people that I am actually quite \nunpopular. Apparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). Ira \nRosen, a 60 Minutes producer and a friend of Bannon's, came with a message from SB: \"You own me \na few million.\" Rosen also says he believes SB now weighing the strategy of making a formal and \npublic break with Trump. I can't get together today because I have to leave for DC at 11AM to speak \nto 800 book buyers (not to mention pre-signing 800 books). Then tomorrow AM to LA to do Bill \nMaher show.
