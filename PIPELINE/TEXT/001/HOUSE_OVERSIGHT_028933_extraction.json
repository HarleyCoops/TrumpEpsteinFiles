A wide area of agreement, but not total. \nOn confronting dogma, I of course agree — though in my opinion the secular religions — nationalist fanaticism, etc. — are \nmuch more dangerous. And if some find rational discussion offensive — as, for example, mainstream academics find \ndismantling myths of \"American exceptionalism\" or \"Israeli self-defense\" or Obama's mass murder campaign, etc., \noffensive — so be it. \nBut I don't see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, while \nrecognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while their \nbeliefs are confronted with evidence. I also don't see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as I don't think we \nshould ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028933 \nargument and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of secular \ndogma) are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard sometimes. For \nexample, when the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs informs us that \nthe US, unlike other countries, has a \"transcendental purpose,\" and the fact that it constantly acts in contradiction to \nits purpose doesn't matter because the facts are just \"abuse of history\" while real history is \"the evidence of history as \nour minds reflect it,\" then it's hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There's no point ridiculing virtually the entire IR \nprofession and the major journals, even though such extraordinary irrationality leads to major human disasters. \nOn Davis, I frankly think that's a non-issue. If she decides she cannot do her job as the conditions of employment \nrequire (including following the law), then she can quit and look for another job. As in any other such case. \nNoam \nFrom: Lawrence Krauss [mailto__________________________ \nSent: Thursday, September 10, 2015 1:51 AM \nTo: Noam Chomsky jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nSubject: an article you may both hate. or like. \nhope all is well. \nLawrence \nhttp://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/all-scientists-should-be-militant-atheists \nLawrence M.
