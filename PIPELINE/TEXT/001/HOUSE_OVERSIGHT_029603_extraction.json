    "full_text": "HARVARD UNIVERSITY \nDEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH \nBarker Center - 12 Quincy Street - Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 \nELISA NEW \nPowell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature \nNovember 25, 2018 \nDear Ms. Williams: \nTel: \nFax: \nI am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest of Poetry in America \n(poetryinamerica.org). Poetry in America's first season's guests included Bill \nClinton, Joe Biden, Cynthia Nixon, Shaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Samantha \nPower, Herbie Hancock, John McCain, Nas, Angela Duckworth, Bono, Regina \nSpektor, Frank Gehry, Stuart Weitzman, E.O. Wilson and many others. Seasons \nTwo and Three will feature just as distinguished a line up. The series airs on \npublic television stations everywhere, streams via Amazon Prime and other \nstreaming services, and it is now also airing on a variety of domestic and \ninternational airlines. \nThe poem we'd read and interpret together is by Pulitzer Prize winner, Sharon \nOlds, and it's called \"The Language of the Brag.\" It's a gutsy poem that \ncompares feats of (male) athletic prowess-- and feats of poetic prowess-- to \nchildbirth. You are the ideal reader for this poem. We would use what we \nfilmed together in upcoming season of Poetry in America. I'll also use the \ncontent in an online course for medical professionals I am creating in \npartnership with Harvard Medical School. \nI thank you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work \nwith you. \nSincerely, \nElisa New \nDirector and Host of Poetry in America \nPowell M. Cabot Professor, Harvard \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029603 \n"
