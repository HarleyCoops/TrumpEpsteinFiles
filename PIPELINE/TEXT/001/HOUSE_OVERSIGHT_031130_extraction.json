You know what the private business sector is \u000ba real-life business, not a government job Here are the percentages. \nT. Roosevelt..................... \t38% \nTaft.................................. \t40% \nWilson ............................. \t52% \nHarding........................... \t49% \nCoolidge.......................... \t48% \nHoover............................ \t42% \nF. Roosevelt.................... \t50% \nTruman............................ \t50% \nEisenhower...................... \t57% \nKennedy.......................... \t30% \nJohnson........................... \t47% \nNixon............................... 53% \nFord................................ 42% \nCarter............................. 32% \nReagan............................ 56% \nGH Bush......................... 51% \nClinton ........................... 39% \nGW Bush........................ 55% \nObama..................... 8% \nThis helps to explain the incompetence of this administration: \nonly 8% of them have ever worked in private business! \nThat's right! Only eight percent---the least, by far, of the \nlast 19 presidents! And these people are trying to tell our big \ncorporations how to run their business? \nHow can the president of a major nation and society, the one \nwith the most successful economic system in world history, stand and talk about business when \nhe's never worked for one? Or about jobs when he has never really had one? And when it's the same for \n92% of his senior staff and closest advisers? They've spent most of their time in academia, \ngovernment and/or non-profit jobs or as \"community organizers.\" They should have been in an employment \nline \nPass this on because we'll NEVER see these facts in the main \nstream media. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031132 \nEnd of Forwarded Message \nNOTE:ThiS message including any attachments contains information, some or all of which, may be \nproprietary or legally privileged.
