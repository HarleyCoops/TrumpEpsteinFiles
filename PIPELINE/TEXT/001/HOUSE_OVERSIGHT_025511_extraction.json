I'd be thrilled to include other scientists you name, perhaps taping the group in a \nsession on metaphor at the edges of fields. \nINote that taped sessions already include economics, marine biology, astronomy, evolutionary biology, \nzoology, physics and computer science. Richard Dawkins, Walter Isaacson, David Mossberg and David \nMalan have all said yes to tapings. Footage for all the others is already shot and ready for post \nproduction. \nI am having a drink with Dean of Ed School today and can explore this with him among other topics \nLisa \nPoetry in America for Teachers II: The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky \nCombining study of poetry with study of science, environment and the visual arts.
