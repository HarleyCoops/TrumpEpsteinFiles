Sunday/ Monday sanction rhetoric from ranging \nfrom g8 expulsion to Iran-style bank embargo is raised a notch. Russia follows with more threats of counter-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022262 \nsanctions. My sense is the Obama 5m of 696m SPR release is to show Merkel and co he will step in. He needs \nto because there are 8 small European and Baltic countries that rec 70%+ of their gas from Russia. Germany \ngets 30%. \nCross asset correlations outside of the US are increasing past few days - eg copper and the Turkish lira hourly \ncharts are on top of each other past 4 days. I'm worried there is a 30-40pct(?) chance of a hard risk off move in \nmarkets in first half of next week - more focused on European equities, copper, EM FX (Turkey, ZAR, Ruble \netc) than SPX. In that scenario oil is way up. \nExchange WTI calls - there are 2 options (as of 3pm est): \n5day expiry 17march 2014 underlying clj4 97.92 \nand \n35d expiry 16apri12014 underlying clk4 97.59 \n** The 5 day options are a bit short - one possibility is sell a 3usd out of the money put (95.5 strike) for \n20cents and buy a 2usd OTM 100 call for 25. Net pay Scents. But 5d is a bit short for me. \n**For 35d expiry You could look at selling 91.50 (6usd OTM put) for 56cents and buying 103c (5.5usd OTM) \nfor 58cents or the 102c (4.5usd OTM) for 76cents. \nCL1 <comdty> OMON on Bloomberg has live strikes and bid/ask. \nIf 5d is too short and 35d is too long / not enough gamma, Tazia may be able to source liquidity from the \nstreet.
