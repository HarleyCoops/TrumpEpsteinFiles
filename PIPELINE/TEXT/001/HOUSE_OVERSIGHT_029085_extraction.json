What's been stimulating as a source of good questions for the \"distributions in nature\" issue? \n7. \"Signal intelligence in biol. systems\" seems to cover all of neurophysiology: Jonathan Victor, whom you met \na few years ago in your office, is powerfully thoughtful on the issues of neural coding. Are there specific \nexamples that have stimulated you to better questions or turned your thinking around? \n6. Are you aware of apps that purport to play music to enhance productivity and focus on tasks at hand? My \nbuddy Reese Jones has backed that; he has a fascinating set of beliefs and projects around what may soon be \nunderstood as \"consciousness hacking.\" He's on the board of Singularity University as one of the founders. (His \nfather was a pioneer UCSF MD researcher of hallucinogens, I believe!) \nMore to come in a day or so. \nThanks! \nYou're up late or you're not so east of my SF location! \nDavid \nPS How to trade the Trump-GOP demolition of the welfare state, erratic elevation of risks of trade disruptions \nand war? Has anyone from the rational center or left given thought to how to respond to a national emergency to \ncope with a kakistocratic seizure of emergency powers?
