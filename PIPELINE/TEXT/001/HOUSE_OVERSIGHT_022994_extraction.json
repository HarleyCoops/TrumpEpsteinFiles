My initial questions are fairly general I believe. \nWas Former Pres Clinton ever a guest on the island? \nWas George Mitchell a guest? \nWould any of the guests get massages from the girls brought by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell? \nDo you remember \nWhat was her interaction with Ms. Maxwell? \nHow many massages would Mr. Epstein get per day? I understand that the massages happened in a location where, \nbased on the article I read, Ghislaine instructed you to never go while in use. But I am curious knowing - were the \nmassages done by the various young girls brought to the island? Did they appear to be massage therapists? I think I \nknow that answer based again on the previous article I read. \nWere you aware of Ghislaine flying a helicopter? Flying girls to the island? Flying guests to the island? \nWhat did you understand Ghislaine's role to be? How did she describe herself or act while there? If she was the \n\"queen bee\" girlfriend, then what was her explanation of the presence of the other younger girls? And what \ninteraction did Ghislaine have with those girls? It is our understanding that one of her primarily \"jobs\" was to find \nthe girls to bring to Mr. Epstein but we do not yet have a firm understand where she found them or what interaction \nshe personally had with each of them while on the island. I was hoping you could provide some clarity based on \nthings you heard or observations you made. \nAgain, thank you for any clarification you can provide. I am interested in the facts, including any inaccuracies that \nhave been reported in the past which may have given us a misunderstanding of anything. \nSincerely, \nBrad \nSent from my iPhone \nOn May 18, 2016, at 4:05 AM, Miles Alexander < > wrote: \nGreetings \nThank you for your letter and sentiments contained there in. \nCathy and I have read a number of articles that have appeared in the press over the past few years.

She doesn't need much. In fact, all she needs are some good, honest people who are \nwilling to just tell the truth. That seems like a simple request that any compassionate person would \naccommodate; however, for some reason many people have instead decided to stay out of it and allow \nto continue to suffer. A small number of good people have stood up for what is right and told the \ntruth. We do not currently know where you stand but we know that you have helpful information and \nare hopeful that you will cooperate in sharing that information with us. \nI have investigated various related aspects of this unfortunate story for 8 years now. is one of \nnumerous clients I have represented in related matters. And only wants one thing - for the truth \nto be known and for her story to protect others. She was a teenager when she was recruited to travel \nwith Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. After 2 years she escaped that life and lived in \nhoping to forget what she had been through. After Mr. Epstein was arrested for doing similar things to \nother girls that he had done to her, lecided to speak out about what really had transpired while \ntraveling with Maxwell and Epstein, including events that occurred on Little St. James. \nShe remembers you and your wife fondly. We read the interview you gave a few years back. There can \nbe no doubt that we absolutely appreciate the probably unwanted media attention that your previous \ninterview drew. We are not at all looking for a second round of that. We are not the media. We do not \nneed any public interview. We are not concerned with anything other than the facts, from your own \nobservations or what you heard while working on the island. We just want to speak with you. \ncame back to the United States to help others similarly victimized. Specifically, she started a non-\nprofit charity to help sex abuse victims. She very bravely told her story with the goal of starting a new life \nhelping others. Unfortunately, Ms. Maxwell told the world that was lying, which has thus far had \nthe impact of destroying 's charity. We are in litigation with Ms. Maxwell where we have to prove \nsomething that should be very simple - that is in fact telling the truth in her story of being \nrecruited by Ms. Maxwell to travel and \"work\" for Mr. Epstein. We know she is being truthful. We also \nknow that there are numerous witnesses who also know she is. But many of the witnesses still work for \nMr. Epstein or cannot be located. \n- as well as any others similarly situated - deserves the truth. And that is all we are trying to \ncapture for her. We promise not to let anyone in the media know we are talking to you. We are not \nlooking to drag you into anything. We are not looking for anything at all more than the truth, and Virginia \nhas told us that of all the people who worked for Mr. Epstein you were the most likely to help. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022996 \nI hope this email finds you well. I apologize for emailing you at an address that appears to be a work \naddress. It is all I had. If there is a time when you would be so kind as to talk with me, I would be most \ngrateful. You can email me. Call me. Set up a time for me to call you. Whatever is most convenient for \nyou.
