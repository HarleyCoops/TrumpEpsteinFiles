Feel free to contact me \non after reviewing. Kind regards - Matt \nA former employee has told us that Donald Trump attended Mr Epstein's Palm Beach estate on at least two occasions.

Does Mr Epstein have a comment? \nDid or does Mr Epstein have cameras inside rooms at his Palm Beach residence? \nDid Mr Epstein remove those cameras before police raided the property as part of the investigation into alleged crimes?

We would be looking for on record comments or a \"no comment\" to our \nquestions. But I am certainly happy to have an off record conversation with yourself as well. Perhaps we \ncould set up a time to chat briefly off record on Monday before I send you our questions for Mr Epstein? \nKind regards, \nMatt \nOn 11 August 2018 at 11:08, Martin G.
