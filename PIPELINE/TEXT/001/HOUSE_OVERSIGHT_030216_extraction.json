I've been spending lots of time with Irwin Corey and his family past two weeks especially. He \nwas in hospital until the last week and then He died a few hours ago peacefully at home in bed. Last night he \ntold me Trump will be assassinated soon. He was eager to learn the news each day. I asked him if he would \njoin the anti Trump rallies when he gains strength. Doctors thought he might live many months. Alas he was \nlaughing and smiling till the end and frowning about Trump. \n>> Warm and loving regards \n>> Jim Drougas \n>> My friend Alana, a young comedian, was here with him most nights. Irwin used to say he will live to 147. \nAlana explained that 102 is 147 in comedian years. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
