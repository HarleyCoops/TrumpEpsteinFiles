    "full_text": "﻿California woman accusing Donald Trump of raping her when she\nwas 13 years old to break her silence\nThe woman behind a potentially damaging lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of raping her when she was an\nunderage teen will break her silence today, her lawyer said.\nThe California woman, known until now as “Jane Doe,” will finally give voice to long-denied allegations\nthat the Republican presidential nominee sexually assaulted her in New York during a series of sex parties\nhosted by alleged billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in 1994.\nThe woman filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court in June. She is scheduled to speak at a Los\nAngeles press conference this afternoon.\nShe said she was 13 at the time of the alleged attacks.\nLawsuit accusing Trump of raping girl, 13, gets December hearing\n“Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal any of the\ndetails of Defendant Trump’s sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be physically\nharmed if not killed,” the plaintiff said in an affidavit.\n12 photos view gallery\nThe women accusing Donald Trump of sexual assault\nShe says that since Trump launched his campaign and received mass media coverage, she has been\n“subjected to daily painful reminders of the horrific acts.”\nA similar lawsuit by the woman was dismissed by a Los Angeles Federal Court in May.\nA lawyer who was representing the woman at the time, Thomas Meagher, said the original suit, which she\nfiled without the help of an attorney, was dismissed because it cited statutes that did not apply to the case.\nTrump campaign manager: There'd be no rape if women were stronger\nAlan Garten, vice president and general counsel of the Trump Organization, has said the allegations were\n“categorically untrue, completely fabricated and politically motivated.”\nEpstein, who is also named as a defendant, has also denied the allegations. Epstein is alleged to have\npreyed on dozens of underage girls in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but pleaded guilty to soliciting a\nminor in just one case in 2008.\nBut the woman’s new lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said the case against\nTrump cannot be ignored. She has even launched a GoFundMe\npage to raise money to support Trump’s sexual assault accusers.\n“My law firm will proudly represent any accusers sued by Donald\nTrump and crowd fund defense costs,\" Bloom tweeted. “Can’t wait\nto take his deposition!”\nBillionaire perv Jeffrey Epstein must testify in victim's\nlawsuit\nBloom is the daughter of noted women’s rights lawyer Gloria\nAllred.\n(Florida Department of Law\nEnforcement/REUTERS)\nTags:\ndonald trump\nlawsuits\nsexual abuse lawsuits\ncalifornia\nnew york sexual assaults\njeffrey epstein\nSend a Letter to the Editor\nJoin the Conversation:\nTweet\n"
