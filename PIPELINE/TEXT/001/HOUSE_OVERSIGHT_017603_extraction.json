This is a critical issue, as many criminal cases may never proceed to\nformal charging. If crime victims have no rights during criminal investigations, then many crime victims will never have any\nrights at all.\nThe issue of whether crime victims have rights in the criminal justice process recently came to a head when the Justice\nDepartment released a memorandum contending that the CVRA does not extend crime victims any rights until prosecutors\nchoose to file formal criminal charges. This led the CVRA's Senate cosponsor, then-Senator Jon Kyl, to fire off an angry letter\nto the Justice Department attacking its position. In our Article, we side with the Act's cosponsor. We believe that, properly\nunderstood, the CVRA does extend crime victims' rights during criminal investigations.\nOur Article proceeds in four parts. First, it highlights the importance of applying the Act before the formal filing of charges by\nillustrating how dozens of victims in a notorious federal sex abuse case were deprived of the ability to participate meaningfully\nin the criminal process when federal prosecutors narrowly interpreted their responsibilities under the Act. Second, the Article\nreviews the purpose, text, structure, and history of the CVRA, concluding that they all support the conclusion that crime victims\nhave rights during criminal investigations. Third, our Article critiques the Department's memorandum, demonstrating that the\nDepartment's analysis is unpersuasive. Fourth and finally, the Article provides a specific approach for determining when rights\nshould attach - specifically when federal law enforcement agencies have identified a crime with sufficient precision to send a\n\"target\" letter to a criminal defendant. We also observe that federal and state prosecutors have already accorded rights to\nvictims before formally filing charges, which further undermines the Department's overly narrow construction of the Act.\nText\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *59\nPage 2 of 31\n[*61]\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, federal and state enactments have given crime victims extensive rights to participate in criminal cases. Many of\nthese rights apply only after the filing of criminal charges, such as the victim's right to be heard during court proceedings. A\ncrime victim's right to deliver an impact statement at sentencing, for instance, can only be exercised after a prosecutor has filed\ncharges against a defendant and obtained a conviction. Other rights, however, can apply even before the formal filing of\ncharges. As one example, the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) 1 extends to federal crime victims the right to \"confer\" with\nprosecutors. But can victims exercise this right before charges have been filed?\nThis question has tremendous practical importance. In many cases, prosecutors negotiate pleas well before any charges are ever\ndrafted. If crime victims' rights enactments do not extend rights to victims until the formal filing of charges, then crime victims\ncan be effectively excluded from the plea bargaining process. Yet the exclusion of victims in early stages of a criminal case\naffects more than just the content of a plea deal. Crime victims will also lose other important rights in the process if the formal\nfiling of charges is the necessary trigger for those rights. If, for example, prosecutors work out a nonprosecution agreement\nwith an offender, they need not notify his victims of what they are doing or of the fact that potential charges will never be filed.\nThe issue of pre-charging rights has most prominently surfaced in connection with federal cases. In 2010, the Department of\nJustice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) weighed in on the issue and released a legal opinion arguing that victims of federal\ncrimes have no CVRA rights during a federal criminal investigation. 2 The Justice Department took the position that rights\nunder the CVRA do not apply until prosecutors formally initiate criminal proceedings by filing a complaint, information, or\nindictment. The Department claims to find support for that limiting interpretation of the statute in its plain language and\nlegislative history.\nShortly after the Department released its opinion, one of the CVRA's congressional sponsors, then-Senator Jon Kyl, sent a letter\nto Attorney General Eric Holder strenuously objecting to the Department's conclusions. Senator Kyl directly stated his view\nthat \"when Congress enacted the [*62] CVRA, it intended to protect crime victims throughout the criminal justice process -\nfrom the investigative phases to the final conclusion of a case.\" 3 Senator Kyl contested the Department's analysis of the statute\nand, in particular, its use of statements from him during Congress's consideration of the CVRA.\nThis Article sides with the CVRA's cosponsor and concludes that crime victims' CVRA rights attach before formal charging.\nBoth the CVRA's plain language and its legislative history lead inexorably to this conclusion, as every court that has considered\nthis issue has concluded. This Article also contends that, as a matter of sound public policy, crime victims should have rights\nbefore the formal filing of criminal charges.\nThis Article proceeds in four parts. Part I frames the issues under discussion by defending the importance of extending rights to\ncrime victims during criminal investigations. Part I also provides background on victims' rights and gives a concrete illustration\nof a case in which the question of pre-charging rights for crime victims has arisen - specifically, the Jeffrey Epstein sex abuse\ncase before a federal court in Florida. In that case, girls victimized by Epstein have argued that they should have been consulted\nabout a federal nonprosecution agreement; Department attorneys have responded that because prosecutors never filed charges,\ngovernment officials had no formal obligations to inform the girls.\n1\nScott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act, Pub.

(June 6, 2011), reprinted in 157 Cong. Rec. S3608 (daily ed. June 8, 2011)\n(statement of Sen. Jon Kyl).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *62\nPage 3 of 31\nPart II reviews the CVRA's purpose, text, structure, and legislative history. This review establishes that the CVRA extends\nrights to crime victims before formal charges are filed.\nPart III critiques OLC's position that the CVRA extends rights to victims only after prosecutors have lodged charges in court.\nThe Department's proffered arguments do not withstand close scrutiny, particularly in light of the fact that the CVRA covers\nfederal agencies involved in the \"detection\" and \"investigation\" of crime, 4 and specifically authorizes crime victims to file\nCVRA motions in situations where \"no prosecution is underway.\" 5\nPart IV then proposes a specific approach for determining when crime victims' CVRA rights attach. This Part explains that the\nrights should attach when federal law enforcement or prosecuting agencies have identified a federal crime and a particular\nvictim with sufficient precision that they would send a \"target\" letter to a criminal defendant in similar circumstances. If\nprosecutors have sufficient information to provide notice [*63] to a potential criminal of his rights, they can do the same for\nhis victims. This Part also notes that the Department of Justice and state prosecutors already successfully provide rights to\nvictims before charging. This successful experience strongly suggests that providing rights to victims early in the criminal\njustice process will not be unduly burdensome.\nI. The Issue of Rights for Crime Victims During Criminal Investigations\nTo consider the question of whether victims should have rights during criminal investigations, some understanding of the\nunderlying purposes of victims' rights enactments will be useful. These enactments are typically designed to make victims\nparticipants in all phases of the criminal justice process. 6 Congress drafted the CVRA, for example, broadly to make crime\nvictims participants in criminal cases. The Jeffrey Epstein sex abuse case demonstrates the importance of victim participation\neven before charges are filed.\nA. A BRIEF HISTORY OF CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS\nThe crime victims' rights movement has sought to make crime victims important participants in the criminal justice process.\nThe movement began in the wake of the Warren Court revolution, which extended new rights to criminal defendants. 7 With\nthe courts paying increasing attention to criminal defendants, crime victims' advocates began to argue that the victims\nthemselves had been overlooked. 8 The movement gained great visibility in the early 1980s when President Ronald Reagan\nappointed the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime. 9 The Task Force published a report concluding that \"the criminal\njustice system has lost an essential balance… . The victims of crime have been transformed into a group oppressively burdened\nby a system designed to protect them. This oppression must be redressed.\" 10\nThe Task Force chronicled how crime victims were treated in all stages of the criminal justice process, from the police\ninvestigation through [*64] court proceedings, and ultimately to any parole or other release of the criminal. The Task Force\n4\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1).\n5\nId. § 3771(d)(3).\n6\nSee Douglas E. Beloof, Paul G. Cassell & Steven J. Twist, Victims in Criminal Procedure 3-39 (3d ed. 2010) (describing reforms from a\nhistorical perspective); see also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a) (2012).\n7\nSee Beloof, Cassell & Twist, supra note 6, at 3-39 (describing the history of victims' rights in American law and the early days of the\nmodern movement).\n8\nSee, e.g., William F. McDonald, Towards a Bicentennial Revolution in Criminal Justice: The Return of the Victim, 13 Am. Crim L. Rev.\n649, 651-55 (1976).\n9\nExec. Order 12,360, 47 Fed.

Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *64\nPage 4 of 31\nthen made a series of recommendations for all criminal justice agencies, including the police, prosecutors, and the courts. 11\nThe recommendations were designed to allow crime victims to receive information about, and to participate in, criminal cases.\nIn its most far-reaching recommendation, the Task Force proposed amending the U.S. Constitution to protect victims' rights. 12\nThe proposed amendment would have built on existing constitutional rights for criminal defendants by extending similar rights\nto crime victims. 13\nAfter the publication of the report, crime victims' advocates secured the passage of a series of state constitutional and\nlegislative reforms. These measures guaranteed victims' rights in the criminal process, such as the right to be notified of court\nproceedings, to attend those proceedings, and to speak at appropriate points in the process, such as plea bargaining and\nsentencing. The measures were embodied in state statutes and, in more than thirty states, state constitutional \"bills of rights\" for\ncrime victims. 14 While many of the measures had narrow participatory rights, 15 some of the amendments also contained\nmore open-ended language, promising victims a right to fair treatment \"throughout the criminal justice process.\" 16\nAfter successfully passing many state constitutional amendments, crime victims' rights advocates sought to achieve the Task\nForce's broadest recommendation: to secure protection for victims' rights in the U.S. Constitution. In 1996, victims' advocates\nproposed a Victims' Rights Amendment in a Rose Garden ceremony attended by President Bill Clinton. 17 The proposed\namendment contained a list of rights for crime victims, largely paralleling the rights contained in state victims' rights [*65]\namendments. 18 Congress considered the amendment several times, but it never obtained the requisite two-thirds support in\nboth houses to secure the Amendment's approval. 19 Critics quarreled not so much with the goals of the amendment but rather\nwith the necessity of constitutionalizing such rights. 20\nB. THE CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS ACT\nUnable to obtain the necessary supermajority to pass a federal constitutional amendment, in April 2004, crime victims' rights\nadvocates decided to focus on federal legislation protecting crime victims. In exchange for backing off from their efforts to\npass a constitutional amendment, crime victims' advocates received near-universal congressional support for a \"broad and\n11\nSee id. at 56-82.\n12\nId. at 114.\n13\nId. at 114-15.\n14\nFor a map depicting the states with (and without) such amendments, see State Victim Rights Amendments, Nat'l Victims' Constitutional\nAmendment Passage, http://goo.gl/znI4YW (last visited Nov. 26, 2013); for discussion, see infra Part IV.D (discussing legislative reforms in a\nnumber of states).\n15\nSee, e.g., Cal.

The Act provided that rights can be \"asserted\" by \"the crime victim or the\ncrime victim's lawful representative, and the attorney for the Government … .\" 28 The courts were also required under the Act\nto \"ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights\" given by the law. 29\nCongress appeared to have at least two goals in mind in passing the CVRA. The first was simply to ensure that crime victims\nunderstood what was happening in the criminal justice process. This goal is apparent from the fact that the CVRA gives crime\nvictims rights to notification about various court hearings, as well as more general rights to confer with prosecutors and to be\ntreated with fairness. 30 The CVRA's Senate sponsors explained:\nIn case after case we found victims, and their families, were ignored, cast aside, and treated as non-participants in a critical\nevent in their lives. They were kept in the dark by prosecutors too busy to care enough, by judges focused on [defendants']\nrights, and by a court system that simply did not have a place for them. 31\nIn passing the CVRA, Congress sought to change the system's obliviousness to crime victims that often \"left crime victims and\ntheir families victimized yet again.\" 32\n19\nHon.

L. & Criminology 59, *66\nPage 6 of 31\nA second overarching purpose of the CVRA was to allow crime victims to play a role in the criminal justice process. Through\nthe CVRA, Congress intended to make victims \"independent participants\" in the criminal justice process. 33 The CVRA\nextends to crime victims a series of \"rights\" in the criminal justice process - rights that the victims have [*67] independent\nstanding to assert. 34 Congress viewed these provisions as establishing a victim's right \"to participate in the process where the\ninformation that [victims] and their families can provide may be material and relevant … .\" 35\nCongress appears to have had both intrinsic and instrumental reasons for wanting crime victim participation. Congress clearly\nthought that such participation was valuable in its own right. Senator Kyl embodied this belief and explained his decision to\nbecome involved in the crime victims' rights movement because of his discovery that victims:\nwere suffering through the trauma of the victimization and then being thrown into a system which they did not understand,\nwhich nobody was helping them with, and which literally prevented them from participation in any meaningful way. I came to\nrealize there were literally millions of people out there being denied these basic rights … . 36\nBut Congress also thought crime victim participation in the criminal justice system could be instrumentally useful. For\nexample, in protecting a victim's right to be heard by those determining a defendant's sentence, a victim might be able to\nprovide important information that could alter that sentence. As a result, the sentence might reflect a fuller appreciation of the\ndanger posed by a defendant, and the judge might take appropriate steps to prevent others from being victimized. 37\nCongress also intended to ensure that crime victims were not revictimized in the criminal justice process - that is, that they\nwould not suffer what scholars have called \"secondary harm\" in the process. 38 The concern is that victims suffer when they\nare excluded from the criminal justice process. Congress sought to end that suffering by making victims meaningful\nparticipants in criminal cases. 39\nC. AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRE-CHARGING ISSUE: THE JEFFREY EPSTEIN CASE\nGiven the potentially expansive scope of victims' rights under both state provisions and the CVRA, a critical question arises\nabout how to apply them: Do the rights come into existence only after prosecutors formally file [*68] criminal charges? Or do\nthey attach at some earlier point in the process? Does v. United States, a federal case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, usefully illustrates the issue. 40 In that case, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida\n32\nId.\n33\nId. at 7302 (statement of Sen.

Jon Kyl).\n40\nDoes v. United States, 817 F. Supp. 2d 1337 (S.D. Fla. 2011). In the interest of full disclosure, two of the authors of this Article (Cassell\nand Edwards) are co-counsel for the victims in this case. The statement of the facts in this Article draws heavily on the victims' allegations as\nthey have detailed in their pending motion for summary judgment in the case. See Jane Doe #1 & Jane Doe #2's Motion for Finding of\nViolations of the Crime Victims' Rights Act and Request for a Hearing on Appropriate Remedies at 3-23, Does, 817 F. Supp. 2d 1337 (No.\n9:08-cv-80736-KAM) [hereinafter Jane Doe Motion] (providing fifty-three proposed facts in the case). The U.S. Attorney's Office has\ngenerally disputed some of these allegations without offering specifics as to what happened. See, e.g., United States' Response to Jane Doe #1\n& Jane Doe #2's Motion for Finding of Violations of the Crime Victim Rights Act and Request for a Hearing on Appropriate Remedies at 34-\n43, Does, 817 F. Supp. 2d 1337 (No. 9:08-cv-80736-KAM) [hereinafter United States' Response]. As of this writing, Epstein has declined to\nintervene in the case to dispute the allegations.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *68\nPage 7 of 31\ndeveloped considerable evidence that Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire with extensive political and social connections, 41 had\nsexually molested more than thirty young girls between 2001 and 2007 at his West Palm Beach mansion. 42 The U.S.\nAttorney's Office entered into contentious plea negotiations with Epstein over how the case should be resolved. The\nprosecutors initially sought a resolution that would have required Epstein to plead guilty to at least a felony sex offense. After\npressure from Epstein, for reasons that have never been clearly explained, 43 the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed to enter into a\nnonprosecution agreement. Under the agreement, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed not to prosecute him and, in exchange,\nEpstein agreed to plead guilty to two state felonies for soliciting prostitution with a minor. After entering those guilty pleas,\nEpstein was sentenced to only eighteen months in state jail. 44 No federal charges were ever filed and [*69] Epstein spent\nmuch of the jail term on \"work release\" to his luxurious office. 45\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office did not tell Epstein's victims about the nonprosecution agreement until well after it had taken effect.\nTo the contrary, even after the nonprosecution agreement had been signed, the Office continued to tell the victims that the case\nwas still \"under investigation\" and that they should be \"patient.\" 46 When the victims learned of the agreement, two of them\n(Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe Number Two) filed suit in federal court under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, arguing\nthat the prosecutors had violated their CVRA right to confer as well as their right to be treated fairly. 47 The victims contended\nthat prosecutors should have conferred with them about the nonprosecution agreement before it became final.\nIn response, the U.S. Attorney's Office argued primarily that it was under no obligation to extend the victims any rights under\nthe CVRA. It was the Government's blunt position that \"CVRA rights do not attach in the absence of federal criminal charges\nfiled by a federal prosecutor.\" 48 In short, the Government argued it was not required to confer in any way with the victims, or\neven treat them fairly, because the CVRA was not yet in play. The issue is thus squarely framed: Is the Government correct in\nits assertion that it has no CVRA obligations in cases like the Epstein case where federal prosecutors never lodged federal\ncharges against a suspect? In view of the CVRA's prominence, resolution of this issue may shed important light on the nature of\ncrime victims' enactments and the breadth of the role that crime victims should have in the criminal justice process.\nII. The CVRA's Application Before Formal Charges are Filed\nTo analyze the issue of whether the CVRA extends rights to crime victims before prosecutors have formally filed charges, it is\nuseful to look at the CVRA's purposes, language, and judicial interpretations. This Part looks at each of these three issues in\nturn.\n41\nSee, e.g., Paul Harris, Prince Andrew's Link to Sex Offender Jeffrey Epstein Taints Royalty in US, Guardian (Mar. 12, 2011),\nhttp://goo.gl/0I4vAE; Landon Thomas Jr., Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery, N.Y.

L. & Criminology 59, *69\nPage 8 of 31\n[*70]\nA. THE CVRA'S PURPOSES\nAn analysis of the CVRA's application before prosecutors have filed charges must begin by assessing the CVRA's purposes\nbecause any interpretation of the CVRA that is divorced from the statute's purposes would run the risk of defeating the statute's\naims. It is axiomatic that courts should \"give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted in the light of the evident\nlegislative purpose in enacting the law in question.\" 49\nAs discussed above, 50 one important goal of the CVRA was to keep crime victims informed about any developments in the\ncriminal justice process. But the need to be informed does not begin with the filing of a formal criminal charge. A crime victim\nneeds to know what is happening before formal charging - during a criminal investigation, for example - just as much as she\nneeds to know what is happening in court. Indeed, she may have a greater need to know, as she may be concerned that the\ncriminal who harmed her is still on the loose, posing a danger to her.\nSimilarly, concerning the second purpose - facilitating victim participation 51 - without a right to pre-charging involvement,\nvictims may be effectively shut out of the process entirely. The Epstein case provides a useful illustration of why the CVRA\nmust be understood to extend rights to victims prior to indictment. The prosecutors handling the investigation reached an\nagreement with Epstein that barred federal prosecution of sex offenses committed against dozens of victims, including Jane\nDoe Number One and Jane Doe Number Two. If CVRA rights did not extend to the negotiations surrounding the agreement,\nthen the victims never would have had any ability to participate in the resolution of the case. 52\nA construction of the CVRA that extends rights to victims before charges are filed would be entirely consistent with the\nCVRA's participatory purpose. If victims have the ability to participate in a pre-charging plea bargaining process, for example,\nvictims can help ensure that prosecutors do not overlook anything that should be covered in the plea deal. For example, victims\nmight be able to obtain agreement to a \"no contact\" order or valuable restitution - points that the prosecutor might fail [*71] to\nconsider in crafting a plea. Similarly, allowing victims to participate early in the process avoids retraumatizing victims. Again,\nas the Epstein case usefully illustrates, it may be extremely difficult for victims to discover after the fact that potential criminal\ncharges against a criminal who has abused them have been secretly bargained away. Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe\nNumber Two, for example, were outraged when they discovered prosecutors had entered into an agreement blocking any\nprosecution of sex offenses Epstein committed against them - and all without telling them. 53\nIn short, the purposes animating the CVRA all suggest that the Act was meant to, and should, extend rights to crime victims\nbefore formal charges are filed.\nB. THE CVRA'S PLAIN LANGUAGE\nWhile the general purposes of the CVRA support a broad interpretation of the Act, it is important to examine whether those\npurposes have been expressed in the Act's language. Without a linkage to the Act's text, the general purpose might not provide\n49\nGraham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 1409 (2010) (quoting United States v.\nBornstein, 423 U.S. 303, 310 (1976)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n50\nSee supra notes 24-27.\n51\nSee supra notes 28-29.\n52\nEven the Justice Department seems to recognize this point. As a matter of policy, the Department extends to victims the right to confer\nwith prosecutors in situations where plea discussions occur before charges have been brought. U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office for Victims of\nCrime, Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance 41-42 (2011 ed., rev. May 2012) [hereinafter Attorney General\nGuidelines].\n53\nWithout disclosing confidential attorney-client communications, this fact is readily apparent from victims' filings in the Epstein case. See,\ne.g., Jane Doe Motion, supra note 40, at 17 (stating that the victims relied on the U.S. Attorney's Office representatives \"to their detriment[,]\"\nthat if they knew the true facts, \"they would have taken steps to object\" to the plea agreement, and that they believed criminal prosecution to\nbe \"extremely important\").\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *71\nPage 9 of 31\na sound basis for interpretation. 54 But the CVRA's plain language makes clear that Congress intended for the law to provide at\nleast some rights to crime victims throughout the criminal justice process, even before the filing of criminal charges.\nAccording to its text, the CVRA provides eight specifically enumerated rights for crime victims and an additional right to be\nreasonably notified of these rights. 55 Some of these rights presuppose the formal filing of criminal charges. For instance, the\nCVRA extends to victims the \"right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding.\" 56 That\nparticular right obviously does not apply before charges are filed, as no \"court proceedings\" exist before a defendant is charged.\nBut the CVRA also promises crime victims rights that are not specifically tied to court proceedings. Perhaps most expansively,\nthe CVRA guarantees victims the \"right to be treated with fairness and with [*72] respect for the victim's dignity and privacy,\"\n57 a broad right that does not appear to be directly linked to a filed court case. Similarly, the CVRA promises victims the\n\"reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case.\" 58 In this section, the CVRA's drafters appear to\nhave eschewed a reference to court proceedings, using a broader term instead. Of course, a \"case\" can refer both to a judicial\ncase before a court and an investigative case pursued by a law enforcement officer. It is common usage to say such things as,\n\"The police officer investigated and solved the case.\" Dictionary definitions of the word \"case\" support this varied\ninterpretation. 59\nIf there remained any doubts about whether the CVRA applies during the investigative part of the criminal justice process, two\nother provisions in the CVRA resolve them. The CVRA specifically directs that \"officers and employees of the Department of\nJustice and other departments and agencies of the United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime\nshall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in [the CVRA].\" 60 Of\ncourse, there would be no reason to direct that agencies involved in the \"detection\" and \"investigation\" of crime have CVRA\nobligations if the Act did not extend to pre-charging situations. Congress thus directly envisioned the victims' rights law to\napply during the \"detection\" and \"investigation\" phases of criminal cases.\nSimilarly, the CVRA's venue provision instructs that crime victims who seek to assert rights in pre-charging situations should\nproceed in the court where the crime was committed: \"The rights described in subsection (a) [of the CVRA] shall be asserted in\nthe district court in which a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime or, if no prosecution is underway, in the district court in\nthe district in which the crime occurred.\" 61 Here again, it is hard to see why this provision would be necessary unless the\nCVRA applies before the formal filing of charges.\nFor all these reasons, the CVRA's plain language indicates that the victims have protected rights under the Act even before\ncharges are filed.\n[*73]\nC.

Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 56 (2012).\n55\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a) (2012) (enumerating eight rights); id. § 3771(c)(1) (requiring government officers use \"their best efforts\" to notify\nvictims of their rights).\n56\nId. § 3771(a)(2).\n57\nId. § 3771(a)(8).\n58\nId. § 3771(a)(5) (emphasis added).\n59\nSee, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 243-44 (9th ed. 2009) (defining, among the definitions of \"case,\" a \"test case\" as \"[a] criminal\ninvestigation\" as in \"the Manson case\"); Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 345 (1993)\n(defining \"case\" as \"a circumstance or situation (as a crime) requiring investigation or action by the police or other agency\").\n60\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (emphasis added).\n61\nId. § 3771(d)(3) (emphasis added).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *73\nPage 10 of 31\nBecause crime victims lack a right to appointed counsel, many victims have difficulty litigating the scope of their rights. 62\nBut in a few cases, victims have been able to secure counsel to argue that they have rights in the criminal justice process during\nthe investigation of federal crimes. When those cases have reached the issue of whether the CVRA applies before charges have\nbeen filed, courts have uniformly agreed with the victims' position.\nPerhaps the leading case to date to assess this question is the Fifth Circuit's decision in In re Dean. 63 There, a wealthy\ncorporate criminal defendant reached a generous plea deal with the Government - a deal that the Government filed for approval\nwith the district court without conferring with the victims. Citing procedural rights under the CVRA, the victims requested that\nthe trial court reject the plea agreement. 64 The District Court for the Southern District of Texas specifically concluded that\nvictims' CVRA rights could apply during the investigation of the crime: \"There are clearly rights under the CVRA that apply\nbefore any prosecution is underway.\" 65 The district court concluded, however, that the Government had not violated the\nCVRA because it had secured judicial permission to dispense with notification to victims. 66\nThe victims sought appellate review in the Fifth Circuit. 67 There, the court concurred with the district court that CVRA rights\napply before trial. Unlike the district court, however, it held that the Government had violated the victims' rights:\nThe district court acknowledged that \"there are clearly rights under the CVRA that apply before any prosecution is underway.\"\nLogically, this includes the CVRA's establishment of victims' \"reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the\nGovernment.\" At least in the posture of this case (and we do not speculate on the [*74] applicability to other situations), the\ngovernment should have fashioned a reasonable way to inform the victims of the likelihood of criminal charges and to ascertain\nthe victims' views on the possible details of a plea bargain. 68\nThe Fifth Circuit then remanded the matter to the district court to determine the appropriate remedy for the violation of the\nvictims' rights. 69\nThe Fifth Circuit's decision in Dean has been cited favorably in four recent district court decisions, which provides further\nsupport for the conclusion that the CVRA applies before charges have been filed. In United States v. Rubin, 70 victims of a\nfederal securities fraud argued that they had CVRA rights even before prosecutors filed a superseding indictment covering the\nspecific crimes affecting the victims. Citing Dean, the District Court for the Eastern District of New York agreed that the rights\n62\nJohn W. Gillis & Douglas E.

L. & Criminology 59, *74\nPage 11 of 31\nwere expansive and could apply before charges were filed but were subject to the outer limit that the Government has at least\n\"contemplated\" charges. 71\nSimilarly, in United States v. Oakum, 72 the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia considered a claim that CVRA\nrights did not apply until after a defendant had been convicted. In rejecting that argument, the court agreed with the Dean court\nthat victims acquire rights even before a prosecution begins. 73\nThe District Court for the Northern District of Indiana held to the same effect in In re Petersen. 74 There, the court held that a\nvictim's right to be treated with fairness and with respect for [his or her] dignity and privacy \"may apply before any prosecution\nis underway and isn't necessarily tied to a \"court proceeding' or \"case.'\" 75 The court, however, found that the \"conclusory\nallegations\" in the victims' petition did not \"create a plausible claim for relief under the CVRA.\" 76\n[*75] Perhaps the most extensive discussion of this issue has come from the Epstein case discussed earlier. 77 Overruling the\nGovernment's argument that the CVRA only applies after the formal filing of charges, Does v. United States held that \"the\nstatutory language clearly contemplates pre-charge proceedings.\" 78 The court in Does explained that \"court proceedings\ninvolving the crime are not limited to post-complaint or post-indictment proceedings, but can also include initial appearances\nand bond hearings, both of which can take place before a formal charge.\" 79 The court also noted that the CVRA's\n\"requirement that officials engaged in \"detection [or] investigation' [of crimes] afford victims the rights enumerated in\nsubsection (a) surely contemplates pre-charge application of the CVRA.\" 80 Finally, the court in Does noted that \"if the\nCVRA's rights may be enforced before a prosecution is underway, then, to avoid a strained reading of the statute, those rights\nmust attach before a complaint or indictment formally charges the defendant with the crime.\" 81\nIn sum, the relevant case law unanimously agrees that the CVRA extends rights to crime victims before charges have been\nfiled.\n71\nId. at 419 (internal citation omitted).

The Justice Department's Unpersuasive Position\nDespite the CVRA's broad remedial purposes, its expansive language referring to investigations, and the unanimous case law\nextending rights to victims prior to defendants being charged, the OLC released a memorandum in 2011 concluding that CVRA\nrights attach only \"from the time that criminal proceedings are initiated (by complaint, information, or indictment).\" 82 OLC's\nanalysis is unpersuasive. Although OLC's opinion [*76] invokes the CVRA's definition of crime \"victim,\" its legislative intent,\nand its structure, a closer reading of each demonstrates little support for the notion that crime victims must await the formal\nfiling of charges before accruing CVRA rights.\nA. OLC'S MISREADING OF THE CVRA'S DEFINITION OF \"VICTIM\"\nOLC's lead argument is that the CVRA's definition of \"victim\" presupposes that criminal charges have been formally filed. 83\nThe CVRA defines a \"victim\" who is protected as \"a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a\nFederal offense.\" 84 Focusing on the word \"offense,\" OLC concedes that it does not \"conclusively resolve\" the question of\nwhen rights attach. Nevertheless, OLC claims that the word \"naturally suggests that a person's status as a \"crime victim' can\nonly be determined after there has been a formal decision to charge a defendant with a particular Federal offense.\" 85 OLC\ngoes on to elaborate:\nUnder this reading, the earliest that a \"crime victim\" under the Act could be identified would be upon the filing of a criminal\ncomplaint - that is, at the earliest point at which there is a sworn written statement of probable cause to believe that a particular\ndefendant committed an identified Federal offense and hence the first point at which it is possible with any certainty to identify\na \"crime victim\" directly and proximately harmed by the commission of that offense. 86\nOLC is disingenuous in asserting that the \"first point\" at which a person has been harmed by a federal crime arises only after a\ncriminal complaint has been filed. The Department routinely makes such determinations at earlier points in criminal cases, such\nas when it sends a \"target letter\" to a defense attorney during a grand jury investigation. 87 Indeed, OLC remarkably ignores\nthe fact that the Department is directly required to identify victims of a crime before the filing of a criminal complaint, both by\nstatute and through internal policy directives.\nThe Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA) 88 requires the Department to identify victims before the filing of a\ncriminal complaint. [*77] Passed in 1990, the VRRA provided crime victims with a set of procedural rights similar to those\nfound in the CVRA, along with rights to notification about victim services. 89 In 2004, the CVRA repealed and replaced the\nsection of the VRRA listing procedural rights, while leaving other parts of the VRRA intact. 90 Under the remaining parts of\n82\nOLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 1.

L. & Criminology 59, *77\nPage 13 of 31\nthe VRRA, the Justice Department must inform victims of federal crimes of services that are available to them, including\n\"emergency medical and social services,\" counseling, and support. 91 The Department is further obligated to keep victims fully\ninformed about \"the status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and to the extent\nthat it will not interfere with the investigation.\" 92 These rights to notice about \"emergency medical and social services\" 93 as\nwell as to the \"status of the investigation of the crime\" 94 obviously require the Department to identify victims of federal\ncrimes before formal charges have been filed. Indeed, the VRRA makes this point clear by directing the Department to not only\nnotify the victim about the status of the investigation but also about the later \"filing of charges against a suspected offender.\" 95\nThe VRRA then extends victims' rights to information through the rest of the criminal justice process by requiring the\nDepartment to provide notice to victims of such things as the imposed sentence and the defendant's release. 96\nThe VRRA not only requires the Department to identify victims during the investigation of a crime, it also defines those\nvictims in a very similar fashion to the CVRA. The VRRA defines \"victim\" as a \"person that has suffered direct physical,\nemotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of a crime.\" 97 Thus, the Department is already routinely\nidentifying persons who have been \"harmed\" by federal crimes shortly after the commission of those crimes and well before\nformal charging.\nThe Attorney General has also promulgated internal guidelines requiring Justice Department components to identify victims\nrapidly after a crime. The Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance provide that \"Department\nresponsibilities to crime victims begin as soon as possible after the detection of a crime at which they may be undertaken\n[*78] without interfering in the investigation. Generally, this point in time is defined by the opening of a criminal\ninvestigation.\" 98\nGiven the way the two statutes work, it would make no sense to artificially confine the CVRA's reach until after the filing of a\ncriminal complaint. Before then, victims will have often received information from the Department about the status of the\ninvestigation. They might wish to confer with prosecutors about how the case is proceeding, and the CVRA extends to them a\nright to confer. 99 Similarly, while the Department is notifying victims about the services they may receive and the status of an\ninvestigation, it is important that the victims be treated fairly. The CVRA extends the right to be treated fairly. 100 Indeed, it\nwould be absurd to think that Congress wanted to permit the Justice Department to treat crime victims unfairly until criminal\ncharges have been filed.\nInstead of recognizing Congress's intent, OLC's 2011 memorandum simply cites to a series of cases in which courts concluded\nthat a victim of uncharged conduct should not be afforded statutory protections. 101 Yet none of these cases - United States v.\nTurner, 102 Searcy v. Paletz, 103 or Searcy v. Skinner 104 - provide strong support for OLC's position. Turner is a particularly\n91\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c).\n92\nId. § 10607(c)(3)(A).\n93\nId. § 10607(c)(1)(A).\n94\nId. § 10607(c)(3)(A).\n95\nId. § 10607(c)(3)(C).\n96\nId. § 10607(c)(3)(G).\n97\nId. § 10607(e)(2).\n98\nAttorney General Guidelines, supra note 52, at 7 (internal citations omitted); see also 42 U.S.C. § 10607(b).\n99\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5) (2012) (preserving \"the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case\").\n100\nId. § 3771(a)(8) (preserving \"the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy\").\n101\nOLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 6 n.6.\n102\n367 F.

Although OLC's memorandum characterizes Turner as excluding victims of uncharged conduct, 105 the magistrate\njudge adopted an inclusive reading of the statute precisely because of his reservations about the CVRA's legislative history and\nplain language. The judge suggested that \"any person who self-identifies as [a victim]\" could be presumed to qualify for\nprotection under the CVRA as a preliminary matter. 106 In fact, the line quoted by the Department is lifted out of context. The\nfull sentence reads: \"While the offense charged against a defendant can [*79] serve as a basis for identifying a \"crime victim'\nas defined in the CVRA, the class of victims with statutory rights may well be broader.\" 107\nPaletz and Skinner similarly provide scant support for the Department's position. In Skinner, a prison inmate attempted to bring\na pro se civil suit against another inmate for allegedly attacking him during incarceration. 108 In dismissing the suit in an\nunpublished decision, the district court recognized that the Government had expressly declined to bring charges against the\nother inmate and concluded that the CVRA did not create a \"mechanism to bring an action against Defendant directly.\" 109 In\nPaletz, that same inmate brought a similar pro se claim against another inmate, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the FBI, and the\nU.S. Attorney General. 110 In a parallel, unpublished decision, the district court dismissed the suit, noting that the CVRA is\ndesigned to give victims certain rights \"within the prosecutorial process against a criminal defendant.\" 111\nBecause Skinner and Paletz involve (apparently frivolous) civil suits, they say nothing about the CVRA's reach in criminal\ncases, and any language to that effect would be pure dicta. Moreover, the courts' terse analysis in both cases does not contain\nany substantive discussion of whether CVRA rights apply in criminal cases before the filing of charges. Instead, the courts\nsimply cited to language from a Second Circuit decision that stated that the CVRA does not give victims any rights against\ndefendants until those defendants have been convicted 112 - a holding clearly limited to restitution, as many other CVRA rights\nclearly apply before conviction. 113 Reviewing these two cases in an extended, published opinion, the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of Texas noted that reading these two decisions as standing for the proposition that charges must be filed\nfor CVRA rights to attach \"appears inconsistent with the CVRA recognition of certain subsection (a) rights that apply during\ninvestigation, before any charging instrument is filed.\" 114 As a result, OLC [*80] vastly overstates its position when it asserts\n103\nNo. 6:07-1389-GRA-WMC, 2007 WL 1875802 (D.S.C.

OLC'S DISTORTION OF THE CVRA'S STRUCTURE AND LEGISLATIVE HISTORY\nThe next section of OLC's memorandum maintains that the CVRA's structure and legislative history lead to the conclusion that\nthe CVRA is \"best understood\" as extending rights after charges have been filed. Here again, OLC's analysis is truncated at best\nand misleading at worst.\nOLC begins this part of its analysis by observing that some of the rights in the CVRA are limited to court proceedings. OLC\nnotes, for example, that the CVRA gives victims the \"right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding … involving the crime.\" 117 But the fact that some of the rights listed in the CVRA apply to court proceedings\nhardly means that all of the rights are to be so restricted. The federal criminal justice process includes stages that are precharging,\npost-charging, and post-conviction. It would hardly be surprising to find that a statute that Congress intended to be\n\"broad and encompassing\" 118 covered events occurring after the filing of charges.\nIndeed, OLC appears to recognize that at least three of the rights listed in the CVRA could easily apply before charges are filed:\n(1) the \"right to be reasonably protected from the accused\"; (2) the \"reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the\nGovernment in the case\"; and (3) the \"right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.\"\n119 None of these rights explicitly refer to court \"proceedings\" or other events (such as parole hearings) that necessarily occur\nafter the filing of formal charges. 120\n[*81] For purposes of this Article, it is appropriate to focus on the last two of these three rights: the right to confer and the\nright to fair treatment. The first of these three rights - the right to be reasonably protected - is already clearly extended by\nanother statute to crime victims before the filing of charges. While OLC does not acknowledge this fact, the VRRA extends the\nfirst right to crime victims, directing that a \"responsible official shall arrange for a victim to receive reasonable protection from\na suspected offender and persons acting in concert with or at the behest of the suspected offender.\" 121 Because a \"suspected\"\noffender obviously exists before the filing of criminal charges, the VRRA envisions the right to protection being provided as\nsoon as is practical after a victim suffers from the commission of a crime. Additionally, the sections of the Attorney General\nGuidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance addressing the VRRA direct that Justice Department components must provide\nreasonable protection even before the filing of criminal charges. 122 So, under the VRRA, the Justice Department should\n115\nOLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 5-6. Notably, the Department does not embrace the language from Huff found within the\nSkinner and Paletz decisions because presumably such an approach would be contrary to many of the rights found in the CVRA.\n116\nSee infra Part I.C.\n117\nOLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 6 (emphasis added) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(2)).\n118\n150 Cong.

See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (requiring prosecutors to \"make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and\naccorded, the rights described in [the CVRA]\"); United States v. Rubin, 558 F. Supp. 2d 411, 428 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (discussing potential\napplication of the right to notification of rights before charges are filed). For purposes of this Article, it is not necessary to explore this right\nin detail. If other CVRA rights apply before charges are filed, a fortiori this right does as well. If a victim has a right, presumably the victim\nshould be notified of the existence of that right.\n121\n42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(2) (2006) (emphasis added).\n122\nSee Attorney General Guidelines, supra note 52, at 7-8, 26-28.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *81\nPage 16 of 31\nalready be providing reasonable protection for a victim before an offender is indicted, regardless of how the CVRA is\ninterpreted. 123\nThe VRRA, however, does not contain a right to confer and a right to fair treatment and respect for the victim's dignity.\nTherefore, if victims are going to receive these statutory rights before trial, these rights must be found in the CVRA. With\nregard to the CVRA provision that victims have the \"reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the\ncase,\" 124 OLC contends that \"the phrase \"in the case' implies the pendency of a judicial proceeding.\" 125 To bolster its\nconclusion, OLC then cites Black's Law Dictionary, which includes among its several definitions of the word \"case\" the\ndefinition \"a civil or criminal proceeding.\" 126 But OLC does not acknowledge that Black's Law Dictionary also defines and\nexemplifies a \"case\" more broadly as a \"criminal investigation <the [*82] Manson case>.\" 127 Thus, Black's Law Dictionary\ndoes not help resolve the dispute as to which of the two meanings should be used, as there are clearly differing meanings.\nWhile OLC's reading may be a permissible one, so is a pro-victim reading.\nOLC also turns to the CVRA's legislative history to bolster its conclusion. But, here again, its analysis is misleading. OLC\nrelies on a passage from Senate floor colloquy between Senators Jon Kyl and Dianne Feinstein regarding the CVRA's scope. In\nOLC's recounting of the legislative history, the floor statements \"emphasize that the right to confer relates to the conduct of\ncriminal proceedings after the filing of charges.\" 128 For instance, OLC quotes Senator Kyl stating that \"under this provision,\nvictims are able to confer with the Government's attorney about proceedings after charging.\" 129\nThis is a truncated and deceptive description of the legislative history, so much so that Senator Kyl sent an angry letter to\nAttorney General Eric Holder complaining about the distortion. On June 6, 2011, the Senator wrote to \"express [his] surprise\nthat [OLC is] so clearly quoting [his] remarks out of context.\" 130 Senator Kyl then went on to observe that the colloquy began\nby noting that the right to confer \"is intended to be expansive.\" 131 The Senator further discussed various \"examples\" of when\nthe right to confer applied, including \"any critical stage or disposition of the case. The right, however, is not limited to these\nexamples.\" 132 It was against that backdrop that Senator Kyl gave the example of conferring about proceedings \"after\ncharging.\"\nIn his letter to Attorney General Holder, Senator Kyl also noted that he had:\nmade clear that crime victims had rights under the CVRA even before an indictment is filed. For example, … I made clear that\ncrime victims had a right to consult about both \"the case' and \"case proceedings' - i.e., both about how the case was being\nhandled before being filed in court and then later how the case was being handled in court \"proceedings.' 133\n123\nExactly what \"reasonable protection\" means, however, remains uncertain. See generally Mary Margaret Giannini, Redeeming an Empty\nPromise: Procedural Justice, the Crime Victims' Rights Act, and the Victim's Right to Be Reasonably Protected from the Accused, 78 Tenn.\nL.

L. & Criminology 59, *82\nPage 17 of 31\nSenator Kyl further commented that he had discussed the CVRA's potential application in grand jury proceedings, an\napplication that required the Act [*83] to extend rights before indictment. 134 Thus, if anything, the legislative history does\nnot support OLC's conclusion - it contradicts it. 135\nOLC should have had no doubt as to the intent of Senator Kyl and his cosponsors at the time of the Act's passage. Shortly after\nshepherding the CVRA through the Congress, Senator Kyl cowrote a law review article about the Act. 136 In that article, he\ndirectly indicated that the CVRA applies before charges are filed. Senator Kyl and his coauthors wrote:\nWhile most of the rights guaranteed by the CVRA apply in the context of legal proceedings following arrest and charging, other\nimportant rights are triggered by the harm inflicted by the crime itself. For example, the right to be treated with fairness, the\nright to be reasonably protected from the accused (who may qualify as the accused before his arrest), and the right to be treated\nwith respect for the victim's dignity and privacy each may arise without regard to the existence of legal proceedings. 137\nRemarkably, OLC cited Senator Kyl's law review article (in a footnote), but then concluded without explanation that the\nCVRA cosponsor's views were for some reason different than Congress's. 138\nOLC also appears to acknowledge that its interpretation of the CVRA could well contradict what it describes as prosecutorial\n\"good practice.\" 139 OLC noted that some Justice Department components (for example, the Environmental and Natural\nResources Division) had advocated that the right to confer should apply during pre-charging plea discussions. 140 OLC then\nacknowledged that limiting the right to confer until after formal charging could \"reduce the impact of a victim's participation in\nsubsequent court proceedings.\" 141 OLC attempted to dodge this problem by explaining: \"The question before us, though, is\nnot whether it would be advisable as a matter of good practice … for Government attorneys to confer with victims pre-charge\nwhen appropriate … .\" 142 OLC then explained that even under its narrow interpretation of the statute, \"the CVRA would still\nensure that [*84] the victim has an opportunity to be heard by the court, and by the Government, before the court accepts the\nplea.\" 143\nBut OLC failed to recognize that its interpretation of the CVRA rendered the right to be heard a nullity in many important cases\n- including, notably, the Epstein case. 144 Where prosecutors and defense attorneys work out a nonprosecution agreement that\nagreement will never be presented to a court for review. Thus, in cases where the need for victim participation may be the\ngreatest - that is, in cases where the Government is considering never filing any charges - OLC's interpretation would bar\nvictims from having any rights at all.\nEven in situations where a prosecutor works out a plea agreement, OLC's interpretation is problematic. As OLC recognizes,\nprosecutors and defense counsel commonly work out pre-indictment plea agreements (particularly in white-collar cases), under\n134\nId.\n135\nAttorney General Holder never sent a response to Senator Kyl's letter. But Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich sent a belated\nresponse. Letter from Ronald Weich, Assistant Att'y Gen., to Jon Kyl, U.S. Sen. (Nov. 3, 2011) (on file with authors). That response did not\naddress Senator Kyl's concern that his remarks were being quoted out of context.\n136\nSee generally Kyl et al., supra note 19.\n137\nId. at 594.\n138\nOLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 8 n.7.\n139\nId. at 10.\n140\nId. at 9 (citations omitted) (discussing an interdepartmental memorandum addressing this question).\n141\nId. at 10.\n142\nId.\n143\nId.\n144\nThe OLC opinion was publicly released on May 20, 2011. Perhaps not coincidentally, this release date was shortly before the Government\nfiled its response in the Epstein case.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *84\nPage 18 of 31\nwhich a defendant will plead guilty to certain charges. 145 Then, the parties jointly present to the district court a criminal\n\"information\" (that is, a recitation of the charges drafted by the prosecutor but never presented to the grand jury 146 ) and a plea\nagreement, asking the court to file the criminal information and simultaneously accept the guilty plea. As the OLC\nmemorandum acknowledges, a crime victim would have the right to object to the plea agreement, because the CVRA gives\ncrime victims the \"right to be reasonably heard\" at any public proceedings involving a plea. 147 But under OLC's interpretation\nof the CVRA, a crime victim has no right to notice of court hearings until the charges are filed. Thus, if the information and\nplea are filed simultaneously, as is often the case, two scenarios are possible. A victim could have no prior right to notice of the\nproceeding at which the plea was being accepted, or alternatively (if the act of filing the information in the course of accepting\na plea triggers a notification right), the district court would be required to stop in the middle of proceedings and ensure that\nnotification was belatedly provided. Of course, these difficulties are all avoided if the right to confer is properly construed as\nattaching before charges are filed, such as during plea negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys.\n[*85] More importantly, extending the right in this fashion will not be unduly burdensome for federal prosecutors. After the\nOLC memorandum was made public, the Department amended the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness\nAssistance to require prosecutors to make reasonable efforts toward a goal of providing victims with a meaningful opportunity\nto offer their views before plea agreements are formally reached. 148 \"In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a\ncase has been brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the filing of a charging\ninstrument with the court.\" 149 Thus, Department policy already extends pre-charging rights to victims. The CVRA should be\nunderstood as having the same scope.\nOLC also notes that the CVRA right \"to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy\" is a right\nthat could apply before charges are filed. 150 Indeed, OLC is forced to concede (as district courts have recognized) that the\n\"right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy may apply with great force during an\ninvestigation, before any charging instrument has been filed.\" 151\nOLC nonetheless maintains that the right to fairness only applies after charges have been filed. OLC relies on the canon of\nstatutory construction noscitur a sociis, meaning that words are known by their companions, 152 for its interpretation of the\nCVRA. OLC argues that because the other seven enumerated rights are limited to post-charging situations, the eighth right\nshould be as well. Of course, this argument assumes that OLC's construction of the other seven rights is correct - a point very\nmuch in dispute. 153 If, for example, the right to confer applies before charges are filed, then presumably noscitur a sociis\nwould cut the other way - the right to fairness should likewise be construed as applying before charges are filed.\nMoreover, OLC omits from its discussion of the fairness provision any assessment of the CVRA's purposes. In construing a\nstatute, a court must consider the \"purpose and context\" of the statute. 154 In describing the fairness provision, Senator Kyl\n145\nSee OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 9 (acknowledging the potential effect of the CVRA on plea negotiations).\n146\nSee Fed.

This provision is intended to direct\nGovernment agencies and employees, whether they are in the executive or judiciary branch, to treat victims of crime with the\nrespect they deserve.\" 156 OLC's failure to consider the purposes underlying the CVRA is a glaring oversight.\nOLC never attempts to explain why the CVRA's drafters would want victims to have a right to fair treatment once criminal\ncharges were filed but possess no such right before the filing of criminal charges. Clearly, many victims can and do suffer\nsecondary victimization during criminal investigations, such as when sexual assault victims are treated inappropriately by law\nenforcement agents. 157 It would contradict the purpose of preventing victim mistreatment in the criminal justice system to\nartificially limit the right to fairness to the point at which charges are filed. The right to fairness logically applies at all stages of\nthe criminal justice process.\nC. OLC'S INEFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE CVRA'S COVERAGE AND VENUE PROVISIONS\nAt the end of its memorandum, OLC finally discusses what it identifies as the two strongest arguments for construing the\nCVRA as applying before charging: the coverage provision and the venue provision. OLC acknowledges, as it must, that the\nCVRA's coverage extends to any federal employee engaged in \"the detection, investigation or prosecution of crime.\" 158 Such\nemployees \"shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights\" afforded by the\nstatute. 159 Notably, this duty applies to individuals not just in the Justice Department (where all federal prosecutors are\nlocated) but other agencies as well, such [*87] as environmental crimes investigators in the Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA). 160\nThis coverage provision would seem to answer any lingering question about whether the CVRA applies before charging. In\ndirecting that federal employees engaged in the \"detection\" and \"investigation\" of crime must respect victims' rights, Congress\nwanted broad rights extending beyond just the prosecution of a case. As the district court concluded in the Epstein case, this\nprovision \"surely contemplates pre-charge application of the CVRA.\" 161\nOLC gamely maintains, however, that Congress was simply trying to provide that federal law enforcement agents should\nprovide rights to victims when a criminal case moves to its prosecution phase. OLC noted the uncontroversial point that law\nenforcement agents \"often develop a relationship of trust with crime victims during the investigation that continues as they\nassist crime victims in negotiating active criminal proceedings.\" 162 OLC then asserted:\n155\n150 Cong.

United States, 817 F. Supp. 2d 1337, 1342 (S.D. Fla. 2011).\n162\nOLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 15.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *87\nPage 20 of 31\nGiven this continuing active role that agents typically play during criminal prosecutions, we find the fact that the CVRA assigns\nresponsibility to them, together with the attorney for the Government, to … accord them their rights under the CVRA to be\nentirely consistent with our conclusion that those rights arise only once the Government has initiated criminal proceedings. 163\nBut OLC's contorted position never explains why Congress found it necessary to break out three separate phases of the\ncriminal justice process: the \"detection,\" \"investigation,\" and \"prosecution\" of crime. If the congressional intent was simply to\ncover, for example, FBI agents or EPA agents during the post-charging phase of a case, it could have simply omitted those\nwords from the CVRA. An FBI agent, for example, would be engaged in the \"prosecution\" of the case when assisting the victim\nafter the formal filing of charges. On OLC's reading of the statute, the words \"detection\" and \"investigation\" become\nmeaningless, contrary to the well-known canon of construction verba cum effectu sunt accipienda, which means that, if\npossible, every word and every provision is to be given effect. 164\nOLC also suggests that the \"most significant\" argument supporting pre-charging application of rights is the venue provision,\nwhich allows [*88] crime victims to assert CVRA rights \"in the district court in which a defendant is being prosecuted for the\ncrime or, if no prosecution is underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred.\" 165 The Department\ncontends that this language refers quite narrowly to the \"period of time between the filing of a complaint and the initiation of\nformal charges.\" 166 In support of its position, the Department cites a Fourth Circuit case interpreting the Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel, which held that a \"prosecution\" for purposes of that Amendment does not begin when a criminal complaint is\nfiled. 167 In OLC's view, the venue provision's direction that victims should assert rights when \"no prosecution is underway\"\napplies only to the limited time between when the Government files a complaint against a defendant and some later point when\nthe \"prosecution\" actually begins. OLC notes that the filing of a complaint triggers an initial appearance, where crime victims\ncan have important interests at stake, such as the right to be heard about a defendant's release on bail. OLC believes it is only to\nsuch post-complaint, yet pre-indictment, proceedings (i.e., the initial appearance) that the venue provision's \"no-prosecutionunderway\"\nlanguage covers.\nAs a preliminary matter, OLC's interpretation of the word \"prosecution\" in the Department's narrow construction of the venue\nprovision is a twisted one, at odds with the way that term is conventionally used. The filing of a complaint is typically viewed\nas the start of a criminal prosecution. For example, the leading criminal procedure hornbook states that \"with the filing of the\ncomplaint, the arrestee officially becomes a \"defendant' in a criminal prosecution.\" 168\nMoreover, having specifically rejected the filing of the criminal complaint as the starting point for a \"prosecution\" within the\nCVRA's venue provision, OLC refuses to consider the implications of its alterative starting point: the formal filing of an\nindictment. OLC states that \"a prosecution of a felony must commence with the return of an indictment by a grand jury,\" citing\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 169 Yet OLC does not pause to recognize that, while felonies proceed by way of\nindictment, misdemeanors can proceed not only by indictment but also by complaint. 170 The CVRA draws no distinction\nbetween misdemeanor and [*89] felony offenses, broadly extending its protections to victims of any federal offense. 171\nThus, under OLC's interpretation that the filing of a complaint does not trigger the CVRA, many victims who are entitled to\n163\nId.\n164\nSee, e.g., Reiter v.

L. & Criminology 59, *89\nPage 21 of 31\nCVRA protections - i.e., victims of misdemeanor offenses prosecuted by way of complaint - will never have proper venue to\nassert those rights because, according to OLC's strained argument, no prosecution ever started in their cases.\nEven limiting the focus to felony cases, OLC misleadingly describes the Sixth Amendment case law. It is not immediately\nclear why one would look to the right to counsel to determine the breadth of the term \"prosecution\" in the Sixth Amendment.\nThe right to counsel is not the only right found in that Amendment. The Amendment also extends, for example, a right to a\nspeedy trial in all criminal \"prosecutions.\" 172 The case law on the speedy trial right makes clear that the right \"may attach\nbefore an indictment and as early as the time of arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge.\" 173\nIn any event, the right to counsel cases are quite clear in providing that a Sixth Amendment \"prosecution\" can (and often does)\nbegin well before an indictment. 174 The Supreme Court has directly held that the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel attaches\n\"at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against [a person] - \"whether by way of formal charge,\npreliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.'\" 175 Thus, under this controlling precedent, some earlier point in\ntime before indictment is the triggering point of a Sixth Amendment \"prosecution.\"\nThe cases that OLC cites are not to the contrary. It is true that some federal appeals courts have stated that the mere filing of a\ncriminal complaint does not trigger a Sixth Amendment right to counsel. 176 But there is a split of authority on this question,\nas OLC acknowledges in a footnote. 177 More importantly for purposes of this Article, the cases holding [*90] that the mere\nfiling of a complaint does not start a Sixth Amendment prosecution also make clear that a later court hearing would start such a\nprosecution. For instance, in the Fourth Circuit case cited by OLC, United States v. Alvarado, the court reasons that \"the main\nreason a law enforcement officer files [] a complaint is to establish probable cause for an arrest warrant. The criminal process is\nstill in the investigative stage, and the adverse positions of government and defendant have yet to solidify.\" 178 Relying on that\nreasoning, the Fourth Circuit refused to find that the right to counsel had attached merely because a police officer had filed a\ncomplaint to get an arrest warrant. But the Fourth Circuit distinguished that situation from \"the initiation of adversary judicial\nproceedings against the defendant.\" 179 An initial appearance would be such an adversary proceeding - i.e., it would be a\n\"prosecution\" under the Sixth Amendment. In light of this, OLC's position that the CVRA's venue provision's \"no-prosecutionunderway\"\nreference covers proceedings, such as an initial appearance, does not work.\nThe only sensible way to construe the CVRA's venue provision is to read it as conveniently dividing criminal cases into two\nphases: a prosecution phase and an earlier investigative phase when \"no prosecution is under way.\" 180 Senator Kyl, for\n172\nU.S. Const. amend.

L. & Criminology 59, *90\nPage 22 of 31\ninstance, has noted that if there are any doubts about how to construe the CVRA, this venue provision \"sweeps them away.\" 181\nOnce again, the language that Congress used leads inexorably to the conclusion that the CVRA extends rights to victims before\nthe filing of criminal charges.\nIV. When Pre-charging Rights Attach Under the CVRA\nThe zeal with which OLC argues against applying CVRA rights before charging raises the question of why it protests so much.\nAlthough OLC never articulated this concern, perhaps OLC worried that pre-charging rights would be difficult to administer.\nSuch concerns should evaporate with a workable construction of when pre-charging rights attach. In this Part, we propose such\na construction, suggesting that CVRA rights should attach when substantial evidence exists that a specific person has been\ndirectly and proximately harmed as the result of a federal crime. This approach appears to already be the method that the\nDepartment is taking, as [*91] it has extended many rights to victims before the formal filing of criminal charges as a matter\nof internal policy. 182 This approach appears to be workable, as a number of states extend rights to victims during the\ninvestigative process. 183\nA. A TEST FOR DETERMINING WHEN RIGHTS ATTACH\nAs explained in the earlier Parts of this Article, the CVRA clearly envisions that crime victims would have rights in the\ncriminal justice process before the return of indictments or the filing of criminal complaints. The question then as to how much\nearlier in the process crime victims have rights naturally arises. Does the CVRA apply one second after a federal crime has\nbeen committed? Or does it apply at some later point during an investigation?\nThis issue was nicely framed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in a securities fraud case. In the\nfirst indictment underlying the case, the charged crime did not include various victims. A later superseding indictment\nbroadened the charges to include those missing individuals. When they brought a suit under the CVRA, the court noted that\n\"quite understandably, movants perceive their victimization as having begun long before the government got around to filing\nthe superseding indictment.\" 184 The court, however, explained that there must be \"logical limits\" to crime victims' rights\nbefore the filing of charges. 185 The court noted:\nFor example, the realm of cases in which the CVRA might apply despite no prosecution being \"underway,' cannot be read to\ninclude the victims of uncharged crimes that the government has not even contemplated. It is impossible to expect the\ngovernment, much less a court, to notify crime victims of their rights if the government has not verified to at least an\nelementary degree that a crime has actually taken place, given that a corresponding investigation is at a nascent or theoretical\nstage. 186\nThe logical limits that the CVRA envisions could come from how the Justice Department interacts with criminals during the\ninvestigation of a crime. Crime victims' rights advocates are fond of saying that victims \"only want to be treated like criminals\"\n- that is, they simply want to have the same kinds of rights as criminals receive, such as the right to be notified [*92] of court\nhearings and to attend those hearings. 187 So it is instructive to notice that the Justice Department policy is to extend certain\nrights to suspected criminals during certain points in the investigative process. That policy might provide guidance on when\ncrime victims' rights would attach.\n181\nKyl et al., supra note 19, at 594.\n182\nSee, e.g., Attorney General Guidelines, supra note 52, at 41-42 (discussing the right to confer regarding plea bargains).\n183\nSee infra Part III.D.\n184\nUnited States v. Rubin, 558 F. Supp. 2d 411, 419 (E.D.N.Y. 2008).\n185\nId.\n186\nId.\n187\nSee, e.g., Cassell, supra note 15, at 1376-85 (describing the rationale underpinning state victims' rights statutes).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *92\nPage 23 of 31\nOf particular interest here is the Department's policy for grand jury subpoenas issued to a \"target\" of a criminal investigation.\nWhen such a target is subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, the Department of Justice will advise that target of his rights,\nsuch as the right to refuse to answer any question that might be incriminating. 188 The Department of Justice defines a \"target\"\nof a criminal investigation as \"a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her\nto the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is a putative defendant.\" 189\nIf the Department's investigation has coalesced sufficiently so that it can provide notice of rights to putative defendants, it\nshould likewise be in a position to provide notice of rights to that defendant's victims. Combining the Department's definition\nof \"target\" with the CVRA's coverage and definition-of-victim provisions produces a formulation whereby CVRA rights attach\nin (at least) the following circumstances:\nCVRA rights attach when an officer or employee of the Department of Justice or any other department or agency of the United\nStates engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime has substantial evidence that an identifiable person has\nbeen directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in the District of\nColumbia, and in the judgment of the officer or employee, that person is a putative victim of that offense.\nThis formulation borrows from the CVRA's coverage provision 190 to define the relevant universe of substantial evidence as\nthat in the possession of the Justice Department or other federal agencies. For instance, if state law enforcement officers are\ninvestigating a bank robbery, the fact that the robbery might also be prosecuted federally 191 does not make the teller at the\nbank a federal \"victim\" of the crime until evidence regarding the crime comes into the possession of a federal agency. The\nformulation also tracks the CVRA's definition of \"victim\" in limiting the universe of potential [*93] victims to those who have\nbeen \"directly and proximately harmed.\" 192 Finally, the formulation requires some federal officer or employee to evaluate the\nevidence and reach the conclusion that a federal offense has been committed that harmed the person in question. This\ndetermination responds to the observation by the District Court for the Eastern District of New York that the CVRA \"cannot be\nread to include the victims of uncharged crimes that the government has not even contemplated.\" 193 At the same time, such a\nformulation obviously does not require the filing of formal criminal charges, or even the preparation of formal criminal\ncharges. Instead, all that is required is for the Department to recognize that a person is a putative victim of a federal offense,\njust as all that is required for the mailing of a target letter to a subpoenaed suspected criminal, is recognition that he is a\nputative defendant in a federal case.\nB. APPLYING THE TEST TO THE EPSTEIN CASE\nTo illustrate how the test would operate, it is useful to examine the facts of the Epstein case. Applying the proposed test to that\ncase produces straightforward answers, which suggests that the test would be workable in practice.\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than thirty minor girls in his mansion, including Jane Doe Number\nOne and Jane Doe Number Two. 194 Initially, of course, his acts of abuse were secret, unknown to law enforcement. During\nthat period of time, the victims would not have had rights under the CVRA.\n188\nCriminal Resource Manual, supra note 87, § 9-11.151.\n189\nId.\n190\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(e) (2012).\n191\nId. § 2113.\n192\nSee id. § 3771(e).\n193\nUnited States v. Rubin, 558 F. Supp. 2d 411, 419 (E.D.N.Y. 2008).\n194\nAs above, see supra notes 34-41 and accompanying text, this part of the Article draws on the factual allegations made by the victims in\nthis case - allegations that Epstein has not intervened to dispute. See Jane Doe Motion, supra note 40, at 3-23.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *93\nPage 24 of 31\nIn 2006, Epstein's acts of abuse came to the attention of the Palm Beach Police Department, which began investigating the case.\n195 At this point, once again, the victims would not have had rights under the proposed CVRA test. The CVRA extends rights in\nthe federal criminal justice process. A state investigation does not trigger the CVRA (although it may trigger certain state law\nprotections, as discussed below). 196\nAt some point in 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department asked the FBI to investigate Epstein on federal sex offenses, such as\nusing a means of [*94] interstate communication in connection with sex offenses and traveling in interstate commerce for the\npurpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with minors. 197 The local police provided the FBI with information, which the\nFBI then investigated. Following an investigation, the FBI determined that the allegations of abuse against Epstein were\ncredible, and it presented the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida. In 2007, the Office\ncontacted counsel for Jeffrey Epstein and began negotiating a resolution of the case against him. 198\nUnder our proposed test, the victims would not have had CVRA rights the first moment that the FBI became aware of Epstein's\npossible commission of sex offenses. But after the FBI developed substantial evidence of those sex offenses, identified victims\nof those offenses, and presented the case to the appropriate U.S. Attorney's Office for prosecution, CVRA rights would have\nattached. Accordingly, the FBI would have been required to notify the identified victims of their rights under the CVRA (as\nwell as under the VRRA). From that point forward in the case, the victims would have had CVRA rights, such as the right to\nfair treatment and the right to confer with prosecutors. In this case, the victims would have had the right to confer with\nprosecutors about the nonprosecution agreement that they ultimately reached with Epstein. 199\nC. CURRENT DEPARTMENT POLICY ON PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS\nOne objection that might be made to the formulation offered above is that it might unduly burden federal law enforcement\nofficers and prosecutors, who would need to make judgment calls about when an investigation has coalesced to the point where\n\"victims\" are in existence, \"substantial evidence\" has been collected, and notice of rights has to be provided. Any such\nobjection would be ill-founded, though, as it does not appear that implementing such an approach would be difficult. 200\nPresumably the Justice Department has already been providing such rights in at least Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to\ncomply with the Fifth [*95] Circuit's 2008 ruling in In Re Dean, which held that the CVRA extends rights to victims before\ndefendants are charged. 201 We have not seen any reports that providing the rights has been difficult.\nPerhaps the reason for the lack of any reported difficulty is that the Department's current policy on crime victims' rights already\nrequires notices to victims during investigations. The Justice Department has promulgated the Attorney General Guidelines for\nVictim and Witness Assistance, the latest edition of which is from May 2012. The Guidelines discuss crime victims' rights\nunder both the CVRA and the earlier VRRA. Because of the OLC memorandum discussed above, the Guidelines limit CVRA\n195\nSee Probable Cause Affidavit, Palm Beach Police Department: Police Case No. 05-368(1) (May 1, 2006), available at\nhttp://goo.gl/fAPFw5; see also Statement of Undisputed Facts, Epstein v.

See Jane Doe Motion, supra note 40.\n199\nSee supra Part II.\n200\nThis Article does not discuss mass victim cases in which notice needs to be provided to hundreds of victims. But in such situations, the\nCVRA already provides for \"reasonable\" alternative procedures. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(2) (2012). The Department of Justice, for example, has\nused websites to provide notice in terrorism cases to large numbers of victims. See, e.g., United States v. Ingrassia, No. CR-04-0455ADSJO,\n2005 WL 2875220, at 4 (E.D.N.Y.

Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *95\nPage 25 of 31\nrights until after the time \"when criminal proceedings are initiated by complaint, information, or indictment.\" 202 The\nDepartment, however, provides hortatory guidance that Justice Department employees shall make \"best efforts\" to notify crime\nvictims about their CVRA rights \"as early in the criminal justice process as is feasible and appropriate.\" 203\nOf greater interest, however, is the Department's mandatory policy regarding notification regarding crime victim services under\nthe VRRA. The Guidelines explain how \"Department responsibilities to crime victims begin as soon as possible after the\ndetection of a crime at which they may be undertaken without interfering in the investigation.\" 204 The Guidelines then direct\nthe appropriate \"responsible official\" to provide crime victims with \"information about services available to them.\" 205 This\ninformation must be provided at \"the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at which it may be done without interfering\nwith an investigation.\" 206\nThe Department appears to have little difficulty implementing this requirement. Evidence of this fact comes from the Justice\nDepartment itself, which responded to the letter from Senator Kyl discussed earlier questioning why the Department was not\napplying the CVRA before charges were filed. 207 In its response, the Department noted that OLC had issued an opinion that\nthe CVRA did not extend rights before the formal filing of charges. 208 \"Even so,\" the Department explained, \"the new AG\nGuidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make [*96] reasonable efforts to notify identified\nvictims of, and consider victims' views about, prospective plea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument\nwith the court.\" 209\nThe Department also noted that it provided extensive pre-charging notifications to victims under the VRRA:\nPursuant to the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA), the Department identifies victims and provides to them\nservice referrals, reasonable protection, notice concerning the status of the investigation, and information about the criminal\njustice process prior to the filing of any charges. The Department's investigative agencies provide such services to thousands of\nvictims every year, whether or not the investigation results in a federal prosecution. 210\nQuantifying the scope of this undertaking with regard to one federal investigative agency, the Department explained:\nThe [FBI] alone reports that it provided more than 190,000 services to victims during the past fiscal year [FY 2011], including\ncase status updates, assistance with compensation applications and referrals, and counseling referrals. From sexual assaults in\nIndian Country to child pornography and human trafficking to mass violence and overseas terrorism, FBI victim specialists\nprovide much-needed immediate and ongoing support and information to victims. The FBI addresses victim safety issues when\nneeded, providing on-scene response and crisis intervention services in thousands of investigations. With regard to sexual\nassault victims, FBI personnel arrange for and often accompany victims to forensic sexual assault medical examinations and\nprovide assistance with HIV/STD testing. 211\n202\nAttorney General Guidelines, supra note 52, at 8.\n203\nId. at 35.\n204\nId. at 26 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 10607(b) (2006)).\n205\nId. at 29 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 10607(b)(2)).

Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *96\nPage 26 of 31\nIn view of the Department's existing notifications and provision of services before charges are filed under the VRRA, it is hard\nto conceive how any viable claim could be made that it would be difficult to provide similar rights under the CVRA. The four\nrights that would be potentially in play before charging would be the right to reasonable protection, the right to fair treatment,\nand the right to confer with prosecutors, along with the predicate right to notice of these rights. 212 The VRRA already requires\nthe Department to provide reasonable protection, so this would not be an expanded obligation. 213 Similarly, the Guidelines\nalready require prosecutors to confer with victims about plea agreements (the most common situation where victims want to\nconfer), so it is hard to imagine how extending this right would create any undue burden. 214 Additionally, the right to \"fair\ntreatment\" could only be a problem if the Department [*97] wanted to treat victims unfairly. Given its repeated and professed\ncommitment to crime victims, here too this obligation should not be burdensome. And finally, with regard to providing notice\nof CVRA rights to victims, the fact that the Department currently provides notice of VRRA rights indicates that it should not be\ndifficult to provide notice of CVRA rights as well.\nIndeed, it is possible that the Department's notification letters under the VRRA already include this information. Interestingly,\nin the Epstein case, the FBI notified Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe Number Two that they had rights in the criminal\njustice process. As early as June 7, 2007 - more than three months before it concluded a nonprosecution agreement with\nEpstein - the U.S. Attorney's Office sent a notice to Jane Doe Number One stating \"your case is under investigation.\" 215 The\nnotice also informed Jane Doe Number One that \"as a victim and/or witness of a federal offense, you have a number of rights.\"\n216 Among the rights that the U.S. Attorney's Office told Jane Doe that she possessed was \"the reasonable right to confer with\nthe attorney for the United States in the case.\" 217 Of course, she would not have had those rights if she was not covered by the\nCVRA. The FBI therefore apparently assumed that the CVRA already applied in the Epstein case. It was only later, when the\nmatter went into litigation, that the Department of Justice reversed course. This change in course underscores the problems\narising out of the OLC memorandum and the Department's current interpretation of the CVRA.\nD. STATE LAW EXTENSION OF PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS\nThe focus of this Article so far has been crime victims' rights in the federal system. But in concluding, it is instructive to note\nhow a number of states offer parallel rights for crime victims, including the right to confer with prosecutors. In fact, several\nstates have extended such rights prior to formally filing of charges against defendants - without reported difficulty, so far as we\nare aware. This confirms our inference that extending CVRA rights to crime victims before the formal filing of criminal\ncharges is both feasible and desirable.\nA general overview of state laws illustrates the broad protections afforded to victims in state criminal justice systems. Nearly\ntwo-thirds of states have adopted constitutional provisions to protect victims throughout [*98] the criminal justice process.\n218 Moreover, every state has adopted a statute that either enforces its constitutional amendment or creates independent\nstatutory rights for crime victims. 219 As a result, state legislatures and state employees have attempted to give victims a voice\nin the criminal justice process across the country.\n212\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(1), (5), (8), (c)(1) (2012).\n213\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(2) (2006).\n214\nSee Attorney General Guidelines, supra note 52, at 41-42.\n215\nLetter from A.

L. & Criminology 59, *98\nPage 27 of 31\nNotably, while the strength of these rights varies from state to state, 220 nearly forty states require the prosecuting attorney to\nnotify or confer with the victim regarding plea negotiations. 221 Several jurisdictions involve the victim in the charging\ndecision. 222 In some states, law enforcement and prosecutors must involve the victim at any \"critical\" 223 or \"crucial\" 224\nstage of the criminal proceeding; and in a minority of jurisdictions, the judge must ascertain whether the prosecutor has\nafforded the victim statutory protections prior to accepting a plea agreement. 225\nThe general contours of state provisions suggest that several state governments have recognized the value in informing victims\nof their rights and involving them in the criminal process prior to the formal filing of charges. 226 Indeed, a brief look at the\nstatutory protections illustrates the extent to which states have attempted to afford protections to victims long before the formal\nfiling of charges.\n[*99] For example, Arizona has adopted a constitutional amendment and statutes that expansively protect victims. Under\nArizona law, the definition of victim hinges on whether a criminal offense has been committed, and the term \"criminal offense\"\nis defined as \"conduct that gives a peace officer or prosecutor probable cause to believe\" a crime has occurred. 227 In short, a\nvictim's status does not hinge on the formal filing of charges but rather on the criminal conduct itself. 228 Arizona law\nenforcement personnel must give information to victims describing their rights as soon as possible, even if formal charges have\nnot yet been filed, and a victim may request that the prosecutor discuss the disposition of the case, including \"a decision not to\nproceed with a criminal prosecution, dismissal, plea, or sentence negotiations and pretrial diversion programs.\" 229 A victim\nmay even pursue some rights if counts are dismissed. 230 Arizona courts have also permitted victims to invoke their rights in\nthe context of civil forfeiture proceedings. 231\nHawaii's victims' rights statute illustrates how a state has defined the term \"case\" more expansively than the limited definition\nadvocated by the Department in order to facilitate victim participation. By statute in Hawaii, victims must, upon request, be\ninformed of \"major developments\" in any felony case. 232 Along a similar vein, the prosecuting attorney must consult or\n220\nSee generally Dean G. Kilpatrick et al., Nat'l Inst. of Justice, U.S. Dep't of Justice, The Rights of Crime Victims - Does Legal Protection\nMake a Difference? (1998), available at http://goo.gl/EzH61S.\n221\nSee Peggy M.

Confinement 21, 64 & n.168 (1999) (citing to victims' rights statutes in Connecticut,\nIllinois, and Michigan, among others). Unfortunately, as some commentators have noted, the notice and conferral provisions in some states\nare ambiguous, and the absence of case law precludes a definitive understanding of the reach of the right in some jurisdictions. See LaFave et\nal., supra note 168, § 21.3(f), at 1041-42; see also, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. § 74-7333(a)(5) (2002) (\"The views and concerns of victims should\nbe ascertained and the appropriate assistance provided throughout the criminal process.\"). In some jurisdictions, the ambiguous use of an\nillustrative list could be read as suggesting that a particular right, such as conferral, hinges on formal charges. See, e.g., Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §\n421.500(6) (LexisNexis Supp. 2012) (requiring consultation on \"disposition of the case including dismissal, release of defendant pending\njudicial proceedings, any conditions of release, a negotiated plea, and entry into a pretrial diversion program,\" but failing to define\n\"disposition\" or \"case\").\n222\nSee Tobolowsky, supra note 221, at 59-60.\n223\nE.g., La.

L. & Criminology 59, *99\nPage 28 of 31\nadvise the victim about any plea negotiations. 233 Interestingly, however, the Hawaii legislature defined \"major developments\"\nas \"arrest or release of the suspect by the police, case deferral by the police, referral to the prosecutor by the police, rejection of\nthe case by the prosecutor, preliminary hearing date, grand jury date, trial and sentencing dates, and the disposition of the case.\"\n234 The usage of the term \"case\" and the plain language of the provisions demonstrate that victims in the State of Hawaii are\nentitled to a notification right and a possible consultation right long before formal charges are filed.\n[*100] Other states also expressly extend rights before the filing of charges. Colorado guarantees rights at \"all critical stages\nof the criminal justice process[,]\" which includes both the filing of charges and the decision to not file charges. 235 In Missouri,\nvictims have the right:\non charged cases or submitted cases where no charge decision has yet been made, to be informed by the prosecuting attorney of\nthe status of the case and of the availability [of different forms of compensation and assistance] and of any final decision by the\nprosecuting attorney not to file charges. 236\nIn New Jersey, officials typically send a letter informing the victim \"that the case has been referred to the prosecutors' office\nand explains and offers the services available from the country office of victim-witness advocacy.\" 237 Subsequent letters to\nthe victim ensure that the victim has notice of a series of decisions long before indictment, 238 and the office actively solicits\ninformation in order to \"help the prosecutor's office decide whether or not to prosecute a case.\" 239 Along a similar vein, the\nMassachusetts legislature included a provision that makes it clear that nothing should prevent a prosecutor from providing\nvictim services to persons injured by the commission of a crime, even though a complaint or indictment has not yet been\nissued. 240\nIn addition to extending rights before the filing of charges, several states require consultation before the prosecutor reaches a\nplea agreement with the defendant. For example, Idaho's statute provides that a victim must be given an opportunity \"to\ncommunicate with the prosecution in criminal or juvenile offenses, and be advised of any proposed plea agreement by the\nprosecuting attorney prior to entering into a plea agreement in criminal or juvenile offenses involving crimes of violence, sex\n228\nUnder Arizona law, the \"rights and duties that are established by this chapter arise on the arrest or formal charging of the person or\npersons who are alleged to be responsible for a criminal offence against a victim.\" Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-4402(A) (2010) (emphasis\nadded).\n229\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-4419(A) (2010).\n230\nSee Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-4402.01(A).\n231\nIt appears, however, that the criminal proceeding may have been parallel to the civil forfeiture proceeding. See State v. Lee, 245 P.3d 919,\n923-24 (Ariz. Ct.

Rev. Stat. § 24-4.1-302.5(1)(f) (2012) (limiting\nconferral right, in particular, to later stages of a criminal proceeding). Despite these limitations on the conferral right, victims retain the ability\nto be heard at any hearing involving a plea. See id. § 24-4.1-302.5.\n236\nMo. Ann.

In addition to the\nrights similar to the federal legislation, New Jersey law provides for the right \"to be advised of case progress and final disposition and to\nconfer with the prosecutor's representative so that the victim may be kept adequately informed … .\" Id. § 52:4B-36(k).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J.

For example, Louisiana constrains the conferral right to criminal matters \"in which formal charges have been filed by\nthe district attorney's office.\" 245 Yet, unlike the federal CVRA, this statute specifically excludes pre-charging situations. And,\nin any event, despite Louisiana's limitation on a particular right within the statute, the legislature in this state still often saw fit\nto provide the victim with notification rights, even in the absence of the formal filing of charges. 246\nVery few state courts have ever considered the precise issue of whether conferral rights may attach prior to the formal filing of\ncharges. This is likely caused by the fact that, unlike the federal statute, many state statutes fail to provide the victim with a\nprocedural mechanism for challenging the conduct of prosecutors or law enforcement agencies. 247 However, in rare cases,\nstate courts have implicitly recognized that a meaningful interpretation of victims' rights should include some rights prior to\nfiling.\nFor example, a Connecticut court concluded that a company injured by the delinquent act of a minor was entitled to\ninformation about the case [*102] contained in a police file in a civil proceeding, even though it appears that there was little\nindication that criminal charges had been filed. 248 Similarly, the South Carolina Supreme Court, while limiting the ability of\nthe victim to challenge the conduct of a prosecutor, concluded that the same rights under the state constitution must attach prior\nto the formal filing of an indictment. 249 Other courts have even permitted a victim to recover compensation or reparations for\nunindicted or acquitted conduct. 250\n238\nSee Office of Victim-Witness Advocacy, supra note 237, at 4 (including pre-grand jury remand, administrative dismissal, grand jury\nremand, grand jury dismissal, and indictment returned).\n239\nId. at 26 (describing victim involvement at grand jury and arraignment stages of the proceeding).\n240\nSee Mass. Ann. Laws ch. 258B, § 2 (LexisNexis 2004).\n241\nIdaho Code Ann. § 19-5306(1)(f) (2004). As in the case of most of the state statutes, the Idaho statute is not without ambiguity. A\ndifferent provision within the statute makes the notification right contingent \"upon the filing of a criminal complaint or juvenile petition … .\"\nId. § 19-5306(2).\n242\nInd. Code Ann. § 35-40-5-3(b) (West 2012); id. § 35-40-1-1 (failing to define \"case\").\n243\nSee, e.g., Md. Const. art. 47(b) (\"In a case originating by indictment or information filed in a circuit court, a victim of crime shall have the\nright to be informed … .\").\n244\nIn Delaware, for example, the statute contains an additional limitation in the conferral provision that is noticeably absent from the duty\nimposed on law enforcement to provide information about the victim's rights to that victim. Compare Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, § 9405 (2007),\nand Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, § 9411 (2007) (imposing additional requirements after the Attorney General commences the prosecution), with\nDel.

Rev. 255, 300-\n23 (discussing problems with remedies in victims' rights statutes).\n248\nSee In re James B., Jr., 714 A.2d 735 (Conn. Super. Ct. 1998).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *102\nPage 30 of 31\nIn other words, while few state judiciaries have addressed the precise timing of state crime victims' rights, those that have\naddressed the question have typically found that the rights do extend to pre-charging situations.\nDespite the relative dearth of state court cases, it is worth noting that most state statutes unequivocally provide for notification\nrights early in the criminal process. 251 For example, the Illinois statute imposes a limited duty on law enforcement agencies to\nkeep victims informed of the status of an investigation until the accused is apprehended or the agency discontinues the\ninvestigation. 252 Similarly, law enforcement agencies in Iowa must keep the victim apprised of the investigation \"until the\nalleged assailant is apprehended or the investigation is closed.\" 253 Michigan's statute requires law enforcement to provide\ninformation within a mere twenty-four hours of contact between the agency and the victim. 254\nIn sum, while state law on crime victims' rights before charging is not fully developed, what law exists tends to support the\nposition that crime victims deserve rights before the formal filing of charges. This law fits the long-standing trend in states\ntoward expanding protections for crime [*103] victims. 255 The decision by state legislators to extend notification or\nconferral rights to crime victims demonstrates an express recognition that crime victims' meaningful participation in the\ncriminal justice process may involve granting those victims rights before indictment.\nConclusion\nCrime victims have important rights at stake in the criminal justice process, even before prosecutors formally file criminal\ncharges. It is hardly surprising, therefore, to find that a federal law that Congress in fact designed to create \"broad and\nencompassing\" rights for victims protects victims during a criminal investigation. As this Article has explained, interpreting the\nCVRA to cover crime victims during the pre-charging phase of a case is consistent with the statute's purposes, text, legislative\nhistory, and interpretive case law. And state criminal justice systems also appear to be moving in that direction.\nThe Justice Department's contrary interpretation seems unlikely to prevail when challenged. The CVRA signals a paradigm\nshift in the way that crime victims are to be treated, at least within the federal criminal justice system. Before enactment of the\nlaw, federal investigators and prosecutors might have been able to keep victims at arm's length, refusing to confer with them\nabout the case and otherwise ignoring or even mistreating them during the process. But those days are over. The CVRA\npromises victims that they now have the right to confer with prosecutors and the right to be treated fairly while their cases are\ninvestigated. It is time for the Department of Justice to recognize and embrace that new reality.\nJournal of Criminal Law & Criminology\n249\nSee Ex parte Littlefield, 540 S.E.2d 81, 85 (S.C. 2000).\n250\nSee Kimberly J. Winbush, Annotation, Persons or Entities Entitled to Restitution as \"Victim\" Under State Criminal Restitution Statute, 92\nA.L.R. 5th 35, 35 (2001) (recounting cases in which unnamed victims were entitled to restitution).\n251\nSee, e.g., Minn. Stat. Ann. § 611A.0315(a) (West 2009) (requiring a prosecutor to \"make every reasonable effort to notify a victim of\ndomestic assault … or harassment that the prosecutor has decided to decline prosecution of the case\" but providing the right to participate in\nproceedings to circumstances in which the offender has been charged).\n252\nSee 725 Ill.

Michigan's conferral right is particularly ambiguous, because the notification\nrequirement imposed upon the prosecuting attorney contains a time limitation (after arraignment), but the legislature did not include an\nexpress time limitation on the conferral right. See Mich. Comp.
