This latter group reminds me of the ancient Greek\nGods: they are very powerful, but sometimes flawed, as their\ninterventions in the world did not always work as planned.\nWe are getting closer to the Twilight of the Gods, a time when\nthey are either running out of ammunition, or the ability to use\nit without causing even more problems. If so, the private\nsector will have to recover on its own. The consequence of\nthese cross-currents: we invest in equities, but hold 10%-15%\nless than what we normally would at this point of the business\ncycle, and are positioning for a single-digit year on equities.\nHigh Yield,\nLeveraged\nLoans,\nStructured\nCredit, 10%\nEmerging\nMarket FX, 5%\nCore Bonds,\n8%\nInflation, 2% Cash, 3%\nPublic equity,\n36%\nJPM US\nBalanced\nModel Portfolio\nDiversified\nHedge Funds,\nPrivate equity,\n6%\n5%\nReal Estate,\nSingle Strategy\n3% Hard Assets,\nHedge Funds,\n4%\n18%\nSource: J.P. Morgan Private Bank, as of July 2011.\nThese portfolios may not be suitable for all investors & are shown for\nillustrative purposes only\nPROFITS\nThe primary (and perhaps sole) justification for carrying the levels of risk shown above relates to corporate profits. As\nshown below, profit margins have reached levels not seen in decades. The challenge, which we have discussed many times\nbefore: what is driving these margins 2 ? One useful way to deconstruct profits is to measure them from peak to peak, and\nanalyze what changed. As shown in the first chart, S&P 500 profit margins increased by ~1.3% from 2000 to 2007. There are a\nlot of moving parts in the margin equation, but as shown in the second chart, reductions in wages and benefits explain the\nmajority of the net improvement in margins. This trend has continued; as we have shown several times over the last two\nyears, US labor compensation is now at a 50-year low relative to both company sales and US GDP (see EoTM April 26, 2011).\nS&P 500 pre-tax margins\nExcluding financials, large-cap proxy used before1976\n16%\n15%\n14%\n1.3% increase\n13%\n12%\n11%\n10%\n9%\n8%\n7%\n6%\n1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010\nSource: Corporate reports, Empirical Research Partners.

Why is US labor compensation so low? The lingering excess labor supply from the recession is one reason, but the 2\nbillion people in Asia joining the global labor force over the last two decades is another. As shown on next page, EM wages for\nproduction workers remain well below US levels 3 . Another factor helping profit margins: increased US imports of intermediate\ngoods from Asia. As shown in the accompanying chart, imports from Asia have been rising, and over the same time frame,\nAsian import prices only increased at around 1% per year.\n1 We use these portfolios to manage assets for clients who give us discretion over their funds, and to provide recommendations to those who\ndon’t. This is one of several model portfolios we manage globally. They differ by jurisdiction, risk tolerance, tax treatment, eligibility to\npurchase vehicles designated for qualified purchasers, and other factors.\n2 Empirical Research Partners does more work on corporate profits than anyone else we’ve seen. This section draws on research that Mike\nGoldstein at Empirical shared with us at a recent investment committee meeting.\n3 A recent study from Boston Consulting Group maintains that the gap between China and the US will close in 5 years. BCG believes that\nwith Chinese wages growing at 15%-20% per year, US wages growing at 3% per year, higher productivity in the US and rising shipping and\ninventory costs, the China advantage will disappear within the decade. Some of these assumptions seem aggressive to apply in perpetuity.\n1\nJuly 11, 2011\nTopics: Portfolios, US corporate profits and the Twilight of the Gods (in the US, Europe, China and the IEA)\nHourly compensation for production workers\nShare of US rate, 2005 vs. 2011\n30%\n25%\n2005\n2011E\nShare of US imports of intermediate goods from China,\nMalaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, percent\n14%\n12%\nTo summarize, we expect today’s margins to last a while longer, since relative costs won’t converge overnight. But we are not\ninclined to pay a high multiple for them, given their reliance on weak labor compensation, which in turn requires large\ngovernment transfers. The good news: markets are not applying high multiples right now, which is why we own the equities\nwe do. However, questions about the large but shrinking public sector toolkit knock 10%-15% off of our equity\nallocations, compared to where we would normally expect to be 2 years after a recession. We walk through 4 instances\nof this below, as it relates to US fiscal policy, oil prices, Chinese inflation and the European periphery.\nTwilight of the Gods, part 1: Limited room for fiscal policy to invigorate the US recovery\nHere’s what we know for sure about the US Federal debt ceiling debate:\n�\n�\n�\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\nTaiwan Mexico China Philippines\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Empirical Research Partners.\nThe government is facing the unappealing task of having to increase the Federal debt ceiling above 100% of GDP for the\nfirst time since the end of WWII, and only the second time since the debt ceiling was established in 1917\nThe government has already run out of money from traditional sources. As shown below, since May 16, 2011, the US\nTreasury has been raiding the cash, securities and borrowing capacity of government employee retirement and other funds.\nOf $270 billion of such balances which existed in May, around 75% has already been used up. There’s not much leeway\nleft, which is why the government will probably run out of money some time in August.\nThe debate about the existing Federal debt is the lesser of two problems. As shown on the following page, the present value\nof unfunded entitlement obligations (e.g., future debt) dwarfs the existing debt. That’s why there’s so much talk about a\ndeal to stabilize the long term trajectory of the budget deficit.\nThe rest is all speculation. The table on the next page shows the revenue and spending factors in play. It’s too early to know\nwhat kind of deal will be crafted. We believe that the deal with be composed of 80% spending cuts and 20% revenue/tax\nincreases (rather than 50-50), and will be closer to $2 trillion than $4 trillion. While it’s possible that another dose of fiscal\nstimulus will be built into the debt ceiling agreement, it might not be that large, and its impact could easily be offset by a\nsubdued consumer response due to expectations of higher taxes in the long run (e.g., Ricardian equivalence).\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\n2000 2007 2010\nSource: UN Comtrade, Empirical Research Partners.\nStatutory debt limit and debt subject to limit\nTrillions of gross debt, USD\n18\nGross debt/GDP\n16\n14\n12\n10\n68%\nDebt limit\n69%\nProposed increase\n99%\n86%\n78%\n73%\nDebt\n87%\n109%\n8\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nSource: US Department of the Treasury, J.P.

They\nhave a lot of ammunition to do so; government-controlled oil inventories are at least 1.5 billion barrels, and so far, all they have\ndone is authorize the release of 60 million barrels. The timeline suggests that oil markets began focusing on the release of the\nSPR after the Libyan shutdown, the lack of a sufficient OPEC supply response, and weak economic data in the US. As shown\nbelow, oil prices have been rising since the announcement of the supply increase. Are IEA members committed to doing it\nagain if oil prices reach their May levels?\nBrent oil price and timeline of SPR release\nUSD/bbl\n130\n125\n120\n115\n110\n105\n100\n95\n90\nJan-11 Feb-11 Mar-11 Apr-11 May-11 Jun-11 Jul-11\nSource: Bloomberg.\nThe problem for the IEA is that the tightness in oil markets\nis not just a sudden supply shock. As shown in the bottom\nchart we first published in March, there was not much slack\neven before the Libyan shutdown, and oil demand is expected\nto rise 1-2 mm bpd as the developed and emerging world\ncontinue to grow. One of our colleagues used to work at the\nIEA, and in a recent piece 4 , argued that the impact of the SPR\nrelease will be limited to Q3 2011, and that upside oil price\nrisks to 2012 have increased. Why? The SPR release came at a\ntime when OPEC tanker traffic made it clear that producing\ncountries were having problems meeting prior pledges: “As\nsuch, it is difficult to conclude anything except that there is\nlittle or no spare capacity in the oil market”. If that’s the case,\nfuture interventions may not have a lasting impact either.\nA\nB\nC\nD E F\nG\n[A] May 2: Advisors lay out SPR release plan to Obama\n[B] May 6: Obama calls Abdullah (S.A.) and Sabah al-Ahmad (Kuw)\nto discuss SPR release\n[C] May 19: IEA urges OPEC to increase production or else member\nnations are prepared to use “all tools” to protect global economy\n[D] May 27: Former White House energy advisor predicts IEA SPR\nrelease\n[E] June 8: OPEC does not agree on production increase\n[F] June 17: Obama authorizes IEA-SPR release feasibility study\n[G] June 23: SPR release announced\nPost-Libya OPEC spare capacity running out\nMillions of barrels per day\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\nPre-crisis OPEC\nspare capacity\nPre-crisis \"real\"\nOPEC spare\ncapacity\nSource: J.P.

Perhaps; Premier Wen has stated that the country’s efforts to control inflation have worked, that price stability is in an\nacceptable range, and that it will drop steadily from here. But last week’s headline inflation release of 6.4% hit a three year\nhigh, and it is not clear to us that China is about to end its various inflation control policy measures.\nIn favor of Wen’s argument, food inflation has been a large contributor, some of which should be transitory. Blue-ear pig virus\n(PRRS) killed hundreds of thousands of pigs in 2010, which affected this year’s supply (2006 was worse). As shown below,\npork prices have soared, but should come down if the supply situation normalizes. [Note: a “Strategic Pork Reserve” can be\nreleased to mitigate price increases]. However, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization 5 , new virulent strains of\nthe virus have a fatality rate of 20% (even higher for piglets), and what is considered a temporary supply shock may be more\npermanent. Chinese pig facilities have the highest animal densities in the world, contributing to the spread of disease to 25 of\nChina’s 33 provinces. Antibiotics have proven ineffective, and once one pig gets the disease, it tends to spread to the entire\nherd in 7-10 days. China has vaccinated 100 million of its 500 million pigs, but existing vaccines do not prevent infection, they\nonly slow the rate of transmission to other pigs.\n8\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nSource: China Ministry of Commerce.\nA separate issue is that China is doing a lot more to control the supply of money than the cost of money. As shown below, there\nhave been a lot more increases in bank reserve requirements than interest rate increases. Deposit rates are still negative in real\nterms, and bank reserve requirements only affect banks, and not the shadow banking system, which is growing in China.\nChina reserve requirement ratio for large banks\nPercent\n23%\n21%\n19%\n17%\n15%\n13%\n11%\n9%\n7%\n5%\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nSource: People's Bank of China.\nChinese wholesale pork price\nRMB per kilogram\n26\nForward-looking manufacturing surveys have declined and interbank lending rates (Shibor) have surged, so it’s clear that the\ntightening steps are working. But private sector credit is still growing in China, and real estate prices are still rising. The\nbottom line is that the substantial stimulus provided by Chinese and other Asian policymakers in the wake of the\nrecession has not yet been adequately withdrawn, and that more steps will need to be taken to do so.\n24\n22\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\nBegining of\nPRRS outbreak\nChina one-year deposit rate still negative in real terms\nPercent, year on year\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\nDeposit rate\n-2%\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nSource: People's Bank of China, National Bureau of Statistics.\nCPI\n5 “Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virulence jumps and persistent circulation in Southeast Asia”, Food and\nAgriculture Organization Emergency Prevention System, Issue number 5, 2011.\n4\nJuly 11, 2011\nTopics: Portfolios, US corporate profits and the Twilight of the Gods (in the US, Europe, China and the IEA)\nTwilight of the Gods, part 4:\nIs Europe just trying to save its banking system, or is a more comprehensive move towards Federalism underway?\nI expected French proposals on a Greek debt exchange to begin to spell out the sacrifices private sector investors will have to\nmake as Greece spirals towards insolvency. As shown below, I was wrong about that. French proposals don’t entail any\nspecific commitments by banks, and are merely non-binding indications of interest by banks to roll over debt at some point in\nthe future as it matures. If bank rollovers of Greek debt or Greek government asset sales fall short of the mark, the EU and IMF\nappear committed to providing Greece with funds to pay off maturing debt anyway. The EU taxpayer continues to foot the bill.\nBinding commitments from EU banks to roll over\nGreek debt as per French posposal, Euros in billions\nThis chart intentionally left blank since there are\nno binding committments at all\nItaly gross debt to GDP\nPercent\n120%\n110%\n100%\n90%\n80%\nLittle progress on debt\nreduction despite 20 years of\nprimary budget surpluses\n70%\n60%\nMaastricht limit\nSo to be clear, the Twilight of the Gods has not arrived in Europe, since the EU appears determined to spend more money\nto prevent a sovereign default. I see why they are worried about contagion. The latest signs: Portugal downgraded to junk;\nlong-term debt of 3 French banks put on downgrade watch; and stress in European unsecured interbank markets 6 , now affecting\nItalian banks which rely heavily on them. Italian bank and insurance company holdings of their own government bonds is 2x-\n3x higher than the rest of the region, creating the potential for a vicious circle if something goes wrong. Italian banks are bettercapitalized\nand have higher quality assets than banks in other European countries, since Italy did not experience a large boombust\nin residential property, or a consumer debt binge. However, like Greece and Ireland, Italy’s debt/GDP ratio is above 100%,\nand the country suffers from low growth (the lowest in the world from 2000-2010 other than Zimbabwe and Haiti, according to\nthe Economist). Think about this: Italy has run a primary budget surplus (i.e. ex-interest payments) every year since 1992,\nbut still hasn’t been able to bring its debt ratios below 100% of GDP. Italy was making progress, but the recession derailed\nthem, leaving Italy with the same elevated debt burden they started with 20 years ago.\nI believe that eventually, the constituency of the European Monetary Union will have to change. However, my colleagues in\nJ.P. Morgan Securities’ economics group disagree. They believe that the EMU will survive intact, and believe that Europe is\nmoving towards Federalism, with this crisis as the basis for putting it in place. I have been a skeptic of this idea; how can a\nregion use the structural failures of its current model as an excuse for expanding it, particularly when popular support for\nthe European project is at such low levels 7 ? The history of Europe does show that revolutions are often imposed from above\n(e.g., Peter the Great, Otto von Bismarck, Napoleon) rather than below, so anything is possible. If my colleagues are right,\nlosses suffered by holders of Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt may be a lot less than what’s priced in right now. I don’t have\nthe conviction to make that kind of call, at least not yet; geopolitical investing is a very hard thing to do. We remain cautious\non Europe; are underinvested in government debt, corporate credit and equities across the region; and expect a Greek\nsovereign debt restructuring within the next 18 months (see chart from “Five Stages of Greece”, June 30, 2011 ).\nMichael Cembalest\nChief Investment Officer\n50%\n1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010\nSource: International Monetary Fund.\n6 JP Morgan’s Prime Money Market Fund is indicative of industry concerns about a liquidity squeeze. The fund holds no Greece, Portugal,\nIreland or Spain. Its Italy holdings are less than 2% of the fund, and the portfolio manager does not expect to roll them when they mature.\n7 A 2010 Eurobarometer Poll showed very low readings on whether “Membership in the EU is a good thing”. More recently, the centre-left\nFoundation for European Progressive Studies polled EU civil servants (a pro-EU constituency if there ever was one) and found that a\nmajority believe that “the European model has entered into a lasting crisis”. Only a quarter of respondents saw the EU as having evolved\npositively over the last decade, or believe that the December 2009 Lisbon Treaty has had a positive effect.\n5\nJuly 11, 2011\nTopics: Portfolios, US corporate profits and the Twilight of the Gods (in the US, Europe, China and the IEA)\nThe material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.
