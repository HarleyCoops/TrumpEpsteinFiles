But his \ntreatment of the Wall Street executives involved in the financial meltdown \nwas far less confrontational. \nby Jesse Eisinger \nProPublica, March 12, 2017, 6:22 p.m. \n1 Comment Print Print \nsearch Follow ProPublica \nEmail Updates by email \n_____Preet Bharara, then U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, at Trump \nTower in November 2016 (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) \nAfter his election in 1968, President Richard Nixon asked Robert Morgenthau, the US \nAttorney for the Southern District of New York, to resign. Morgenthau refused to leave \nvoluntarily, saying it degraded the office to treat it as a patronage position. \nNixon's move precipitated a political crisis. The president named a replacement. Powerful \npoliticians lined up to support Morgenthau. Morgenthau had taken on mobsters and power \nbrokers. He had repeatedly prosecuted Roy Cohn, the sleazy New York lawyer who had \nbeen Senator Joe McCarthy's right-hand man. (One of Cohn's clients and protégés was a \nyoung New York City real estate developer named Donald Trump.) When Cohn complained \nthat Morgenthau had a vendetta against him, Morgenthau replied, \"A man is not immune \nfrom prosecution merely because a United States Attorney happens not to like him.\" \nMorgenthau carried that confrontational attitude to the world of business. He pioneered the \nSouthern District's approach to corporate crime. When his prosecutors took on corporate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019845 \nfraud, they did not reach settlements that called for fines, the current fashion these days. \nThey filed criminal charges against the executives responsible. \nBefore Morgenthau, the Department of Justice focused on two-bit corporate misdeeds \nPonzi schemes and boiler room operations. Morgenthau changed that. His prosecutors went \nafter CEOs and their enablers___the accountants and lawyers who abetted the frauds or \nlooked the other way. \"How do you justify prosecuting a nineteen-year old who sells drugs \non a street corner when you say it's too complicated to go after the people who move the \nmoney?\" he once asked. \nMorgenthau's years as United States Attorney were followed by political success. He was \nelected New York County District Attorney in 1974, the first of seven consecutive terms for \nthat office. \nThere are parallels between Morgenthau, and Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the \nSouthern District who was fired by President Trump this weekend. \nLike Morgenthau, the 48-year old Bharara leaves the office of US Attorney for the Southern \nDistrict celebrated for taking on corrupt and powerful politicians. Bharara prosecuted two of \nthe infamous \"three men in a room\" who ran New York state: Sheldon Silver, the \nDemocratic speaker of the assembly and Dean Skelos, the Republican Senate majority \nleader. \nHe won convictions of a startling array of local politicians, carrying on the work of the \nMoreland Commission, an ethics inquiry created and then dismissed by New York's Gov. \nAndrew Cuomo. (This weekend, Bharara cryptically tweeted that \"I know what the \nMoreland Commission must have felt like,\" a suggestion that he was fired as he was \npursuing cases pointed at Trump or his allies.) \nBut the record shows that Bharara was much less aggressive when it came to confronting \nWall Street's misdeeds. \nPresident Obama appointed Bharara in 2009, amid the wreckage of the worst financial crisis \nsince the Great Depression. He inherited ongoing investigations into the collapse, including \na probe against Lehman Brothers. \nHe also inherited something he and his young charges found more alluring: insider-trading \ncases against hedge fund managers. His office focused obsessively on those. At one point, \nthe Southern District racked up a record of 85-0 in those cases. (Appeals courts would later \nthrow out two prominent convictions, infuriating him and dealing blows to several other \ncases.) \nHedge funds are safer targets. The firms aren't enmeshed in the global financial markets in \nthe way that giant banks are. Insider trading cases are relatively easy to win and don't \naddress systemic abuses that helped bring down the financial system. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019846 \nEven there his record was more mixed than is popularly understood. As Sheelah Kolhatkar \ndemonstrates in her propulsive and riveting \"Black Edge,\" when it came to bringing his \nbiggest whale to justice, Steve Cohen of SAC Capital, the Southern District blinked. They \ndid not charge him, only securing a guilty plea from his firm. \nPresent and former prosecutors say Bharara did not give much emphasis to investigations \narising from the financial meltdown, an approach shared by his boss, Attorney General Eric \nHolder. Justice Department insiders say many of those inquiries withered not because they \nwere unpromising, but because they had little support. \nBharara missed an opportunity by not bringing any significant criminal charges against \nindividuals in the wake of the collapses of Lehman, investment bank Merrill Lynch, the \ninsurer AIG, the mortgage securities and collateralized debt obligation businesses, or the \nmyriad public misrepresentations from bank CEOs about their finances. \nBharara and senior officials in Washington argue that there were no criminal cases to file \nafter the 2008 crisis. But the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan did pursue significant civil \ncases against the banks for their mortgage activities, cases that had to proove misconduct by \nthe \"preponderance of the evidence.\" And DOJ did win guilty pleas from the banks \nthemselves, an indication that prosecutors might have been able to charge individuals for \ntheir part in crimes their institutions had acknowledged. Academics who studied those years, \nincluding Columbia's Tomasz Piskorski and James Witkin and Chicago's Amit Seru found  \nwidespread patterns of fraud in the mortgage business. \nThe exception makes this failure all the more puzzling. As I detailed in 2014, Bharara's \noffice brought one case for misconduct during the financial crisis____against a mid-level \nbanker. Prosecutors charged Kareem Serageldin of Credit Suisse with overseeing traders \nwho knowingly misrepresented the value of mortgage securities. Serageldin pleaded guilty \nand went to prison. \nSerageldin's colleagues in the industry and others familiar with Credit Suisse found it hard \nto believe that he was the only person involved in that particular fraud. \nBharara's reluctance to pursue senior executives was seen in other investigations of big \nbanks. His office wrested a $1.7 billion fine from JPMorgan Chase over its complicity in the \nBernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, but it brought no charges against individual bankers. \nOne odd aspect of his tenure was the Southern District's willingness to defer to other \njurisdictions when it came to Wall Street cases. \nHistorically, the SDNY has been the leading enforcers of securities laws, nicknamed the \n\"sovereign district\" for its propensity to grab corporate fraud cases from elsewhere on the \nflimsiest of jurisdictional pretexts. Under Bharara, the southern district let other U.S. \nattorneys claim investigations into residential mortgage-backed securities, the instruments at \nthe heart of the financial crisis. Those other offices were not nearly as versed in complex \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019847 \nfinancial cases as their colleagues in Manhattan. In addition, Bharara's office ceded post-\nfinancial crisis investigations into foreign exchange and global interest rate manipulation to \nprosecutors working from the Justice Department's headquarters. \nLike Morgenthau, Bharara was a prominent figure in the New York landscape, given to \nwell-orchestrated press conferences and memorable sound bites. Like Morgenthau, he did \nnot leave office quietly, even thought the president has a longstanding right to name his own \nU.S. attorneys. And like Morgenthau, he may try to parlay his martyrdom into elective \noffice. \nBut if he runs on his record of convictions, as prosecutors often do, voters might want to \nconsider as well the list of possible targets he never pursued. \nLike this story?
