This\nfinal rule sets forth the Board’s review\nof and responses to comments on the\nproposal and incorporates any changes\nmade to the rule in response to those\ncomments.\nThe Board believes that many\nemployees protected by the NLRA are\nunaware of their rights under the statute\nand that the rule will increase\nknowledge of the NLRA among\nemployees, in order to better enable the\nexercise of rights under the statute. A\nbeneficial side effect may well be the\npromotion of statutory compliance by\nemployers and unions.\nThe final rule establishes the size,\nform, and content of the notice, and sets\nforth provisions regarding the\nenforcement of the rule.\nDATES: This rule will be effective on\nNovember 14, 2011.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nLester A. Heltzer, Executive Secretary,\nNational Labor Relations Board, 1099\n14th Street, NW., Washington, DC\n20570, (202) 273–1067 (this is not a tollfree\nnumber), 1–866–315–6572 (TTY/\nTDD).\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\nI. Background on the Rulemaking\nThe NLRA, enacted in 1935, is the\nFederal statute that regulates most\nprivate sector labor-management\nrelations in the United States. 1 Section\n7 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 157,\nguarantees that\nEmployees shall have the right to selforganization,\nto form, join, or assist labor\norganizations, to bargain collectively through\nrepresentatives of their own choosing, and to\nengage in other concerted activities for the\npurpose of collective bargaining or other\n1 Labor-management relations in the railroad and\nairline industries are governed by the Railway\nLabor Act, 45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.\nmutual aid or protection, and shall also have\nthe right to refrain from any or all such\nactivities[.]\nIn Section 1, 29 U.S.C. 151, Congress\nexplained why it was necessary for\nthose rights to be protected:\nThe denial by some employers of the right\nof employees to organize and the refusal by\nsome employers to accept the procedure of\ncollective bargaining lead to strikes and other\nforms of industrial strife or unrest, which\nhave the intent or the necessary effect of\nburdening or obstructing commerce[.] * * *\n* * * * *\nExperience has proved that protection by\nlaw of the right of employees to organize and\nbargain collectively safeguards commerce\nfrom injury, impairment, or interruption, and\npromotes the flow of commerce by removing\ncertain recognized sources of industrial strife\nand unrest, by encouraging practices\nfundamental to the friendly adjustment of\nindustrial disputes arising out of differences\nas to wages, hours, or other working\nconditions, and by restoring equality of\nbargaining power between employers and\nemployees.\n* * * * *\nIt is declared to be the policy of the United\nStates to eliminate the causes of certain\nsubstantial obstructions to the free flow of\ncommerce and to mitigate and eliminate\nthese obstructions when they have occurred\nby encouraging the practice and procedure of\ncollective bargaining and by protecting the\nexercise by workers of full freedom of\nassociation, self-organization, and\ndesignation of representatives of their own\nchoosing, for the purpose of negotiating the\nterms and conditions of their employment or\nother mutual aid or protection.\nThus, Congress plainly stated that, in its\njudgment, protecting the rights of\nemployees to form and join unions and\nto engage in collective bargaining would\nbenefit not only the employees\nthemselves, but the nation as a whole.\nThe Board was established to ensure\nthat employers and, later, unions\nrespect the exercise of employees’ rights\nunder the NLRA. 2\nFor employees to fully exercise their\nNLRA rights, however, they must know\nthat those rights exist and that the Board\nprotects those rights. As the Board\nexplained in its Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking (NPRM), 75 FR 80410, it\nhas reason to think that most do not. 3\n2 The original NLRA did not include restrictions\non the actions of unions; those were added in the\nLabor-Management Relations (Taft-Hartley) Act of\n1947, 29 U.S.C. 141 et seq., Title I.\n3 The Board cited three law review articles in\nwhich the authors contended that American\nworkers are largely unaware of their NLRA rights,\nthat the Board can take action to vindicate those\nrights, and that this lack of knowledge stands in the\nway of employees’ effectively exercising their\nrights. Peter D. DeChiara, ‘‘The Right to Know: An\nArgument for Informing Employees of Their Rights\nunder the National Labor Relations Act,’’ 32 Harv.\nJ. on Legis. 431, 433–434 (1995); Charles J.

Rev. 101, 107\n(1993); Morris, ‘‘NLRB Protection in the Nonunion\nWorkplace: A Glimpse at a General Theory of\nSection 7 Conduct,’’ 137 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1673, 1675–\n1676 (1989). 75 FR at 80411.\n4 Id.\n5 The Board requires that employees be notified\nof their NLRA rights in only the following narrow\ncircumstances: (1) For the three working days\nbefore a Board-conducted representation election,\nthe employer is required to post a notice of election\nincluding a brief description of employee rights; see\n29 CFR 103.20. (2) When an employer or a union\nhas been found to have violated employee rights\nunder the NLRA, it is required to post a notice\ncontaining a brief summary of those rights. (3)\nBefore a union may seek to obligate newly hired\nnonmember employees to pay dues and fees under\na union-security clause, it must inform them of\ntheir right under NLRB v. General Motors, 373 U.S.\n734 (1963), and Communications Workers v. Beck,\n487 U.S. 735 (1988), to be or remain nonmembers\nand that nonmembers have the right to object to\npaying for union activities unrelated to the union’s\nduties as the bargaining representative and to obtain\na reduction in dues and fees of such activities.\nCalifornia Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224, 233\n(1995), enfd. sub nom.

The same\nnotice must also be given to union members if they\ndid not receive it when they entered the bargaining\nunit.

(4) When an employer voluntarily\nrecognizes a union, the Board has required that the\nemployer must post a notice informing employees:\n(i) That the employer recognized the union on the\nbasis of evidence that it was designated by a\nmajority of the unit employees; (ii) the date of\nrecognition; (iii) that all employees, including those\nwho previously signed cards for the recognized\nunion, have the right to be represented by a labor\norganization of their choice, or no union at all; (iv)\nthat within 45 days of the date of the notice a\ndecertification or rival petition, supported by 30\npercent or more of the unit employees, may be filed\nwith the Board and will be processed to an election;\nand, (v) that if no petition is filed within 45 days,\nthe recognition will not be subject to challenge for\na reasonable period to allow the employer and\nunion to negotiate a collective-bargaining\nagreement. Dana Corp., 351 NLRB 434 (2007).\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54007\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nFederal labor and employment laws in\nnot requiring employers routinely to\npost notices at their workplaces\ninforming employees of their statutory\nrights. 6 Given this common practice of\nworkplace notice-posting, it is\nreasonable for the Board to infer that a\nposting requirement will increase\nemployees’ awareness of their rights\nunder the NLRA. 7 Further support for\nthat position is President Obama’s\nrecent Executive Order 13496, issued on\nJanuary 30, 2009, which stressed the\nneed for employees to be informed of\ntheir NLRA rights. Executive Order\n13496 requires Federal contractors and\nsubcontractors to include in their\nGovernment contracts specific\nprovisions requiring them to post\nnotices of employees’ NLRA rights. On\nMay 20, 2010, the Department of Labor\nissued a Final Rule implementing the\norder effective June 21, 2010. 75 FR\n28368, 29 CFR part 471.\nAfter due consideration, the Board\nhas decided to require that employees of\nall employers subject to the NLRA be\ninformed of their NLRA rights.\nInforming employees of their statutory\nrights is central to advancing the\nNLRA’s promise of ‘‘full freedom of\nassociation, self-organization, and\ndesignation of representatives of their\nown choosing.’’ NLRA Section 1, 29\nU.S.C. 151. It is fundamental to\nemployees’ exercise of their rights that\nthe employees know both their basic\nrights and where they can go to seek\nhelp in understanding those rights.\nNotice of the right of self-organization,\nto form, join, or assist labor\norganizations, to bargain collectively, to\nengage in other concerted activities, and\nto refrain from such activities, and of\nthe Board’s role in protecting those\nstatutory rights is necessary to effectuate\nthe provisions of the NLRA.\nThe Board believes that the workplace\nitself is the most appropriate place for\ncommunicating with employees about\ntheir basic statutory rights as employees.\nCf. Eastex, Inc. v. NLRB, 437 U.S. 556,\n574 (1978) (‘‘[T]he plant is a particularly\nappropriate place for the distribution of\n[NLRA] material.’’).\nAccordingly, and pursuant to its\nrulemaking authority under Section 6 of\nthe NLRA, the Board proposed a new\nrule requiring all employers subject to\nthe NLRA to post a copy of a notice\nadvising employees of their rights under\n6 See, e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e–10(a); Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act, 29 U.S.C. 627; Family and\nMedical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. 2601, 2619(a); Fair\nLabor Standards Act, 29 CFR 516.4 (implementing\n29 U.S.C. 211). 75 FR 80411.\n7 As set forth in the NPRM, two petitions were\nfiled to address this anomaly. 75 FR 80411.\nthe NLRA and providing information\npertaining to the enforcement of those\nrights. 75 FR 80411. For the reasons\ndiscussed more fully below, the Board\ntentatively determined that the content\nof the notice should be the same as that\nof the notice required under the\nDepartment of Labor’s notice posting\nrule, 29 CFR part 471. Id. at 80412. Also,\nas discussed at length below, the Board\nproposed that failure to post the notice\nwould be found to be an unfair labor\npractice—i.e., to interfere with, restrain,\nor coerce employees in the exercise of\ntheir NLRA rights, in violation of\nSection 8(a)(1) of the NLRA. Id. at\n80414. The Board also proposed that\nfailure to post the notice could lead to\ntolling of the 6-month statute of\nlimitations for filing unfair labor\npractice charges, and that knowing and\nwillful failure to post the notice could\nbe considered as evidence of unlawful\nmotive in unfair labor practice cases. Id.\nThe Board explained that the burden of\ncompliance would be minimal—the\nnotices would be made available at no\ncharge by the Board (both electronically\nand in hard copy), and employers\nwould only be required to post the\nnotices in places where they\ncustomarily post notices to employees;\nthe rule would contain no reporting or\nrecordkeeping requirements. Id. at\n80412. Finally, the Board expressed its\nposition that it was not required to\nprepare an initial regulatory flexibility\nanalysis of the proposed rule under the\nRegulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601\net seq., and that the notice posting\nrequirement was not subject to the\nPaperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.\n3501 et seq. Id. at 80415–80416.\nThe Board invited comments on its\nlegal authority to issue the rule, the\ncontent of the notice, the requirements\nfor posting the notice, the proposed\nenforcement scheme, the definitions of\nterms in the proposed rule, and on its\npositions concerning the Regulatory\nFlexibility Act and the Paperwork\nReduction Act. The Board stated that\ncomments would be accepted for 60\ndays following the publication of the\nNPRM in the Federal Register, or until\nFebruary 22, 2011. The Board received\n6,560 comments by February 22.\nHowever, many late-filed comments\nwere also submitted, and the Board\ndecided to accept all comments that it\nreceived on or before March 23. 8\n8 March 23, 2011 was the date that the Board\ndownloaded all of the electronic and (pdf. versions\nof) hard copy comments it had received from\nhttp://www.regulations.gov and subsequently\nuploaded into a text analytics tool for coding and\nreview.\nA few commenters submitted their comments in\nboth electronic and hard copy form.

The majority of comments, as\nwell as Board Member Hayes’ dissent,\noppose the rule or aspects of it; many\nopposing comments contain suggestions\nfor improvement in the event the Board\nissues a final rule. Many comments,\nhowever, support the rule; a few of\nthose suggest changes to clarify or\nstrengthen the rule. The Board wishes to\nexpress its appreciation to all those who\ntook the time to submit thoughtful and\nhelpful comments and suggestions\nconcerning the proposed rule. 9\nAfter careful consideration of the\ncomments received, the Board has\ndecided to issue a final rule that is\nsimilar to that proposed in the NPRM,\nbut with some changes suggested by\ncommenters. The most significant\nchange in the final rule is the deletion\nof the requirement that employers\ndistribute the notice via email, voice\nmail, text messaging or related\nelectronic communications if they\ncustomarily communicate with their\nemployees in that manner. Other\nsignificant changes include\nclarifications of the employee notice\ndetailing employee rights protected by\nthe NLRA and unlawful conduct on the\npart of unions; clarification of the rule’s\nrequirements for posting notices in\nforeign languages; allowing employers\nto post notices in black and white as\nwell as in color; and exemption of the\nU.S. Postal Service from coverage of the\nrule. The Board’s responses to the\ncomments, and the changes in the rule\nand in the wording of the required\nnotice of employee rights occasioned by\nthe comments, are explained below. (In\nhis dissent, Board Member Hayes raises\na number of points that are also made\nin some of the comments. The Board’s\nresponses to those comments should be\nunderstood as responding to the dissent\nas well.) 10\ncomments received are included in the numbers\ncited in text above, those numbers overstate\nsomewhat the number of individuals, organizations,\netc. that submitted comments.\n9 Many comments charge that the Board is issuing\nthe rule for political reasons, to encourage and\nspread unionism, to discourage employers and\nemployees from engaging in direct communication\nand problem solving, to drive up union\nmembership in order to retain agency staff, and\neven to ‘‘line [its] pockets.’’ The Board responds\nthat its reasons for issuing the rule are set forth in\nthis preamble.\n10 The Board majority’s reasoning stands on its\nown. By its silence, the majority does not adopt any\ncharacterization made by the dissent of the\nmajority’s rationale or motives.\n54008 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nII. Authority\nSection 6 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 156,\nprovides that ‘‘The Board shall have\nauthority from time to time to make,\namend, and rescind, in the manner\nprescribed by the Administrative\nProcedure Act [5 U.S.C. 553], such rules\nand regulations as may be necessary to\ncarry out the provisions of this Act.’’ As\ndiscussed in detail below, the Board\ninterprets Section 6 as authorizing the\nrule.\nA. The Board’s Section 6 Rulemaking\nAuthority\nNumerous comments dispute the\nBoard’s statutory authority to enact the\nproposed rule. Many note the fact that\nthe Board’s rulemaking is constrained\nby Congressional intent as evidenced in\nits enabling statute. For instance, the\nAmerican Trucking Association quotes a\nNinth Circuit case explaining that\nSection 6 ‘‘does not authorize the Board\nto promulgate rules and regulations\nwhich have the effect of enlarging its\nauthority beyond the scope intended by\nCongress,’’ 11 and similarly, the Motor &\nEquipment Manufacturers Association\nasserts, ‘‘A regulation cannot stand if it\nis contrary to the statute.’’ 12 The Board\nagrees that it may not exercise its\nrulemaking authority in a way contrary\nto that intended by Congress, but for the\nreasons discussed below it also does not\nbelieve that it has done so in this rule.\nSeveral comments assert that because\nNLRA Section 6 is written in general,\nrather than specific, terms, the Board is\nnot empowered to enact the proposed\nrule. For example, Associated Builders\nand Contractors argues that ‘‘the lack of\nexpress statutory language under\nSection 6 of the NLRA to require the\nposting of a notice of any kind ‘is a\nstrong indicator, if not dispositive, that\nthe Board lacks the authority to impose\nsuch a requirement * * *.’ ’’ 13 And the\nHeritage Foundation likewise argues\nthat the Board’s reliance upon its\ngeneral Section 6 rulemaking authority\ndoes not suffice to meet the\nAdministrative Procedure Act’s\nrequirement that the NPRM must\n11 Gen. Eng’g, Inc. v. NLRB, 341 F.2d 367, 374\n(1965).\n12 Citing United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642,\n673 (1997). However, the Supreme Court actually\nheld there that an agency’s interpretation of its\nenabling statute must be given ‘‘controlling weight\nunless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly\ncontrary to the statute.’’ (quoting Chevron U.S.A.\nInc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,\n844 (1984)). There, the Court upheld the rule and\nfound it was not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly\ncontrary to the statute.\n13 Quoting Member Hayes’ dissent, 75 FR 80415.\n‘‘reference the legal authority under\nwhich the rule is proposed.’’ 14\nThe Board believes that these\ncomments are in error because the\ncourts’ construction of other statutes’\ngeneral rulemaking authority, as well as\nSection 6 in particular, fully support its\nreading of this statutory provision. In\nfact, earlier this year, the Supreme Court\nissued a decision in Mayo Foundation\nfor Medical Education and Research v.\nUnited States 15 (discussed more fully\nbelow), unanimously reaffirming the\nprinciple that a general grant of\nrulemaking authority fully suffices to\nconfer legislative (or binding)\nrulemaking authority upon an agency.\nEven prior to Mayo, a long line of both\nnon-NLRA and NLRA cases supported\nreading Section 6 in the manner\nsuggested by the Board. Over forty years\nago, in Thorpe v. Housing Authority, 16\nthe Supreme Court found that the\nexpansive grant of rulemaking authority\nin Section 8 of the Housing Act was\nsufficient to grant legislative rulemaking\npower to the Department of Housing\nand Urban Development. The Court\nfurther noted that ‘‘[s]uch broad rulemaking\npowers have been granted to\nnumerous other federal administrative\nbodies in substantially the same\nlanguage.’’ 17 A few years later, in\nMourning v. Family Publication\nServices, 18 the Court reaffirmed its\nstance in Thorpe:\nWhere the empowering provision of a\nstatute states simply that the agency may\n‘make * * * such rules and regulations as\nmay be necessary to carry out the provisions\nof this Act,’ we have held that the validity\nof a regulation promulgated thereunder will\nbe sustained so long as it is ‘reasonably\nrelated to the purposes of the enabling\nlegislation.’ 19\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s lead,\nkey circuit decisions then extended the\n14 See 5 USC 553(b)(2). For this conclusion, the\nHeritage Foundation cites Global Van Lines, Inc., v.\nICC, 714 F.2d 1290, 1297–98 (5th Cir. 1983). But\nGlobal Van Lines did not find that a general\nstatement of authority can never meet the APA’s\nrequirements to specify the legal authority for the\nrule. Instead, the Fifth Circuit held that that portion\nof the APA is violated when an agency chooses to\nrely on additional statutory provisions in support\nof its rule for the first time on appeal, and those\ngrounds do not appear elsewhere in the\nadministrative record. See id. at 1298–99. Here, in\ncontrast, the grounds for the Board’s rule are clearly\nlaid out in subsection B, Statutory Authority,\nbelow.\n15 131 S.Ct. 704, 713–14 (2011).\n16 393 U.S. 268 (1969).\n17 Id. at 277 n. 28 (citations omitted). The\nrulemaking grant there at issue provided that HUD\nmay, ‘‘from time to time * * * make, amend, and\nrescind such rules and regulations as may be\nnecessary to carry out the provisions of this Act,’’\nid. at 277, quite similar to Section 6 of the NLRA.\n18 411 U.S. 356 (1973).\n19 Id. at 369 (quoting Thorpe, 393 U.S. at 280–81).\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 19:02 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nnotion that broad grants of rulemaking\nauthority conveyed legislative\nrulemaking power. 20 Although the\nBoard had historically chosen to make\npolicy by adjudications, the Supreme\nCourt, consistent with the non-NLRA\ncase law, used a pair of Board\nenforcement cases to unanimously\nemphasize the existence of the Board’s\nlegislative rulemaking authority, NLRB\nv. Wyman-Gordon Co. 21 and NLRB v.\nBell Aerospace. 22\nIn 1991, after the Board enacted a rule\ninvolving health care units, the\nSupreme Court unanimously upheld\nthat rule in American Hospital\nAssociation v. NLRB. 23 The Supreme\nCourt found that that the general grant\nof rulemaking authority contained in\nSection 6 of the Act ‘‘was\nunquestionably sufficient to authorize\nthe rule at issue in this case unless\nlimited by some other provision in the\nAct.’’ 24 As in AHA, there is no such\nlimitation here on the Board’s authority\nto enact the proposed Rule, as explained\nfurther below. As Senator Tom Harkin\nand Representative George Miller 25\nemphasized in their comment, the\nSupreme Court in AHA examined ‘‘the\nstructure and the policy of the NLRA,’’\nin order to conclude:\nAs a matter of statutory drafting, if\nCongress had intended to curtail in a\nparticular area the broad rulemaking\nauthority granted in § 6, we would have\nexpected it to do so in language expressly\ndescribing an exception from that section or\nat least referring specifically to the section. 26\nThus, the Court could not have been\nclearer that unless the Board is\n‘‘expressly’’ limited in some manner,\nSection 6 empowers the Board to make\n‘‘such rules and regulations as may be\nnecessary to carry out the provisions of\nthis Act.’’ This point was underscored\n20 Nat’l Ass’n. of Pharm.

United States, affirmed this\nkey principle that a broad grant of\nstatutory rulemaking authority conveys\nauthority to adopt legislative rules. 28\nMayo concerned in part the question of\nhow much deference a Treasury\nDepartment tax regulation should\nreceive. In Mayo, an amicus argued that\nthe Treasury Department’s\ninterpretation should receive less\ndeference because it was issued under a\ngeneral grant of rulemaking authority, as\nopposed to an interpretation issued\nunder a specific grant of authority. 29\nThe Court responded by first explaining\nits earlier holding in U.S. v. Mead, that\nChevron deference is appropriate ‘‘when\nit appears that Congress delegated\nauthority to the agency generally to\nmake rules carrying the force of law,\nand that the agency interpretation\nclaiming deference was promulgated in\nthe exercise of that authority.’’ 30 Then,\nin significant part, the Court observed:\nOur inquiry in that regard does not turn on\nwhether Congress’s delegation of authority\nwas general or specific.\n* * * * *\nThe Department issued the full-time\nemployee rule pursuant to the explicit\nauthorization to ‘‘prescribe all needful rules\nand regulations for the enforcement’’ of the\nInternal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 7805(a). We\nhave found such ‘‘express congressional\nauthorizations to engage in the process of\nrulemaking’’ to be ‘‘a very good indicator of\ndelegation meriting Chevron treatment.’’ 31\nAnd so, all nine members of the\nSupreme Court agreed on the following\nkey principle: an express, albeit general,\ngrant of rulemaking authority is fully\nsufficient for an agency to receive\nChevron deference for its rulemaking. It\nfollows that a broad grant of rulemaking\nauthority will suffice for the agency to\nengage in legislative rulemaking in the\nfirst place. Thus, the Supreme Court’s\n27 Statement of Donald A.

Ct. at 713–14 (emphasis added\nand citations omitted).\nrulings continue to fully support a broad\nconstruction of Section 6.\nDisputing this conclusion, ALG\nasserts that Section 6 was intended to be\nused ‘‘primarily’’ for procedural\nrulemaking, and cites a Senate report\nfrom the Wagner Act’s legislative\nhistory. That Senate report explains:\n‘‘[i]n no case do the rules have the force\nof law in the sense that criminal\npenalties or fines accrue for their\nviolation, and it seems sufficient that\nthe rules prescribed must be ‘necessary\nto carry out the provisions’ of the\nact.’’ 32 The Board disagrees. The cited\nlanguage merely proclaims the obvious,\nthat no criminal penalties or fines\naccrue for violating the Board’s rules.\nHowever, laws such as the NLRA that\ndo not impose criminal penalties or\nfines for their violation can also have\nthe ‘‘force of law’’ (which is perhaps\nwhy the Senate report used the limiting\nphrase ‘‘in the sense of’’). The Supreme\nCourt has previously recognized that\nfinal Agency orders under Sections 10\n(e) and (f) of the Act, despite their nonself\nenforcing nature, have ‘‘the force\nand effect of law.’’ 33 So too, do the\nBoard’s rules have the force and effect\nof law, as held by the Supreme Court in\nAHA. 34\nSeveral comments discuss whether\nBoard Rule 103.20, which mandates the\nposting of an election notice in a\nworkplace three working days prior to a\nrepresentation election, should be\nconsidered analogous to the proposed\nrule. The United Food and Commercial\nWorkers International Union (UFCW)\ncomments that the election rule is, like\nthe proposed rule, only minimally\nburdensome and further noted that it\nhas never been challenged. 35 ALG\ndisagrees that the election rule should\nbe considered analogous here, because\nalthough in the election context a notice\nposting is the most feasible means to\ninform employees about an upcoming\nelection that is occurring at a specific\n32 See Comparison of S. 2926 (73d Congress) and\nS. 1958 (74th Congress) 24 (Comm.

The Board\nagrees with the UFCW that posting a\nnotice is a minimally burdensome way\nto ensure that employees receive certain\ninformation, although obviously, the\nproposed notice will reach many more\nemployers over a much longer period of\ntime than do election notices. And\nALG’s acknowledgment that a notice\nposting in the workplace is in fact\nsometimes the most feasible means to\ninform employees of important\ninformation supports the Board’s belief,\nexplained below, that workplace notice\nposting is a more efficient way of\ninforming employees of their NLRA\nrights than relying on information\navailable on the Internet.\nA few comments argue that the Board\nis a law enforcement agency only, and\nshould not be engaging in rulemaking\nfor that reason. One comment asserts\nthat ‘‘Congress did not intend to\n‘‘empower the NLRB to be a rulemaking\nbody, but rather an investigatory/\nenforcement agent of the NLRA.’’ 36 The\nBoard responds that by enacting Section\n6, Congress plainly and explicitly\nintended to, and did, ‘‘empower the\nNLRB to be a rulemaking body.’’ And,\nas shown above, AHA conclusively\nfound that the Board is empowered to\nuse its rulemaking powers, as the Court\nhad previously indicated in Wyman-\nGordon and Bell Aerospace. 37\nA joint comment submitted by\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin and Sam Batkins\nargues against the Board’s assertion of\nSection 6 authority here by asserting\nthat ‘‘the Supreme Court has\ncircumscribed NLRB rulemaking in the\npast: ‘The deference owed to an expert\ntribunal cannot be allowed to slip into\na judicial inertia which results in the\nunauthorized assumption by an agency\nof major policy decisions properly made\nby Congress.’ ’’ However, that comment\nneglects to provide the citation for that\nquotation, American Ship Building Co.\nv.

As explained in subsection B,\n36 Comment of Manufacturers’ Association of\nSouth Central Pennsylvania.\n37 In National Petroleum Refiners Ass’n v. FTC,\n482 F.2d 672 (D.C. Cir. 1973), the court rejected the\nargument that the FTC’s prosecutorial functions\nrendered it unsuitable for issuing rules. By way of\nexample, it noted that the NLRB is similar to the\nFTC in its methods of adjudication and\nenforcement, but the Supreme Court had repeatedly\nencouraged the Board to utilize its rulemaking\npowers. Id. at 684.\n38 380 U.S. 300, 318 (1965).\n54010 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nStatutory Authority, below, the Board\nbelieves that it has been Congressionally\nauthorized to make this regulatory\ndecision in the interests of carrying out\nthe provisions of the Act.\nMany comments argue that the Board\nshould heed the use of the word\n‘‘necessary’’ in Section 6. For instance,\nthe Portland Cement Association\ncomments that Section 6 requires the\nBoard to demonstrate that: (1) The\nspecific rule being proposed is, in fact,\nnecessary, and (2) the adoption of the\nproposed rule will carry out one or more\nspecific provisions of the Act. 39 The\nBoard believes, for the reasons\nexpressed in subsection C, Factual\nSupport, below, that the requisite\nshowing of necessity has been made.\nAnd, as explained below, the adoption\nof the proposed rule is consistent with\nSection 1 and will help effectuate\nSections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the NLRA.\nThe Board, however, disagrees with\nthe Motor & Equipment Manufacturers\nAssociation’s assertion based upon the\ncase of West Virginia State Board of\nEducation v. Barnette 40 that the Board\nneeds to show ‘‘a grave and immediate\ndanger’’ before enacting a rule. First,\nthat case held that that very rigorous\nstandard of review is required only\nwhere a First Amendment freedom is\nalleged to have been infringed. The\nCourt further noted that where the First\nAmendment is not implicated, the\ngovernment may regulate an area so\nlong as it has a ‘‘rational basis’’ for\ndoing so. As explained in subsection B,\nStatutory Authority, below, this rule\ninfringes upon no First Amendment\ninterests, and consequently, the rule\nshould be judged on a standard similar\nto the ‘‘rational basis’’ test laid out in\nBarnette. It was in fact just such a\ndeferential standard which the Supreme\nCourt used to examine the Board’s\nhealth care rule in AHA. There, the\nCourt found that even if it read Section\n9 to find any ambiguity, it still would\nhave deferred to the Board’s ‘‘reasonable\ninterpretation of the statutory text,’’ and\nfound the Board authorized under\nSections 6 and 9 to enact the health care\nbargaining unit rule at issue. 41 No\n‘‘grave and immediate danger’’ was\nfound to be required prior to the Board\nenacting that rule. This ruling was also\nconsistent with the Supreme Court’s\nearlier holdings in Thorpe and\nMourning, in which regulations\npromulgated under broadly phrased\ngrants of authority needed to be only\n39 See also comment of Americans for Limited\nGovernment, citing to AFL–CIO v. Chao, 409 F.3d\n377, 391 (D.C.

The Board’s Statutory Authority To\nIssue This Rule\nThe National Labor Relations Act\ndoes not directly address an employer’s\nobligation to post a notice of its\nemployees’ rights arising under the Act\nor the consequences an employer may\nface for failing to do so. However, as\nstated, NLRA Section 6 empowers the\nBoard to promulgate legislative rules ‘‘as\nmay be necessary to carry out the\nprovisions’’ of the Act. 29 U.S.C. 156. A\ndetermination of necessity under\nSection 6 made by the Board, as\nadministrator of the NLRA, is entitled to\ndeference. See Ragsdale v. Wolverine\nWorld Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 86 (2002).\nFurthermore, even in the absence of\nexpress rulemaking authority, ‘‘the\npower of an administrative agency to\nadminister a congressionally created\n* * * program necessarily requires the\nformulation of policy and the making of\nrules to fill any gap left, implicitly or\nexplicitly, by Congress.’’ Morton v. Ruiz,\n415 U.S. 199, 231 (1974). Under the\nwell-known test articulated by the\nSupreme Court in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), courts will\ndefer to the Board’s reasonable\ninterpretation of a gap left by Congress\nin the NLRA.\nAn examination of the provisions of\nthe whole law demonstrate how the\nnotice-posting rule is a legitimate\nexercise of both legislative rulemaking\nauthority under Section 6 and implied\ngap-filling authority under Chevron, 467\nU.S. at 843. Section 1 of the NLRA\nexplains that Congress deliberately\nchose the means of ‘‘encouraging the\npractice and procedure of collective\nbargaining’’ and ‘‘protecting the exercise\nof workers of full freedom of\nassociation, self-organization, and\ndesignation of representatives of their\nown choosing’’ in order to combat the\nsubstantial burdens on commerce\ncaused by certain employer and labor\nunion practices as well as by the\ninherent ‘‘inequality of bargaining\npower between employees * * * and\nemployers.’’ 29 U.S.C. 151. 43 Section 7\n42 Mourning, 411 U.S. at 369 (quoting Thorpe, 393\nU.S. at 280–81).\n43 These regulations are entirely compatible with\nthe national labor policy, as expressed in Section\n1, ‘‘to eliminate the causes of certain substantial\nobstructions to the free flow of commerce and to\nmitigate and eliminate these obstructions when\nthey have occurred.’’ 29 U.S.C. 151 (fifth\nparagraph). As explained below, the Board’s ability\nto ‘‘eliminate’’ the causes of labor strife and\ndepressed wage rates, ‘‘which have the intent or\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\ntherefore sets forth the core rights of\nemployees ‘‘to self-organization’’; ‘‘to\nform, join, or assist labor organizations’’;\n‘‘to bargain collectively’’; and ‘‘to engage\nin other concerted activities’’; as well as\nthe right ‘‘to refrain from any or all such\nactivities.’’ Id. § 157. Section 8 defines\nand prohibits union and employer\n‘‘unfair labor practices’’ that infringe on\nemployees’ Section 7 rights, id. § 158,\nand Section 10 authorizes the Board to\nadjudicate unfair labor practice claims,\nid. § 160, subject to the NLRA’s\nprocedural six-month statute of\nlimitations, see Zipes v. Trans World\nAirlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 395 n.11\n(1982). Finally, Section 9 authorizes the\nBoard to conduct representation\nelections and issue certifications. 29\nU.S.C. 159.\nNotably, the NLRA does not give the\nBoard or its General Counsel roving\ninvestigatory powers. Although the\nBoard is specifically empowered to\n‘‘prevent’’ unfair labor practices, id.\n§ 160(a), ‘‘[t]he Board may not act until\nan unfair labor practice charge is filed\n* * * alleging a violation of the Act.’’\n2 The Developing Labor Law 2683 (John\nE. Higgins, Jr. ed., 5th ed. 2006). In\naddition, certification ‘‘procedures are\nset in motion with the filing of a\nrepresentation petition.’’ Id. at 2662. In\nboth instances, the initiating document\nis filed by a private party. Id. at 2683\n(citing 29 CFR 102.9); id. at 2662–63\n(citing 29 U.S.C. 159(c)(1)(A), (B), and\n(e)(1)).\nEnforcement of the NLRA and\neffectuation of Congress’s national labor\npolicy therefore depend on the\nexistence of outside actors who are not\nonly aware of their rights but also know\nwhere they may seek to vindicate them\nwithin appropriate timeframes. The\nDepartment of Labor made a similar\nfinding in an analogous rulemaking\nproceeding under the Fair Labor\nStandards Act: ‘‘effective enforcement of\nthe [FLSA] depends to a great extent\nupon knowledge on the part of covered\nemployees of the provisions of the act\nand the applicability of such provisions\nto them, and a greater degree of\ncompliance with the act has been\neffected in situations where employees\nare aware of their rights under the law.’’\n14 FR 7516, 7516 (Dec. 16, 1949). Given\nthe direct relationship between\nemployees’ timely awareness of their\nrights under the NLRA and the Board’s\nnecessary effect of burdening or obstructing\ncommerce,’’ id., depends on workers’ knowledge of\ntheir rights and the protections provided by the\nNLRB. The Board therefore rejects the argument of\nthe Manufacturer’s Association of South Central\nPennsylvania that both the notice-posting rule and\nthe Board’s general assertion of rulemaking\nauthority are inconsistent with Section 1.\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54011\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nability to protect and enforce those\nrights, this rule is ‘‘necessary’’ for\npurposes of Section 6.\nAside from the rule’s manifest\nnecessity, the notice posting\nrequirement fills a Chevron-type gap in\nthe NLRA’s statutory scheme. Thus, as\ndiscussed, the purpose of Section 1, as\nimplemented in Sections 7 and 8, is to\nencourage the free exercise and\nenforcement of the Act’s provisions, and\nfulfillment of that purpose depends on\nthe private initiative of employees and\nemployers to commence Board\nrepresentation proceedings pursuant to\nSection 9 and Board unfair labor\npractice proceedings pursuant to\nSection 10. The effective working of the\nNLRA’s administrative machinery\ntherefore presupposes that workers and\ntheir employers have knowledge of the\nrights afforded by the statute and the\nmeans for their timely enforcement. The\nstatute, however, has no provision with\nrespect to making that knowledge\navailable, a subject about which the\nstatute is completely silent.\nThis statutory gap has always been\npresent but was of less significance in\nearlier years when the density of union\norganization was greater, since, as is\nwidely recognized, unions have been a\ntraditional source of information about\nthe NLRA’s provisions. See Lechmere,\nInc. v. NLRB, 502 U.S. 527, 531–32\n(1992) (reaffirming that the Section 7\nrights of employees interested in union\norganization depend to some extent on\ntheir having access to unions); Harlan\nFuel Co., 8 N.L.R.B. 25, 32 (1938)\n(holding that the rights guaranteed to\nemployees by Section 7 include ‘‘full\nfreedom to receive aid, advice and\ninformation from others concerning\n[their self-organization] rights’’); cf.\nChamber of Commerce of the United\nStates v. Brown, 554 U.S. 60, 68 (2008)\n(observing that Section 7 ‘‘implies an\nunderlying right to receive\ninformation’’). Moreover, as rates of\nunionization have declined, employees\nare less likely to have experience with\ncollective bargaining or to be in contact\nwith other employees who have had\nsuch experience. The statutory gap is\nthus now important to the Board’s\nadministration of the NLRA and its role\nin enforcing employees’ rights.\nAs the Supreme Court has observed,\nThe responsibility to adapt the Act to\nchanging patterns of industrial life is\nentrusted to the Board. * * * It is the\nprovince of the Board, not the courts, to\ndetermine whether or not the ‘‘need’’ [for a\nBoard rule] exists in light of changing\nindustrial practices and the Board’s\ncumulative experience in dealing with labormanagement\nrelations. For the Board has the\n‘‘special function of applying the general\nprovisions of the Act to the complexities of\nindustrial life,’’ and its special competence in\nthis field is the justification for the deference\naccorded its determination.\nNLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S.\n251, 266 (1975) (citations omitted).\nConsistent with this understanding of\nthe Board’s role, the notice-posting\nregulations represent an attempt to\n‘‘adapt the Act’’ in light of recent\nrealities and ‘‘the Board’s cumulative\nexperience.’’ Id. The rule is wholly\nconsistent with the aims of the NLRA,\nand the ‘‘need’’ for it now is heightened\ngiven the ‘‘changing patterns of\nindustrial life.’’ Id.\nFor all these reasons, this rule is\nentitled to deference regardless of how\nit is characterized because it is\n‘‘reasonably related to the purposes of\nthe enabling legislation,’’ Thorpe, 393\nU.S. at 280–81, and constitutes a\n‘‘ ‘reasonable interpretation’ of the\nenacted text,’’ Mayo, 131 S. Ct. at 714\n(quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844).\nIn response to the NPRM, a number of\narguments have been made challenging\nthe Board’s statutory authority to\npromulgate the notice posting rule. As\nexplained below, the Board does not\nfind merit in any of these arguments.\n1. Limitations on the Board’s\nRulemaking Authority Implied by\nSections 9 and 10 of the Act\nOf the comments that address the\nBoard’s statutory authority to issue this\nrule, many express agreement with the\ndissenting views of Member Hayes that\nwere published in the NPRM. Member\nHayes criticized the basis for the rule\nand questioned the Board’s statutory\nauthority to promulgate and enforce it.\nSee 75 FR 80415. He specifically\nreferred to Section 10 as an obstacle to\nthe proposed rule, because it\n‘‘indicate[d] to [him] that the Board\nclearly lacks the authority to order\naffirmative notice-posting action in the\nabsence of an unfair labor practice\ncharge filed by an outside party.’’ Id.\nMany comments submitted in\nresponse to the NPRM, such as those of\nthe Texas Association for Home Care &\nHospice and those of the Independent\nBakers Association, interpret Section 10\nto prohibit the Board from ordering any\naffirmative act that does not address the\nconsequences of an unfair labor\npractice. Although this proposition may\nbe true when the Board acts through\nadjudication—the administrative\nfunction to which Section 10 directly\napplies—it does not perforce apply\nwhen the Board specifies affirmative\nrequirements via rulemaking under\nSection 6. See Clifton v. FEC, 114 F.3d\n1309, 1312 (1st Cir. 1997) (‘‘Agencies\nare often allowed through rulemaking to\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nregulate beyond the express substantive\ndirectives of the statute, so long as the\nstatute is not contradicted.’’) (citing\nMourning). If it did, then the Board’s\nlongstanding rule mandating that\nemployers post an election notice three\ndays before a representation election\nwould be subject to challenge on that\nground. See 29 CFR 103.20; see also\nPannier Corp., Graphics Div. v. NLRB,\n120 F.3d 603, 606–07 (6th Cir. 1997)\n(rejecting an as-applied challenge to\n§ 103.20). Furthermore, under American\nHospital Association, the Board’s\nexercise of its broad rulemaking\nauthority under Section 6 is presumed\nto be authorized unless elsewhere in the\nAct there is ‘‘language expressly\ndescribing an exception from that\nsection or at least referring specifically\nto the section.’’ 499 U.S. at 613. Section\n10 does not refer to the Board’s Section\n6 authority.\nSome comments, such as those of the\nCouncil on Labor Law Equality\n(COLLE), contend that the Board has no\nauthority whatsoever to administer the\nNLRA unless a representation petition\nor unfair labor practice charge has been\nfiled under Sections 9 or 10,\nrespectively. The Board declines to\nadopt such a narrow view of its own\nauthority. Certainly, the Board cannot\nissue certifications or unfair labor\npractice orders via rulemaking\nproceedings. But that is not what this\nrule does. As explained above, by\npromulgating the notice-posting rule,\nthe Board is taking a modest step that\nis ‘‘necessary to carry out the\nprovisions’’ of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 156,\nand that also fills a statutory gap left by\nCongress in the NLRA.\nMoreover, the argument advanced by\nCOLLE and others fails to appreciate\nthat the Board’s authority to administer\nthe Act is not strictly limited to those\nmeans specifically set forth in the\nNLRA. Rather, as the Supreme Court has\nrecognized, the NLRA impliedly\nauthorizes the Board to take appropriate\nmeasures ‘‘to prevent frustration of the\npurposes of the Act.’’ NLRB v. Nash-\nFinch Co., 404 U.S. 138, 142 (1971). By\nway of example, the Supreme Court\npointed out that its decisions had\nrecognized the Board’s implied\nauthority to petition for writs of\nprohibition against premature\ninvocation of the review jurisdiction of\nthe courts of appeals, see In re NLRB,\n304 U.S. 486, 496 (1938); to institute\ncontempt proceedings for violation of\nenforced Board orders, see\nAmalgamated Util. Workers v. Con.\nEdison Co., 309 U.S. 261 (1940); and to\nfile claims in bankruptcy for Boardawarded\nbackpay, see Nathanson v.\nNLRB, 344 U.S. 25 (1952). Relying on\n54012 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nthat precedent in Nash-Finch Co., the\nSupreme Court concluded that the\nBoard also had implied authority ‘‘to\nenjoin state action where [the Board’s]\nfederal power preempts the field.’’ 404\nU.S. at 144. Like these judicially\nrecognized powers, the notice-posting\nrequirement that is the subject of this\nrulemaking has not been specifically\nprovided for by Congress. But the cited\ncases demonstrate that Congress need\nnot expressly list a power for the Board\nto legitimately exercise it. Indeed, the\nnotice-posting requirement is not even\nan implied power of the Board in the\nsame sense as those previously\nmentioned. Rather, it is the product of\nthe Board’s exercise of express\nrulemaking authority and inherent gapfilling\nauthority, both of which have\nbeen delegated to the Board by\nCongress.\n2. The First Amendment and Section\n8(c) of the NLRA\nA handful of commenters argue that\nthe notice-posting requirement violates\nthe First Amendment to the\nConstitution, Section 8(c) of the NLRA,\nor both. For example, the Center on\nNational Labor Policy, Inc. maintains\nthat ‘‘compelling an employer to post its\nproperty with a Notice that asserts the\nstatutory ‘rights’ and employer\nobligations, runs counter to\nconstitutional views long protected by\nthe Supreme Court.’’ The Center also\nargues that the ‘‘proposed poster would\nimpede the employer’s statutory right to\nexpress itself on its own property.’’\nAlong these same lines, the National\nRight to Work Legal Defense\nFoundation, Inc. and others on whose\nbehalf it writes contend that ‘‘the\nBoard’s proposal for forced speech\nfavoring unionization directly conflicts\nwith the First Amendment and\nlongstanding federal labor policy under\nSection 8(c) that employers and unions\nshould be able to choose themselves\nwhat to say about unionization.’’ These\nconcerns were echoed by the National\nAssociation of Wholesaler-Distributors.\nIn addition, two attorneys affiliated with\nPilchak Cohen & Tice, P.C., which they\ndescribe as ‘‘a management-side labor\nand employment law firm,’’ argue that\nthe notice-posting requirement\n‘‘tramples upon employers’ Free Speech\nrights by regulating the content of\ninformation that employers are required\nto tell employees and by compelling\nthem to post the Notice containing prounion\nNLRA rights, when it is almost\nassuredly not the employers’ prerogative\nto do so.’’ The Independent Association\nof Bakers goes further and characterizes\nthe regulation as an unconstitutional\n‘‘gag order’’ that ‘‘prohibits the\nemployer from telling the truth about\nthe impact a union might pose to his\nbusiness.’’ The Board rejects these\narguments.\nAs an initial matter, requiring a notice\nof employee rights to be posted does not\nviolate the First Amendment, which\nprotects the freedom of speech. Indeed,\nthis rule does not involve employer\nspeech at all. The government, not the\nemployer, will produce and supply\nposters informing employees of their\nlegal rights. The government has sole\nresponsibility for the content of those\nposters, and the poster explicitly states\nthat it is an ‘‘official Government\nNotice’’; nothing in the poster is\nattributed to the employer. In fact, an\nemployer has no obligation beyond\nputting up this government poster.\nThese same considerations were present\nin Lake Butler Apparel Co. v. Secretary\nof Labor, 519 F.2d 84, 89 (5th Cir. 1975),\nwhere the Fifth Circuit rejected as\n‘‘nonsensical’’ an employer’s First\nAmendment challenge to the\nOccupational Safety and Health Act\nrequirement that it post an ‘‘information\nsign’’ similar to the one at issue here. As\nin Lake Butler, an employer subject to\nthe Board’s rule retains the right to\n‘‘differ with the wisdom of * * * this\nrequirement even to the point * * * of\nchallenging its validity. * * * But the\nFirst Amendment which gives him the\nfull right to contest validity to the bitter\nend cannot justify his refusal to post a\nnotice * * * thought to be essential.’’\nId.; see also Stockwell Mfg. Co. v. Usery,\n536 F.2d 1306, 1309–10 (10th Cir. 1976)\n(dicta) (rejecting a constitutional\nchallenge to a requirement that an\nemployer post a copy of an OSHA\ncitation).\nBut even if the Board’s notice-posting\nrequirement is construed to compel\nemployer speech, the Supreme Court\nhas recognized that governments have\n‘‘substantial leeway in determining\nappropriate information disclosure\nrequirements for business\ncorporations.’’ Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v.\nPub. Utils. Comm’n, 475 U.S. 1, 15 n.12\n(1985). This discretion is particularly\nwide when the government requires\ninformation disclosures relevant to the\nemployment relationship. Thus, as the\nD.C. Circuit has observed, ‘‘an\nemployer’s right to silence is sharply\nconstrained in the labor context, and\nleaves it subject to a variety of burdens\nto post notices of rights and risks.’’\nUAW-Labor Employment & Training\nCorp. v. Chao, 325 F.3d 360, 365 (D.C.\nCir. 2003) (UAW v. Chao) (citing Lake\nButler, 519 F.2d at 89). Accordingly, the\nBoard’s notice-posting requirement is\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nnot susceptible to a First Amendment\nchallenge. 44\nThe Board is equally satisfied that the\nrule does not violate NLRA Section 8(c),\n29 U.S.C. 158(c), which creates a safe\nharbor for noncoercive speech in the\nunfair labor practice area. Specifically,\nSection 8(c) shields from unfair labor\npractice liability ‘‘[t]he expressing of\nany views, argument or opinion,’’\nprovided that ‘‘such expression contains\nno threat of reprisal or force or promise\nof benefit.’’ Id. (emphasis added). A\ngovernment poster containing accurate,\nfactual information about employees’\nlegal rights ‘‘merely states what the law\nrequires.’’ Lake Butler, 519 F.2d at 89.\nFor that reason, ‘‘[t]he posting of the\nnotice does not by any stretch of the\nimagination reflect one way or the other\non the views of the employer.’’ Id. 45\n44 The decision of the intermediate state court in\nSmith v. Fair Employment & Housing Commission,\n30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 395 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994), rev’d on\nother grounds, 913 P.2d 909 (Cal. 1996), lends no\nsupport to arguments challenging these regulations\non First Amendment grounds. There, the California\nCourt of Appeal held that a landlord’s right to\nfreedom of speech was ‘‘implicate[d],’’ id. at 401–\n02, by a state fair housing agency’s remedial order\nrequiring her to sign, post, and distribute notices\n‘‘setting out the provisions of [the fair housing\nstatute], the outcome of th[e] case, and the\nstatement that [she] practices equal housing\nopportunity.’’ 913 P.2d at 914. The Smith case is\nnot persuasive here because the notice at issue in\nSmith would not merely have set forth the rights\nof prospective buyers or renters but also would\nhave contained a signed statement from the\nlandlord which would have given the false\nappearance that she agreed with the state’s fair\nhousing ‘‘concepts and rules,’’ despite her religious\nbeliefs to the contrary. 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 401. That\nfeature of the case has no parallel here. Here, by\ncontrast, employers are not required to sign the\ninformational notice, and as noted, nothing in the\nposter is attributed to them. The Board further notes\nthat the Smith decision is not authoritative because\nit was superseded by the California Supreme\nCourt’s grant of review in that case. See 913 P.2d\nat 916 n.*.\n45 The Employers Association of New Jersey is\ntherefore off the mark when it argues that the\nnotice-posting requirement is preempted under the\nprinciples of Lodge 76, International Ass’n of\nMachinists & Aerospace Workers v. Wisconsin\nEmployment Relations Commission, 427 U.S. 132\n(1976), as an attempt to regulate employer speech\n‘‘about unionization and collective bargaining.’’ As\nexplained above, the employer’s choice whether to\nexpress its own views, arguments, or opinions is\nwholly unaffected by a requirement to post a\ngovernment-provided notice summarizing what the\nlaw requires. Indeed, consistent with both\nMachinists and the policy of Section 8(c) ‘‘‘to\nencourage free debate on issues dividing labor and\nmanagement,’’’ Brown, 554 U.S. at 67 (quoting Linn\nv. United Plant Guard Workers, Local 114, 383 U.S.\n53, 62 (1966)), employers remain free under this\nrule—as they have in the past—to express\nnoncoercive views regarding the exercise of these\nrights as well as others. See, e.g., United Techs.\nCorp., 274 N.L.R.B. 609, 609, 618–20, 624–26\n(1985), enforced sub nom. NLRB v. Pratt & Whitney\nAir Craft Div.v., United Techs. Corp., 789 F.2d 121\n(2d Cir. 1986); Warrensburg Bd. & Paper Corp., 143\nN.L.R.B. 398, 398–99 (1963), enforced, 340 F.2d 920\n(2d Cir. 1965). For this reason, the Board finds it\nunnecessary to adopt the proposal made by the\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54013\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nBut even if the new rule is understood\nto compel employer speech, Section 8(c)\n‘‘‘merely implements the First\nAmendment.’’’ Brown, 554 U.S. at 67\n(quoting NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co.,\n395 U.S. 575, 617 (1969)). Thus, if a\nFirst Amendment challenge to the rule\nmust fail, so too must a challenge based\non Section 8(c). Such was the holding\nof the D.C. Circuit in UAW v. Chao.\nThere, the court was presented with a\npreemption argument, grounded in\nSection 8(c), challenging a Federal\nprocurement regulation that required\ncontractors to post a notice informing\ntheir employees of certain NLRA rights.\nThe D.C. Circuit interpreted Section 8(c)\nas coextensive with the scope of free\nspeech rights protected by the First\nAmendment and upheld the\nprocurement regulation in light of wellestablished\nfree speech jurisprudence in\nthe labor context. See 325 F.3d at 365.\n3. Lack of Contemporaneity With the\nEnactment of the NLRA\nSeveral comments attack the noticeposting\nregulation for its lack of\ncontemporaneity with the enactment of\nthe NLRA. For example, many\ncomments criticize the regulation by\nnoting that ‘‘this is a new rule\ninterpreted into the Act 75 years after its\npassage.’’ The Board rejects these\ncontentions for two reasons.\nFirst, the Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly ‘‘instructed that ‘neither\nantiquity nor contemporaneity with [a]\nstatute is a condition of [a regulation’s]\nvalidity.’’’ Mayo, 131 S. Ct. at 712\n(alterations in original) (quoting Smiley\nv. Citibank (S.D.), N.A., 517 U.S. 735,\n740 (1996)); see also Smiley, 517 U.S. at\n740 (deferring to a regulation ‘‘issued\nmore than 100 years after the\nenactment’’ of the statutory provision\nthat the regulation construed). Second,\nthe argument fails to consider that much\nhas changed since 1935, the year the\nNLRA was enacted. Unionization rates\nare one example. As pointed out in the\nNPRM and as confirmed by comments\nsubmitted by the Association of\nCorporate Counsel’s Employment and\nLabor Law Committee, unionization\nrates increased during the early years of\nthe Act, peaking at around 35 percent of\nthe workforce in the mid-1950s. But\nsince then, the share of the workforce\nrepresented by labor unions has\nPilchak attorneys to revise the rule to specify that\nemployers ‘‘may post a notice of equal dignity\nwhich advises employees of * * * additional rights\nand realities.’’ Alternatively, the Pilchak attorneys\npropose that the Board amend the rule to permit\nemployers to ‘‘alter the Poster and include\nadditional rights.’’ Adopting this suggestion would\ncompromise the integrity of the notice as a\ncommunication from the government. It, too, is\ntherefore rejected.\nplummeted to approximately 8 percent.\nAs a result, fewer employees today have\ndirect, everyday access to an important\nsource of information regarding NLRA\nrights and the Board’s ability to enforce\nthose rights.\nAs noted above, ‘‘[t]he responsibility\nto adapt the Act to changing patterns of\nindustrial life is entrusted to the Board.’’\nJ. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. at 266. It\nwould therefore be an abdication of that\nresponsibility for the Board to decline to\nadopt this rule simply because of its\nrecent vintage. Accordingly, the Board\nfinds such arguments unpersuasive.\n4. Comparison With Other Statutes That\nContain Notice-Posting Requirements\nMany comments note, as the Board\ndid in the NPRM, that several other\nlabor and employment statutes enacted\nby Congress contain express noticeposting\nprovisions. See 75 FR 80411\n(listing such statutes). Though a few\nsuch comments, such as those of the\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters,\napplaud the Board for ‘‘fill[ing] this\nglaring and indefensible gap,’’ the bulk\nof these comments instead argue that\nthe lack of a parallel statutory provision\nin the NLRA negates the existence of\nBoard authority to issue this rule.\nThe Board notes that inferences\ngleaned from side-by-side comparisons\nto other statutes have diminished force\nwhen an agency uses its gap-filling\nauthority under Chevron. There are\nmany possible reasons why Congress\ndid not include an express noticeposting\nprovision in the NLRA.\n‘‘Perhaps that body consciously desired\nthe [agency] to strike the balance at this\nlevel * * *; perhaps it simply did not\nconsider the question at this level; and\nperhaps Congress was unable to forge a\ncoalition on either side of the question\n* * *.’’ Chevron, 467 U.S. at 865. But,\n‘‘[f]or judicial purposes, it matters not\nwhich of these things occurred.’’ Id.\nIndeed, the central premise behind\nChevron and its progeny is that agencies\nshould be allowed reasonable latitude to\nfill gaps arising from congressional\nsilence or ambiguity. Accordingly, ‘‘the\ncontrast between Congress’s mandate in\none context with its silence in another\nsuggests not a prohibition but simply a\ndecision not to mandate any solution in\nthe second context, i.e., to leave the\nquestion to agency discretion.’’ Cheney\nR.R. Co. v. ICC, 902 F.2d 66, 69 (D.C.\nCir. 1990) (labeling the expressio unius\nest exclusio alterius canon ‘‘an\nespecially feeble helper’’ in Chevron\ncases).\nArguments contrasting the NLRA with\nother federal enactments that contain\nnotice-posting requirements might have\nsome persuasive force if there were\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nevidence that Congress had considered\nand rejected inserting such a\nrequirement into the Act. However,\nnothing in the legislative history of the\nAct so indicates. Indeed, there is not the\nslightest hint that the omission of a\nnotice-posting requirement was the\nproduct of legislative compromise and\ntherefore implies congressional rejection\nof the idea. Cf. Ind. Prot. & Advocacy\nServs. v. Ind. Family & Soc. Servs.\nAdmin., 603 F.3d 365, 384–85 (7th Cir.\n2010) (en banc) (Posner, J., concurring)\n(inferring a private right of action from\nstatutory silence in a case where such\nsilence was not the product of\n‘‘legislative compromise’’). For these\nreasons, the Board rejects the Motor and\nEquipment Manufacturers Association’s\nunsupported suggestion that there has\nbeen an affirmative ‘‘legislative\ndetermination not to include a posting\nrequirement by employers that have not\nviolated the Act.’’\nA number of comments point out that\nCongress included a general noticeposting\nprovision in the Railway Labor\nAct (RLA), which predates the NLRA.\nGiven the relative proximity of these\ntwo enactments, some comments regard\nthe absence of a notice-posting\nprovision in the NLRA as strong\nevidence that Congress did not intend\nfor there to be one. For reasons just\nexplained, the Board does not find a\nside-by-side comparison with the RLA\navailing. In addition, the Board notes\nthat although the NLRA and the RLA\nshare several common features, the\nNLRA was not perfectly modeled after\nthe RLA. See Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v.\nChi. River & Ind. R.R. Co., 353 U.S. 30,\n31 n.2 (1957) (‘‘The relationship of labor\nand management in the railroad\nindustry has developed on a pattern\ndifferent from other industries. The\nfundamental premises and principles of\nthe Railway Labor Act are not the same\nas those which form the basis of the\nNational Labor Relations Act * * *.’’).\nFinally, the Board notes that other\nfederal departments and agencies have\nnot understood Congress’s failure to\ninclude an express provision containing\na notice-posting requirement in a federal\nlabor or employment statute as a bar to\nsuch a regulatory requirement. Like the\nNLRA, the Fair Labor Standards Act\n(FLSA), which was passed in 1938, does\nnot contain a provision requiring\nemployers to post a notice of pertinent\nemployee rights. Yet the Department of\nLabor adopted a notice requirement now\ncodified at 29 CFR 516.4. Furthermore,\nthe Board is unaware of any challenge\nto the Labor Department’s authority to\npromulgate or enforce the FLSA notice\nrequirement, which has been in effect\nfor over 60 years. See 14 FR 7516 (Dec.\n54014 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\n16, 1949), promulgating 29 CFR 516.18,\nthe predecessor to 29 CFR 516.4.\n5. The Teamsters 357 Decision\nIn response to the NPRM, the U.S.\nChamber of Commerce submitted a\ncomment that questions ‘‘how the\nproposal can be said to be consistent\nwith’’ the Supreme Court’s decision in\nLocal 357, International Brotherhood of\nTeamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 (1961).\nSpecifically, the Chamber accuses the\nBoard of ignoring the Court’s\nadmonition in that case warning that\n‘‘[w]here * * * Congress has aimed its\nsanctions only at specific discriminatory\npractices, the Board cannot go farther\nand establish a broader, more pervasive\nregulatory scheme.’’ Id. at 675. The\nChamber reads this statement out of\ncontext.\nTo understand why the Board\ndisagrees with the Chamber’s view,\nfurther explanation of Teamsters 357 is\nnecessary. In that case, the Supreme\nCourt rejected the Board’s conclusion\nthat a union had committed an unfair\nlabor practice by operating an exclusive\nhiring hall pursuant to an agreement\nthat contained a nondiscrimination\nclause but not three additional clauses\nthat the Board had previously declared\nin its Mountain Pacific decision to be\nnecessary to prevent ‘‘ ‘unlawful\nencouragement of union membership.’ ’’\nId. at 671 (quoting Mountain Pacific\nChapter, 119 NLRB 883, 897 (1958)).\nThe Court first noted that Congress had\nexamined the operation of hiring halls\nand had decided not to ban them. Id. at\n673–74. Next, the Court observed that\nNLRA Section 8(a)(3) ‘‘ ‘does not outlaw\nall encouragement or discouragement of\nmembership in labor organizations; only\nsuch as is accomplished by\ndiscrimination is prohibited.’ ’’ Id. at\n674–75 (emphasis added) (quoting\nRadio Officers’ Union v. NLRB, 347 U.S.\n17, 42–43 (1954)). Since the hiring hall\nagreement at issue in Teamsters 357\n‘‘specifically provide[d] that there will\nbe no discrimination * * * because of\nthe presence or absence of union\nmembership,’’ the Court determined\nthat the Board was attempting to protect\nagainst nondiscriminatory\nencouragement of union membership.\nId. at 675. This was impermissible\nbecause ‘‘[w]here * * * Congress has\naimed its sanctions only at specific\ndiscriminatory practices, the Board\ncannot go farther and establish a\nbroader, more pervasive regulatory\nscheme.’’ Id. at 676.\nProperly understood, Teamsters 357\ndoes not preclude the Board from\nissuing the notice posting rule. The\nunion had not committed an unfair\nlabor practice in that case because its\nhiring hall agreement did not encourage\nor discourage union membership by\n‘‘discrimination.’’ See id. at 674–75. By\nfaulting the union for not including in\nits agreement clauses that the Board’s\nMountain Pacific rule had declared\nnecessary to prevent ‘‘ ‘unlawful\nencouragement of union membership,’ ’’\nid. at 671 (quoting Mountain Pacific\nChapter, 119 NLRB at 897), the Board\nhad attempted to regulate hiring halls in\na manner that was facially inconsistent\nwith the discrimination requirement\nembedded in NLRA Section 8(a)(3) and\n(b)(2). Accordingly, the Chamber makes\ntoo much of the Court’s statement\nprohibiting the Board from\n‘‘establish[ing] a broader, more\npervasive regulatory scheme’’ when\n‘‘specific discriminatory practices’’ have\nalready been outlawed. Id. at 676. By\nthat, the Court simply meant to remind\nthe Board that it may not\nadministratively amend Section 8(a)(3)\nand (b)(2) to prohibit nondiscriminatory\nactivity that might be viewed as\nundesirable because those statutory\nsections are clearly aimed only at\n‘‘specific discriminatory practices.’’\nId. 46\nThis rulemaking does not involve\nthose provisions of the NLRA that\nTeamsters 357 addressed. Accordingly,\nthe Board does not view that case as\ncontrolling the outcome of this\nproceeding.\n6. Miscellaneous Matters\nThe Center on National Labor Policy,\nInc., argues that the Board ‘‘must be\nmindful of the Supreme Court’s\nadmonition in Lechmere[, Inc.] v. NLRB,\n502 U.S. 527, 534 (1992), that an\nemployer possesses First Amendment\nrights to its property.’’ The Board\ndisagrees that the property rights\ndiscussed in Lechmere emanate from\nthe First Amendment, see Thunder\nBasin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200,\n217 n.21 (1994) (‘‘The right of\nemployers to exclude union organizers\nfrom their private property emanates\nfrom state common law * * *.’’), and to\nthe extent that the Center’s reference to\nthe First Amendment asserts a conflict\nbetween these regulations and\nemployers’ right to free speech, that\nargument is rejected for reasons\nexplained above. After quoting\nextensively from Lechmere, the Center\nnext contends that ‘‘if a union has no\naccess to company property to\ncommunicate with employees, neither\n46 To the extent that the Board espoused a\ncontrary view of Teamsters 357 in a prior\nrulemaking proceeding, that view is abandoned. See\nUnion Dues Regulation, 57 FR 43635, 43637–38\n(Sept. 22, 1992), withdrawn, 61 FR 11167 (Mar. 19,\n1996).\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 19:02 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\ndoes the Board without Section 10(c)\nauthority.’’ The Board rejects this\nargument because it fails to recognize\nthe important substantive difference\nbetween the conduct at issue in\nLechmere, which involved ‘‘ ‘trespassory\norganizational activity’ ’’ by\nnonemployees on the employer’s\ngrounds, id. at 535 (quoting Sears,\nRoebuck & Co. v. San Diego Dist.\nCouncil of Carpenters, 436 U.S. 180, 205\n(1978)), and the regulations here which\ninvolve nothing more than the\nemployer’s responsibility to post an\nofficial notice of legal rights.\nThe Portland Cement Association\n(PCA) comments that the Board’s failure\nto place the three law review articles\nthat the Board cited to the NPRM 47 in\nthe administrative docket is arbitrary\nand capricious. Although the Board\nprovided the legal citations for these\narticles, PCA believes that it should not\nhave to pay an electronic legal reporting\nservice to access the material. The Board\nhas placed these articles in the hard\ncopy docket, but has not uploaded these\narticles to the electronic docket at\nhttp://www.regulations.gov, because\nsuch an action could violate copyright\nlaws. 48\nFinally, one comment contends that\nrequiring employers to set aside wall\nspace for posting the notices violates the\nTakings Clause of the Fifth Amendment\nto the U.S. Constitution. The comment\ncites no authority for this proposition,\nwhich would seem to invalidate the\nnotice-posting requirements under all\nother Federal and state workplace\nstatutes. Accordingly, the Board rejects\nthis contention.\nIn conclusion, the Board believe that\nit has fully demonstrated that it\npossesses sufficient statutory authority\nto enact the final rule, and therefore that\nit is not ‘‘in excess of statutory\njurisdiction’’ or ‘‘short of statutory\nright’’ within the meaning of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, Section\n706(2)(C), 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(C).\nC. Factual Support for the Rule\nAs stated above, the Board found that\nthe notice posting rule is needed\nbecause it believes that many employees\nare unaware of their NLRA rights and\ntherefore cannot effectively exercise\nthose rights. The Board based this\nfinding on several factors: the\ncomparatively small percentage of\nprivate sector employees who are\nrepresented by unions and thus have\nready access to information about the\n47 See NPRM, 75 FR 80411 and fn. 3 above.\n48 The Board has also placed the other non-case\nmaterials cited to in this final rule into the hard\ncopy docket.\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54015\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nNLRA; the high percentage of\nimmigrants in the labor force, who are\nlikely to be unfamiliar with workplace\nrights in the United States; studies\nindicating that employees and high\nschool students about to enter the work\nforce are generally uninformed about\nlabor law; and the absence of a\nrequirement that, except in very limited\ncircumstances, employers or anyone\nelse inform employees about their\nNLRA rights. 75 FR 80411.\nA large number of comments contend\nthat the Board failed to demonstrate the\nnecessity of the notice posting rule.\nThey challenge each of the premises\n(except the last) underlying the Board’s\nbelief that employees are generally\nunaware of their NLRA rights.\nMany comments assert that, contrary\nto the Board’s belief, the right to join a\nunion is widely known and understood\nby employees. For example:\n—I believe the majority of employees know\nabout labor unions and how to form a\nunion, and this poster is unnecessary. 49\n—[I]t is hard to imagine that there are many\nin the US who do not know that they can\ntry to join a union.\n—The fact of the matter is that if a group of\nemployees are upset enough with their\ncurrent management that they feel they\nneed union representation, they already\nknow what they need to do as a recourse.\nAnd if they do not immediately know how\nto respond, there are plenty of resources for\nthem. 50\n—We, the employees, know the unions exist,\n* * * If the employees want to know about\nunions, they should research it themselves.\nIt is not as though the information is not\nreadily available.\nSome posit that comparatively few\nprivate sector employees are\nrepresented by unions not because\nemployees do not know that they can\njoin unions, but because they have\nconsciously rejected union\nrepresentation for any number of\nreasons (e.g., they do not believe that\nunions can help them; they do not want\nto pay union dues; they deem union\nrepresentation unnecessary in light of\nother workplace protection statutes). For\nexample:\n—Is it not just as probable that people clearly\nunderstand unions, and they have decided\nthey want no part of them?\n—Labor unions charge approximately 1.3%\nof pre-tax earnings for monthly dues. Many\nworkers, especially those who lost their\ngood paying jobs during this recession and\nhave found new jobs at $10.00-$11.00 per\nhour wages, need the dues money\nthemselves, in order to support their\nfamilies.\n49 Comment of the Employers Association.\n50 Comment of Malt-O-Meal Company (Malt-O-\nMeal).\n—Membership is down because so many of\nthe good things unions fought for a long\ntime ago have been legislated, at either the\nFederal or State level, and so the need for\nunions has declined. 51\n—[M]ost employees are very aware of their\nrights to unionize and many employees\nchoose not to do so because of the rights\nthey already have under our federal and\nstate laws.\n—In fact, one could say that the NLRA and\nother employment laws have succeeded to\nthe degree that unions are NOT necessary\nin today’s work environment. 52\nA few comments question the Board’s\nbelief that immigrant workers are\nunfamiliar with their workplace\nrights. 53 Several comments argue that\nthe NLRA has been in effect for nearly\n76 years, which is sufficient time for\nemployees to learn about its\nprovisions. 54\nA number of comments argue that the\nstudies cited in the NPRM are from the\nlate 1980s and early 1990s and are\ntherefore out of date 55 (and also, some\nsay, poorly supported). 56 Moreover,\nthose studies, whatever their value\nwhen published, predate the wide use\nof the internet. Now there are many\nonline sources of information\nconcerning unions and union\norganizing, including the Board’s own\nWeb site. According to these comments,\nit should not be necessary to require\nemployers to post notices of NLRA\nrights because employees who are\ninterested in learning about unions can\nquickly and easily find such\ninformation online. 57 One comment,\nlike some others, argues that ‘‘If it is so\nimportant that employees know their\nrights under the NLRB it should be the\ngovernment or union whose\nresponsibility it is to inform them.’’ 58\nTwo comments suggest that the Board\nconduct a mass media informational\ncampaign to that end, and one notes that\nthe Board has in fact recently increased\n51 Comment of Tecton Products.\n52 Comment of Printing and Imaging Association\nof MidAmerica (Printing and Imaging Ass’n).\n53 See, e.g., comment of the Printing and Imaging\nAss’n.\n54 See, e.g., comment of Coalition for a\nDemocratic Workplace.\n55 See, e.g., comments of Printing Industries of\nAmerica and the Portland Cement Association.\n56 See, e.g., comments of Cass County Electric\nCooperative and Pilchak Cohen & Tice, P.C.\n57 As one person states, ‘‘The internet has long\nago replaced lunch room bulletin board postings as\nthe means by which employees learn of and\nexercise their rights.’’\n58 Such comments appear to misunderstand that\nby this rule, the Board is indeed seeking to inform\nemployees of the provisions of the NLRA, using the\nmost accessible venues to reach them, their\nworkplaces.\nOther comments question why this rule does not\nmandate notice posting by governmental employers.\nThe NLRA does not cover such employers. See\nSection 2(2), 29 U.S.C. 152(2).\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nits public information efforts. 59 One\ncomment urges the Board to conduct a\nstudy to ascertain current employees’\nlevel of NLRA knowledge before\nimposing a notice posting requirement.\nIn contrast, as discussed in more\ndetail below, numerous comments from\nindividuals, union organizers, attorneys\nrepresenting unions, and worker\nassistance organizations agree with the\nBoard that most employees are\nunfamiliar with their NLRA rights.\nImmigrant rights organizations state that\nimmigrant workers largely do not know\nabout their rights.\nAfter careful consideration of the\ncomments on both sides of this issue,\nthe Board believes that many employees\nare unaware of their NLRA rights and\nthat a notice posting requirement is a\nreasonable means of promoting greater\nknowledge among employees. To the\nextent that employees’ general level of\nknowledge is uncertain, the Board\nbelieves that the potential benefit of a\nnotice posting requirement outweighs\nthe modest cost to employers. Certainly,\nthe Board has been presented with no\nevidence persuasively demonstrating\nthat knowledge of NLRA rights is\nwidespread among employees.\nThe comments asserting that the right\nto join a union is widely known cite\nlittle, if any, support for that assertion.\nBy contrast, many of the comments\ncontending that employees are\nunfamiliar with their NLRA rights base\ntheir statements on personal experience\nor on extensive experience representing\nor otherwise assisting employees. Many\nindividual workers, commenting on the\nrule, indicate their personal experiences\nwith the lack of NLRA knowledge and\nconcurrent strong support for the rule.\nFor example:\n—Even though most of my coworkers and\nsupervisors were highly intelligent people,\nit is my experience that most workers are\nalmost totally unaware of their rights under\nthe NLRA.\n—Knowing that there is a federal agency out\nthere that will protect the rights of working\npeople to organize is essential to the\nexercise of those rights.\n—I had no idea that I had the right to join\na union, and was often told by my\nemployer that I could not do so. * * * I\nthink employers should be required to post\nnotices so that all employees may make an\ninformed decision about their rights to join\na union. 60\n—Workers have rights and they have the\nright to know them. 61\n—[T]here is a lot of ignorance among young\nworkers and veteran workers alike with\nregard to knowledge of their right to\n59 Comment of Fisher & Phillips, LLP.\n60 Comment of Member, Local 150, Operating\nEngineers.\n61 Comment of Organizer, IBEW.\n54016 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\norganize. This is not a cure for employer\nintimidation, * * * but it is a step in the\nright direction.\n—As an employee at will, I was not aware\nof my rights to form a union or any rights\nthat I may have had under the NLRA. 62\n—I worked in the construction materials\ntesting industry for about eight years.\nDuring that time I had no idea I had the\nright to join a union. 63\n—As a working class citizen, I am well aware\nof just how rare it is for my fellow workers\nto know their rights. For that reason, this\nis a rule that is extremely overdue. * * *.\nA sampling of comments from labor\nattorneys, workers’ organizations, and\nlabor organizations is consistent with\nthese employees’ comments:\n—It is my experience that upwards of 95%\nof employees have no idea what their\nrights are with respect to labor unions. 64\n—In fact, I have had many employees over\nthe years tell me that their employers have\ntold them that they do not allow unions at\ntheir workplace. 65\n—Workers today do not know what their\nrights are under the NLRA. As a Union\norganizer with more than 20 years of\nexperience, without exception, every\nworker I encounter thinks that it is\nperfectly legal for their employer to fire\nthem simply for saying the word union, or\neven to speak with other employees at\nwork about general working conditions.\nThe protections afforded workers to engage\nin protected concerted activity around\nworkplace issues is unknown to the\nmajority of workers today. 66\n—It is the experience of [Service Employees\nInternational Union (SEIU) Local 615] that\nmany employees are woefully unaware of\ntheir rights under the NLRA and that that\nlack of knowledge makes employees\nvulnerable when they desire to address\ntheir wages and working conditions with\nthe employers. 67\n—I have participated in hundreds of\norganizing campaigns involving thousands\nof employees. In my experience, most\npeople had no idea what their rights were\nto organize or join unions. 68\nSome unions also assert that even\nunionized employees often do not have\na clear understanding of the NLRA. One\nunion staff representative writes that\n‘‘there seems to be a disconnect, most of\nour membership does not know a thing\nabout NLRA.’’ 69 Another union steward\ncomments similarly:\nI saw how union members were often\nunaware of their rights unless the union\n62 Comment of International Staff Representative,\nSteelworkers.\n63 Comment of Member, Local 150, Operating\nEngineers.\n64 Comment of Organizer, Local 150, Operating\nEngineers.\n65 Comment of Strokoff and Cowden.\n66 Comment of Organizer, Teamsters, Local 117.\n67 Comment of SEIU Local 615.\n68 Comment of Financial Secretary, Local 150,\nOperating Engineers.\n69 Comment of Staff Representative, Steelworkers.\nspecifically did outreach and member\neducation, or unless the employee ran into a\nproblem and came to a steward for\nassistance. * * *\nNotice to employees, however, could\nprovide a starting point for those employees\nto try to assert rights that they currently have\non paper but often do not have in practice.\nSeveral immigrant workers’\norganizations comment on the difficulty\nthat this population has in\nunderstanding their rights and accessing\nthe proper help when needed. 70 These\norganizations note that laws in the\nimmigrants’ home countries may be\nquite different from those of the United\nStates, and the high barrier that lack of\nfluency in English creates in making\nthese persons aware of their rights\nunder the NLRA. 71 These organizations\nalso contend that because guestworkers\nin particular can work only for the\nemployer that requested their visa, they\nare extremely vulnerable to labor\nviolations, and that these employers\nroutinely misrepresent the existence of\nNLRA rights. 72 The National Day\nLaborers Organizing Network claims\nthat ‘‘most workers are not aware of\ntheir right to organize.’’\nOne immigrant construction worker,\ncommenting favorably on the proposed\nrule, explains that she learned English\nafter coming to the United States from\nPoland: ‘‘While working as a testing\ntechnician, I had no idea I had the right\nto join a union.’’ She writes:\nI think a government written notice posted\nin the workplace would be a critical source\nof information for employees who want to\njoin a union. Especially in this industry\nwhere many people like myself are foreign\nborn, there is a language barrier that adds to\nthe difficulty in understanding our legal\nrights. I take government posted notices\nseriously and believe other people do as\nwell. 73\nSignificantly, the Board received\nnumerous comments opposing the rule\nprecisely because the commenters\nbelieve that the notice will increase the\nlevel of knowledge about the NLRA on\nthe part of employees. Specifically, they\npredict that the rule will lead to\nincreased unionization and create\nalleged adverse effects on employers\nand the economy generally. For\nexample, Baker and Daniels LLP\ncomments that as more employees\nbecome aware of their NLRA rights, they\nwill file more unfair labor practice\n70 See e.g., comments of National Immigration\nLaw Center and Latino Justice.\n71 See, e.g., comment of Friends of Farmworkers,\nInc.\n72 Comment of Alliance of Guestworkers for\nDignity.\n73 Comment of Instructor, Apprenticeship and\nSkill Improvement Program, Local 150, Operating\nEngineers.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\ncharges and elect unions to serve as\ntheir collective-bargaining\nrepresentatives. But fear that employees\nmay exercise their statutory rights is not\na valid reason for not informing them of\ntheir rights.\nMoreover, the NLRA protects the right\nto join a union and to refrain from doing\nso and the notice so states. In addition,\nthe NLRA confers and protects other\nrights besides the right to join or refrain\nfrom joining unions. Section 7 provides\nthat employees have the right ‘‘to engage\nin other concerted activities for the\npurpose of collective bargaining or other\nmutual aid or protection[.]’’ Such\nprotected concerted activities include\nconcertedly complaining or petitioning\nto management concerning their terms\nand conditions of employment; 74\nconcertedly petitioning government\nconcerning matters of mutual interest in\nthe workplace; 75 and concertedly\nrefusing to work under poor working\nconditions. 76 Few if any of the\ncomments contending that employees\nknow about their NLRA rights assert\nthat employees are aware of the right to\nengage in such protected concerted\nactivities in the nonunion setting. By\ncontrast, as shown above, many\ncomments favoring the rule report that\nnonunion employees are especially\nunlikely to be aware of their NLRA\nrights.\nAlthough some comments contend\nthat the articles cited by the Board in\nsupport of its belief that employees are\nlargely unaware of the NLRA rights are\nold and inadequately supported, 77 they\ncite no more recent or better supported\nstudies to the contrary. In addition, the\npercentage of the private sector\nworkforce represented by unions has\ndeclined from about 12 percent in 1989,\nabout the time the articles cited in the\nNPRM were published, to 8 percent\npresently; 78 thus, to the extent that lack\nof contact with unions contributed to\nlack of knowledge of NLRA rights 20\nyears ago, it probably is even more of a\nfactor today. 79\n74 North Carolina License Plate Agency #18, 346\nNLRB 293 (2006), enf’d. 243 F.

Accordingly, the Board does\nnot consider the number of times the\nBoard’s processes are invoked to be\npersuasive evidence that workers\ngenerally are aware of their NLRA\nrights.\nFinally, remarks in multiple opposing\ncomments strongly suggest that the\ncommenters themselves do not\nunderstand the basic provisions of the\nNLRA:\n—If my employees want to join a union they\nneed to look for a job in a union\ncompany. 82\n—[a]nytime one of our independent\ntradesmen would like to join the union\nthey are free to apply and be hired by a\nunion contractor.\n—If a person so desires to be employed by\na union company, they should take their\nass to a union company and apply for a\nunion job.\n—Belonging to a union is a privilege and a\npreference—not a right. 83\n—If they don’t like the way I treat them, then\ngo get another job.

This rule simply\naccepts those rates as given, and seeks to increase\nthe knowledge of NLRA provisions among those\nwithout readily available sources of reliable\ninformation on these provisions.\n80 See, e.g., comment of Desert Terrace Healthcare\nCenter.\n81 See Bureau of Labor Statistics, Economic News\nRelease, Table B–1, ‘‘Employees on nonfarm\npayrolls by industry sector and selected industry\ndetail,’’ May 3, 2011 (seasonally adjusted data for\nMarch 2011) http://data.bls.gov/timeseries\nLNS11300000?years_option=specific_years\n&include_graphs=true&to_year=2010\n&from_year=1948 (last visited June 6, 2011).\n82 Comment of P & L Fire Protection, Inc.\n83 Comment of OKC Tea Party.\n84 Comment of Montana Records Management,\nLLP.\n—We are not anti-union; but feel as\nAmericans, we must protect our right not\nto be signatory to a third party in our\nbusiness. 85\n—If one desires to be a part of a union, he\nor she is free to apply to those companies\nthat operate with that form of\nrelationship. 86\n—I also believe employees already have such\nnotice by understanding they retain the\nright to change employers whenever they\nso choose. 87\nThese comments reinforce the Board’s\nbelief that, in addition to informing\nemployees of their NLRA rights so that\nthey may better exercise those rights,\nposting the notice may have the\nbeneficial side effect of informing\nemployers concerning the NLRA’s\nrequirements. 88\nAs to the contention that information\nconcerning unions is widely available\non the internet, including on the Board’s\nWeb site, the Board responds that not all\nemployees have ready access to the\ninternet. Moreover, it is reasonable to\nassume that an employee who has no\nidea that he or she has a right to join a\nunion, attempt to organize his\nemployer’s workforce, or engage in\nother protected concerted activities,\nwould be less likely to seek such\ninformation than one who is aware of\nsuch rights and wants to learn more\nabout them. 89 The Board is pleased that\nit has received a large number of\ninquiries at its Web site seeking\ninformation concerning NLRA rights,\nbut it is under no illusion that that\ninformation will reach more than a\nsmall fraction of the workforce in the\nforeseeable future.\nSeveral comments assert that, in any\nevent, requiring the posting of notices\n85 Comment of Humphrey & Associates, Inc.\n86 Comment of Medina Excavating, Inc.\n87 Comment of Olsen Tool & Plastics, Co.\n88 And as one union official writes:\nHaving been active in labor relations for 30 years\nI can assure you that both employees and employers\nare confused about their respective rights under the\nNLRA. Even union officers often do not understand\ntheir rights. Members and non-members rarely\nunderstand their rights. Often labor management\ndisputes arise because one or both sides are misinformed\nabout their rights. Often the employer\ntakes an action it truly believes is within its rights\nwhen it is not.\nComment of Civil Service Employees Association.\n89 Thus, the many comments that assert that\nemployees can just use Internet search engines to\nfind out about unions (see, e.g., comments of\nWinseda Corp. Homestead Village, Inc.),\nmisapprehend the breadth of the rights of which the\nBoard seeks to apprise all employees. As stated\nabove, Section 7 is not merely about the right to join\nor refrain from joining a labor organization, but\nmore broadly protects the right of employees to\nengage in ‘‘concerted activities’’ for the purpose of\n‘‘mutual aid or protection.’’ It is this right that is\nthe most misunderstood and simply not subject to\nan easy Internet search by employees who may have\nno idea of what terms to use, or even that such a\nright might be protected at all.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nwill not be effective in informing\nemployees of their rights, because\nemployees will simply ignore the\nnotices, as the comments contend they\nignore other workplace postings.\n‘‘Posters are an ineffective means of\neducating workers and are rarely read\nby employees.’’ 90 Other comments\nargue that adding one more notice to the\nmany that are already mandated under\nother statutes will simply create more\n‘‘visual clutter’’ that contributes to\nemployees’ disinclination to pay\nattention to posted notices. As one\nemployer stated, ‘‘My bulletin boards\nare filled with required notifications\nthat nobody reads. In the past 15 years,\nnot one of our 200 employees has ever\nasked about any of these required\npostings. I have never seen anyone ever\nread one of them.’’ 91 Another wrote,\n‘‘Employers are already required to post\nso many notices that these notices have\nlost any semblance of effectiveness as a\ngovernmental communication channel.’’\nTo these comments, the Board\nresponds that the experiences of the\ncommenters is apparently not universal;\nother comments cited above contend\nthat employees are more knowledgeable\nabout their rights under statutes\nrequiring the posting of notices\nsummarizing those rights than about\ntheir NLRA rights. Moreover, not every\nemployee has to read workplace notices\nfor those notices to be effective. If only\none employee of a particular employer\nreads the Board’s notice and conveys\nwhat he or she has read to the other\nemployees, that may be enough to pique\ntheir interest in learning more about\ntheir NLRA rights. In addition, the\nBoard is mandating electronic notice to\nemployees on an internet or intranet\nsite, when the employer customarily\ncommunicates with its employees about\npersonnel rules or policies in that way,\nin order to reach those who read paper\nnotices and those who read electronic\npostings. As for the comment that\nargues that the Board can use public\nservice announcements or advertising to\nreach employees, the Board believes\nthat it makes much more sense to seek\nto reach directly the persons to whom\nthe Act applies, in the location where\nthey are most likely to hear about their\nother employment rights, the\nworkplace. 92\n90 Comment of Riverbend Community Mental\nHealth.\n91 Comment of Farmers Cooperative Compress.\n92 Printing Industries of America uses election\ndata to argue that the Labor Department’s notice\nposting rule for Federal contractors has not been\neffective because the rate of elections has not\nincreased.

One\nlabor attorney argues that the Board\nshould require annual trainings for\nsupervisors and captive audience\nmeetings where employees are read\ntheir rights by supervisors and Board\nagents and the employees would have to\nacknowledge receiving those notices. 93\nThe same comment suggests banning\ncaptive audience meetings by\nemployers. The comment concludes that\nthe NPRM ‘‘doesn’t go anywhere near\nfar enough. It is, however, an important\nand worthwhile advancement.’’ 94\nAnother comment also suggests that\nannual, mandatory training classes for\nemployees would be desirable. 95 The\nBoard believes that this Rule strikes the\nproper balance in communicating\nnecessary information about the NLRA\nto employees.\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the\nBoard is persuaded that many private\nsector employees are unaware of their\nNLRA rights. 96\nIII. Summary of Final Rule and\nDiscussion of Related Comments\nThe Board’s rule, which requires\nemployers subject to the NLRA to post\nnotices of employee rights under the\nNLRA, will be set forth in Chapter 1,\nPart 104 of Volume 29 of the Code of\nFederal Regulations (CFR). Subpart A of\nthe rule sets out definitions; prescribes\nthe size, form, and content of the\nemployee notice; and lists the categories\nof employers that are not covered by the\nrule. Subpart B sets out standards and\na few months, especially since the number of\ncontractors covered by the Labor Department’s rule\nis only a small fraction of the number of employers\nsubject to the NLRA. In any event, the Board does\nnot believe that that is the proper criterion by\nwhich to measure the rule’s effectiveness. The\npurpose of requiring the posting of such notices is\nto inform employees of their rights so that they may\nexercise them more effectively, not to obtain any\nparticular result such as the filing of more election\npetitions.\nThe same comment also cites a couple of\ntextbooks which it asserts are popularly used in\nhigh schools today to argue that labor history is\nbeing taught to today’s students. The Board is\nunable to assess the truth of that assertion, but\nregardless, it is unclear whether students\nnecessarily connect this history to their future\nrights as employees.\n93 Comment of Weinberg, Roger & Rosenfeld.\n94 Id.\n95 Comment of Staff Representative, Steelworkers.\n96 Accordingly, the Board finds it unnecessary to\nconduct a study to determine the extent of\nemployees’ knowledge of NLRA rights. The Board\nfurther observes that even if only 10 percent of\nworkers were unaware of those rights, that would\nstill mean that more than 10 million workers lacked\nknowledge of one of their most basic workplace\nrights. The Board believes that there is no question\nthat at least a similar percentage of employees are\nunaware of the rights explained in the notice. In the\nBoard’s view, that justifies issuing the rule.\nprocedures related to allegations of\nnoncompliance and enforcement of the\nrule. The discussion below is organized\nin the same manner and explains the\nBoard’s reasoning in adopting the\nstandards and procedures contained in\nthe regulatory text, including the\nBoard’s responses to the comments\nreceived.\nSubpart A—Definitions, Requirements\nfor Employee Notice, and Exceptions\nFrom Coverage Definitions\nA. The Definitions\nFor the most part, the definitions\nproposed in the rule are taken from\nthose appearing in Section 2 of the\nNLRA, 29 U.S.C. 152. No comments\nwere received concerning those\ndefinitions, and they are unchanged in\nthe final rule. A number of comments\nwere received concerning the definition\nof other terms appearing in the rule.\nThose comments are addressed below.\nB. Requirements for Employee Notice\n1. Content Requirements\nThe notice contains a summary of\nemployee rights established under the\nNLRA. As explained above, the Board\nbelieves that requiring notice of\nemployee rights is necessary to carry out\nthe provisions of the NLRA.\nAccordingly, § 104.202 of the proposed\nrule requires employers subject to the\nNLRA to post and maintain the notice\nin conspicuous places, including all\nplaces where notices to employees are\ncustomarily posted, and to take\nreasonable steps to ensure that the\nnotices are not altered, defaced, or\ncovered by any other material, or\notherwise rendered unreadable.\nAs stated in the NPRM, the Board\nconsidered the substantive content and\nlevel of detail the notice should contain\nregarding NLRA rights. In arriving at the\ncontent of the notice of employee rights,\nthe Board proposed to adopt the\nlanguage of the Department of Labor’s\nfinal rule requiring Federal contractors\nto post notices of employees’ NLRA\nrights. 29 CFR part 471. In the NPRM,\nthe Board explained that it tentatively\nagreed with the Department of Labor\nthat neither quoting the statement of\nemployee rights contained in Section 7\nof the NLRA nor briefly summarizing\nthose rights in the notice would be\nlikely to effectively inform employees of\ntheir rights. Rather, the language of the\nnotice should include a more detailed\ndescription of employee rights derived\nfrom Board and court decisions\nimplementing those rights. The Board\nalso stated that it saw merit in the\nDepartment of Labor’s judgment that\nincluding in the notice examples, again\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nderived from Board and court decisions,\nof conduct that violates the NLRA will\nassist employees in understanding their\nrights. 75 FR 80412.\nPrior to issuing the NPRM, the Board\ncarefully reviewed the content of the\nnotice required under the Department of\nLabor’s final rule, which was modified\nin response to comments from\nnumerous sources, and tentatively\nconcluded that that notice explains\nemployee rights accurately and\neffectively without going into excessive\nor confusing detail. The Board therefore\nfound it unnecessary, for purposes of\nthe proposed rulemaking, to modify the\nlanguage of the notice in the Department\nof Labor’s final rule. Moreover, the\nBoard reasoned that because the notice\nof employee rights would be the same\nunder the Board’s proposed rule as\nunder the Department of Labor’s rule,\nFederal contractors that have posted the\nDepartment of Labor’s required notice\nwould have complied with the Board’s\nrule and, so long as that notice is\nposted, would not have to post a second\nnotice. Id.\nThe proposed notice contained\nexamples of general circumstances that\nconstitute violations of employee rights\nunder the NLRA. Thus, the Board\nproposed a notice that provided\nemployees with more than a\nrudimentary overview of their rights\nunder the NLRA, in a user-friendly\nformat, while simultaneously not\noverwhelming employees with\ninformation that is unnecessary and\ndistracting in the limited format of a\nnotice. As explained below, the Board\nalso tentatively agreed with the\nDepartment of Labor that it is\nunnecessary for the notice to include\nspecifically the right of employees who\nare not union members and who are\ncovered by a contractual union-security\nclause to refuse to pay union dues and\nfees for any purpose other than\ncollective bargaining, contract\nadministration, or grievance adjustment.\nSee Communications Workers v. Beck,\n487 U.S. 735 (1988). Id. at 80412–80413.\nThe Board specifically invited\ncomment on the statement of employee\nrights proposed for inclusion in the\nrequired notice to employees. In\nparticular, the Board requested\ncomment on whether the notice\ncontains sufficient information of\nemployee rights under the NLRA;\nwhether it effectively conveys that\ninformation to employees; and whether\nit achieves the desired balance between\nproviding an overview of employee\nrights under the Act and limiting\nunnecessary and distracting\ninformation. Id. at 80413.\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54019\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nThe proposed Appendix to Subpart A\nincluded Board contact information and\nbasic enforcement procedures to enable\nemployees to learn more about their\nNLRA rights and how to enforce them.\nThus, the required notice confirmed that\nunlawful conduct will not be permitted,\nprovided information about the Board\nand about filing a charge with the\nBoard, and stated that the Board will\nprosecute violators of the NLRA. The\nnotice also indicated that there is a 6-\nmonth statute of limitations for filing\ncharges with the Board alleging\nviolations and provided Board contact\ninformation. The Board invited\nsuggested additions or deletions to these\nprovisions that would improve the\ncontent of the notice of employee rights.\nId.\nThe content of the proposed notice\nreceived more comments than any other\nsingle topic in the proposed rule. But of\nthe thousands of comments that address\nthe content of the notice, the majority\nare either very general, or identical or\nnearly identical form letters or\n‘‘postcard’’ comments sent in response\nto comment initiatives by various\ninterest groups, including those\nrepresenting employers, unions, and\nemployee rights organizations. Many\ncomments from both individuals and\norganizations offer general support for\nthe content of the proposed notice,\nstating that employee awareness of basic\nlegal rights will promote a fair and just\nworkplace, improve employee morale,\nand foster workforce stability, among\nother benefits. 97 More specifically, one\ncomment asserts that the proposed\nnotice ‘‘contains an accurate,\nunderstandable and balanced\npresentation of rights.’’ 98 The United\nTransportation Union contends that the\n‘‘notice presents an understandable,\nconcise and extremely informative\nrecitation of workers’ rights, without\ngetting bogged down in extraneous\nlanguage, incomprehensible legalese or\ninnumerable caveats and exceptions.’’\nOther comments were less supportive\nof the content of the proposed notice\nand the notice-posting requirement in\ngeneral. A significant number of\ncomments, including those from many\nindividuals, employers, and employer\nindustry and interest groups, argue that\nthe content of the notice is not balanced,\nand appears to promote unionization\ninstead of employee freedom of\nassociation. In particular, many\ncomments state that Section 7 of the\n97 See comments of the National Immigration Law\nCenter, Service Employees International Union, and\nWeinberg, Roger & Rosenfeld.\n98 Comment of David Fusco, a labor and\nemployment attorney.\nNLRA includes the right to refrain from\nunion activity, but claim that this right\nis given little attention in comparison to\nother rights in the proposed notice.\nSeveral comments also argue that the\nproposed notice excludes rights\nassociated with an anti-union position,\nincluding the right to seek\ndecertification of a bargaining\nrepresentative, the right to abstain from\nunion membership in ‘‘right-to-work’’\nstates, and rights associated with the\nSupreme Court’s decision in\nCommunications Workers v. Beck. 99\nComments also suggest that the notice\nshould include a warning to employees\nthat unionizing will result in a loss of\nthe right to negotiate directly with their\nemployer. 100 Many of these comments\nargue that a neutral government position\non unionization would be more\ninclusive of anti-union rights. 101\nA number of comments address the\nissue of complexity, and argue that the\nBoard’s attempt to summarize the law is\nflawed because the Board’s decisional\nlaw is too complex to condense into a\nsingle workplace notice. 102 Some of the\ncomments addressing this issue note\nthat NLRA law has been developed over\n75 years, and involves interpretations by\nboth the NLRB and the Federal courts,\nsometimes with conflicting results. The\nChamber of Commerce cites the\n‘‘NLRB’s Basic Guide to the National\nLabor Relations Act: General Principles\nof Law Under the Statute and\nProcedures of the National Labor\nRelations Board’’ (Basic Guide to the\nNLRA) (1997), available at http://\nwww.nlrb.gov/publications/brochures,\nto make their point about legal\ncomplexity. In the Foreword to the\nBasic Guide to the NLRA, the Board’s\nGeneral Counsel states that ‘‘[a]ny effort\nto state basic principles of law in a\nsimple way is a challenging and\nunenviable task. This is especially true\nabout labor law, a relatively complex\nfield of law.’’ The thrust of these\ncomments about legal complexity was\nthat the NLRA is complex, dynamic,\nand nuanced, and any attempt to\nsummarize it in a workplace notice will\nresult in an oversimplification of the\nlaw and lead to confusion,\nmisunderstanding, inconsistencies, and\nsome say, heightened labor-management\nantagonism. Moreover, some comments\nexpress concern that Board member\nturnover could result in changes to the\n99 See comments of Pilchak, Cohen & Tice,\nAmerican Trucking Association, and Electrical and\nMechanical Systems Inc.\n100 See, e.g. comment of the Heritage Foundation.\n101 See, e.g., comment of the National Right to\nWork Committee.\n102 See, e.g., comment of COLLE, Retail Industry\nLeaders Association.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nlaw, which may require frequent\nupdates to the notice. 103\nMany comments suggest that the\nrequired notice should include only the\nspecific rights contained in Section 7 of\nthe NLRA or, at most, the rights and\nobligations stated in employee\nadvisories on the NLRB’s Web site. The\ncomments favoring a more general\nnotice suggest that the detailed list of\nrights far exceeds the ‘‘short and plain’’\ndescription of rights that the Board has\nfound sufficient to ‘‘clearly and\neffectively inform employees of their\nrights under the Act’’ in unfair labor\npractice cases. 104 See Ishikawa Gasket\nAmerica, Inc., 337 NLRB 175 (2001),\nenfd. 354 F.3d 534 (6th Cir. 2004). A\ncomment from Fisher & Phillips LLP\nargues that, under the Board’s current\nremedial practices, only an employer\nthat egregiously violates the Act on\nnumerous occasions is required to post\nsuch an inclusive list of rights.\nFinally, a number of comments\nsuggest that the notice should include a\nlist of employer rights, namely the right\nto distribute anti-union literature and\nthe right to discuss the company’s\nposition regarding unions.\nIn addition to the general comments\nabout the proposed notice, many\ncomments offer suggestions for specific\nrevisions to individual provisions\nwithin the five sections of the proposed\nnotice: the introduction, the statement\nof affirmative rights, the examples of\nunlawful conduct, the collectivebargaining\nprovision, and the coverage\ninformation. The following discussion\npresents the comments related to\nindividual provisions of the notice,\nfollowed by the Board’s decisions\nregarding the content of the final notice\nmade in response to those comments.\na. Comments Regarding the Introduction\nThe introduction to the notice of\nrights in the proposed rule stated:\nThe National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)\nguarantees the right of employees to organize\nand bargain collectively with their\nemployers, and to engage in other protected\nconcerted activity. Employees covered by the\nNLRB are protected from certain types of\nemployer and union misconduct. This Notice\ngives you general information about your\nrights, and about the obligations of employers\nunder the NLRA. Contact the National Labor\nRelations Board (NLRB), the Federal agency\nthat investigates and resolves complaints\nunder the NLRA, using the contact\ninformation supplied below, if you have any\nquestions about specific rights that may\napply in your particular workplace.\n103 See comment of Capital Associated Industries,\nInc. and National Association of Manufacturers.\n104 See e.g. comments of COLLE and Coalition for\na Democratic Workplace.\n54020 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\n75 FR 80418–80419 (footnote omitted).\nThe Board received a few suggestions\nfor changes to the introduction of the\nnotice. The first comment suggests\nincluding language stating that\nemployees are required to contact their\n‘‘executive manager’’ or ‘‘administrative\nteam’’ before contacting the NLRB and\nsuggests that the NLRB refuse to process\nemployees’ complaints until the\nemployees first raise the issue with his\nor her ‘‘management team.’’ The second\ncomment, from COLLE, urges the Board\nto add language in the introduction\nalerting employees that they also have\nthe right to refrain from engaging in\nunion activity. The comment suggests\nthat by not including the right to refrain\nfrom union activity in the introduction,\nthe Board is showing a bias toward\nunion organizing. The comment argues\nthat a more neutral notice would\ninclude both the right to engage and not\nengage in union activity at the\nbeginning of the document, rather than\nwait to first mention the right to refrain\nin the affirmative rights section.\nThe Board does not agree with the\nproposal that employees be required to\ncontact management officials as a\nprerequisite to contacting the Board.\nSuch a procedural requirement is not\ncontemplated in the NLRA and could\ndiscourage employees from exercising\nor vindicating their rights.\nThe Board agrees, however, that the\nintroduction should include both the\nrights to engage in union and other\nconcerted activity and the right to\nrefrain from doing so. The Board\nbelieves that adding the right to refrain\nto the introduction will aid in the\nBoard’s approach to present a balanced\nand neutral statement of rights.\nAccordingly, the first sentence in the\nintroduction to the notice in the final\nrule will state:\nThe National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)\nguarantees the right of employees to organize\nand bargain collectively with their\nemployers, and to engage in other protected\nconcerted activity or to refrain from engaging\nin any of the above activity.\nb. Comments Regarding Affirmative\nStatement of Rights\nThe proposed notice contains the\nfollowing statement of affirmative\nrights: Under the NLRA, you have the\nright to:\nOrganize a union to negotiate with your\nemployer concerning your wages, hours, and\nother terms and conditions of employment.\nForm, join or assist a union.\nBargain collectively through\nrepresentatives of employees’ own choosing\nfor a contract with your employer setting\nyour wages, benefits, hours, and other\nworking conditions.\nDiscuss your terms and conditions of\nemployment or union organizing with your\nco-workers or a union.\nTake action with one or more co-workers\nto improve your working conditions by,\namong other means, raising work-related\ncomplaints directly with your employer or\nwith a government agency, and seeking help\nfrom a union.\nStrike and picket, depending on the\npurpose or means of the strike or the\npicketing.\nChoose not to do any of these activities,\nincluding joining or remaining a member of\na union.\n75 FR 80419.\nThe majority of comments addressing\nthe affirmative rights section were\ngeneral and did not specifically address\nthe language of the individual\nprovisions. Generally, labor\norganizations and employee advocate\ngroups favor the Board’s language. A\ncomment from the United Food and\nCommercial Workers International\nUnion asserts that the approach\n‘‘achieves an appropriate balance\nbetween providing sufficiently clear\ninformation about employee’s basic\nstatutory rights and limiting\nunnecessary and confusing information\nabout peripheral rights.’’ On the other\nhand, comments from employer groups\ndo not favor the Board’s language. More\nspecifically, employer groups argue that\nthe notice is biased toward union\norganizing. Generally, the comments\nargue that the right to refrain from\nengaging in union activity should have\na more prominent place on the notice,\nrather than being the last of the rights\nlisted on the poster. Many of these\ncomments contend that the notice\nshould include the right not to engage\nin specific union-related activities.\nOther comments about the notice’s\nstatement of affirmative rights are\ndirected at individual provisions of the\nnotice. A discussion of those comments\nis set out in more detail below.\ni. The Right To Organize and the Right\nTo Form, Join and Assist a Union\nA few comments generally state that\nthe notice should include the\nconsequences of exercising the right to\norganize, join or form a union. 105 For\nexample, several comments argue that\nemployees should be informed that if\nthey join a union they give up the right\nto deal directly with their employers.\nAnother comment argues that\nemployees should be informed of the\ncost of organizing a union, including the\ncost of dues and the potential for the\ncompany to shut down because of\nincreased labor costs associated with a\nunionized workforce. Other comments\n105 See, e.g., comment of Pilchak Cohen & Tice.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nsuggest including language informing\nemployees that they can be fired for not\npaying their union dues.\nThe Board rejects those suggestions.\nThe notice is intended to inform\nemployees of the rights that they have\nunder the NLRA and does not include\nthe benefits or consequences of\nexercising any of the enumerated rights.\nAdding the consequences of one right\nwould require revising the entire notice\nto include potential consequences—\nboth positive and negative—of all the\nprotected rights. For example, the notice\nwould need to include the\nconsequences of refraining from joining\na union, such as not being permitted to\nvote on contract ratifications or attend\nunion membership meetings. The\nnecessary additions to the notice would\ncreate a notice that is not a concise list\nof rights, but more likely a pamphletsized\nlist of rights and explanations. In\naddition, the consequences of\nunionization are unique to each\nunionized workplace, so it would be\nimpossible to include a list of general\nconsequences that could apply\nuniformly to all unionized workplaces.\nIf employees have questions about the\nimplications of any of their rights, they\ncan contact an NLRB regional office.\nAssisted Living Federation of America\n(ALFA) suggests that the affirmative\nrights section should be revised to\nreflect the anti-union position. For\nexample, rather than the current\nprovision that states that employees\nhave a right to ‘‘[o]rganize a union to\nnegotiate with your employer\nconcerning your wages, hours, and other\nterms and conditions of employment,’’\nthe comment suggests the following\nprovision: ‘‘you have the right to\norganize with other employees in\nopposition to a particular union or\nunions.’’ And ‘‘you have the right to:\nrefuse to form, join, or assist a union,\nincluding the right to refuse to sign a\nunion card, attend a union meeting or\nsupply a union with information\nconcerning you, your co-worker or your\njob,’’ rather than ‘‘[you have the right to]\n[f]orm, join or assist a union.’’ The\nBoard disagrees. The Board’s proposed\nnotice language reflects the language of\nthe NLRA itself, which specifically\ngrants affirmative rights, including\nnearly all of those listed in the notice.\nAlso, the notice, like the NLRA, states\nthat employees have the right to refrain\nfrom engaging in all of the listed\nactivities. The Board therefore sees no\nneed to recast the notice to further\nemphasize the right to oppose unions.\nii. The Right To Bargain Collectively\nTwo comments suggest that the\ncollective-bargaining provision is\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54021\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nmisleading and vague. The first\ncomment, from COLLE, argues that the\nprovision is misleading because it fails\nto acknowledge that an employer does\nnot have an obligation under the NLRA\nto consent to the establishment of a\ncollective-bargaining agreement, but\ninstead only has the statutory duty to\n‘‘meet at reasonable times and confer in\ngood faith with respect to wages, hours,\nand other terms and conditions of\nemployment.’’ 29 U.S.C. 158(d). The\ncomment also argues that the failure to\nreach an agreement is not per se\nunlawful, and the finding of an unfair\nlabor practice depends on whether the\nparties engaged in good-faith bargaining.\nThis comment suggests that the notice\nshould instead note that the NLRA\nrequires parties to bargain in good faith\nbut does not compel agreement or the\nmaking of concessions, and that, in\nsome instances, a bargaining impasse\nwill result, permitting the parties to\nexercise their economic weapons, such\nas strikes or lockouts. The second\ncomment, made generally by more than\na few organizations and individuals,\nsuggests that the notice add a statement\nindicating that employers and unions\nhave an obligation to bargain in good\nfaith.\nThe Board finds it unnecessary to add\nthe suggested amplifications. For one\nthing, the notice does state that\nemployers and unions have a duty to\nbargain in good faith, ‘‘in a genuine\neffort to reach a written, binding\nagreement setting your terms and\nconditions of employment.’’ In the\nBoard’s view, the statement that the\nparties must make a ‘‘genuine effort’’ to\nreach agreement necessarily implies that\nthey are not, in the end, required to\nreach one. The Board deems the notice\nlanguage to be adequate on this point.\nFinally, for the reasons already\ndiscussed, the Board rejects the\ncontention that the notice should\ndiscuss the implications or\nconsequences of unsuccessful\nbargaining.\niii. The Right To Discuss With Co-\nWorkers or Union\nA comment from the National\nImmigration Law Center suggests that\nthe use of the phrase ‘‘terms and\nconditions of employment’’ is unclear\nespecially to employees who are\nunaware of their rights under the NLRA.\nThe comment recommends that, in\norder to clarify, the Board add the\nphrase ‘‘including wages and benefits.’’\nThe suggested language would read,\n‘‘you have the right to: discuss your\nterms and conditions of employment,\nincluding wages and benefits, or union\norganizing with your co-workers or a\nunion.’’\nThe Board agrees that adding the\nsuggested language would clarify the\nprovision. The list of affirmative rights\nuses the terms ‘‘wages, hours, and other\nterms and conditions of employment’’ to\ndescribe what unions may negotiate.\nThe notice then uses the terms ‘‘wages,\nbenefits, hours, and other working\nconditions’’ to describe the right to\nbargain collectively for a contract. Those\nstatements make it clear that ‘‘terms and\nconditions of employment’’ includes\nwages and benefits. But then\nimmediately following those two\nstatements, the notice states that\nemployees may discuss ‘‘terms and\nconditions of employment,’’ but does\nnot include any clarifying language. In\norder, to create a more uniform notice\nand clarify the extent to which\nemployees may discuss their terms and\nconditions of employment the final\nnotice will read, ‘‘Under the NLRA, you\nhave a right to: Discuss your wages and\nbenefits and other terms and conditions\nof employment or union organizing with\nyour co-workers or a union.’’\niv. The Right To Strike and Picket\nThe notice’s reference to the right to\nstrike and picket received a few\ncomments from law firms and other\norganizations representing employers’\ninterests. The comments suggest that the\nprovision is flawed because of the\nabsence of further limitations,\nexceptions, and distinctions. 106\nGenerally, the comments argue that not\nall strikes and pickets are protected.\nCOLLE argues that the notice should\ninform employees of the limitations of\nstrikes encompassed by ‘‘depending on\nthe purpose or means of the strike or\npickets’’—for example, whether the\nstrike is for recognition or bargaining,\nwhether the strike has a secondary\npurpose, whether picketing involves a\nreserved gate, whether the strike is a sitdown\nor minority strike, whether the\nconduct is a slowdown and not a full\nwithholding of work, whether the strike\nis partial or intermittent, whether the\nstrike involves violence, and whether\nthe strike is an unfair labor practice\nstrike or an economic strike. ALFA\nargues that employees should be\ninformed that if the employer is a\nhealthcare institution, ‘‘employees do\nnot have the right to participate in a\nunion-initiated strike or picket unless\nthe union has provided the employer\nand federal and state mediation agencies\nwith the required 10 days notice.’’\n106 See comments of ALFA, Carrollton Health and\nRehabilitation Center, and COLLE.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nThe Board disagrees. By necessity, an\n11x17-inch notice cannot contain an\nexhaustive list of limitations on and\nexceptions to the rights to strike and\npicket, as suggested by employers.\nHowever, because exercising the right to\nstrike can significantly affect the\nlivelihood of employees, the Board\nconsiders it important to alert\nemployees that there are some\nlimitations to exercising this right. The\nBoard is satisfied that the general\ncaveat, ‘‘depending on the purpose or\nmeans of the strike or the picketing,’’\ntogether with the instruction to contact\nthe NLRB with specific questions about\nthe application of rights in certain\nsituations, provides sufficient guidance\nto employees about the exercise of their\nrights while still staying within the\nconstraints set by a necessarily brief\nemployee notice.\nv. The Right To Refrain From Union or\nOther Protected Concerted Activity\nAll the comments that discuss the\nright to refrain from engaging in union\nactivity criticize what they contend to\nbe its lack of prominence. ALFA accuses\nthe Board of ‘‘burying’’ the provision by\nplacing it last, below the other rights to\nengage in union and other concerted\nactivity. The U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce suggests that the notice\ninclude ‘‘or not’’ after each of the\nenumerated rights. For example, ‘‘you\nhave the right to: form join or assist a\nunion, or not.’’ (Emphasis added.) Other\nsuggested revisions to amplify the\nprominence of the provision include\nstating that employees have the right to\nrefrain from protected, concerted\nactivities and/or union activities; stating\nthat employees’ right to refrain includes\nthe right to actively oppose\nunionization, to not sign union\nauthorization cards, to request a secret\nballot election, to not be a member of a\nunion or pay dues or fees (addressed\nfurther below), or to decertify a union\n(also addressed below); and stating that\nemployees have the right to be fairly\nrepresented even if not a member of the\nunion. One employer suggests that if the\nnotice retains its current emphasis\nfavoring union activity and disfavoring\nthe freedom to refrain from such\nactivity, employers will need to post\ntheir own notices that emphasize and\nelaborate on the right to refrain.\nThe Board received at least four\ncomments that argue that the notice, as\nwritten, may make employees believe\nthat the employer is encouraging\nunionization. Two of those comments\nsuggest that an employer is protected\nfrom compelled speech by Section 8(c)\nof the NLRA. (The Board has already\nrejected the latter argument; see section\n54022 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nII, subsection B, ‘‘Statutory Authority,’’\nabove.)\nThe contention that the right to\nrefrain from engaging in union activity\nis ‘‘buried’’ in the list of other\naffirmative rights or that the Board is\nbiased in favor of unionization because\nof the choice of placement is without\nmerit. The list of rights in the proposed\nnotice is patterned after the list of rights\nin Section 7 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 157.\nSection 7 lists the right to refrain last,\nafter stating several other affirmative\nrights before it. In addition, the Board’s\nremedial notices list the right to refrain\nlast. See Ishikawa Gasket America, Inc.,\nabove. So does the Board’s Notice of\nElection. In addition, the notice\nrequired by this rule states that it is\nillegal for an employer to take adverse\naction against an employee ‘‘because\n[the employee] choose[s] not to engage\nin any such [union-related] activity.’’\nThe Board has revised the introduction\nof the notice to include the right to\nrefrain—this addition further highlights\nan employee’s right to refrain from\nunion activity. Finally, the Board\nbelieves that people understand a right\nas different from an obligation and thus\nwill, for example, understand that the\nright to organize a union includes the\nright not to do so. Accordingly, the\nBoard concludes that the notice\nsufficiently addresses the right to refrain\namong the list of statutory rights. In\naddressing the numerous comments\nquestioning the Board’s neutrality, the\nBoard points out that in Section 1 of the\nNLRA, Congress declared that it is the\npolicy of the United States to mitigate\nor eliminate obstructions to the free\nflow of commerce ‘‘by encouraging the\npractice and procedure of collective\nbargaining and by protecting the\nexercise by workers of full freedom of\nassociation, self-organization, and\ndesignation of representatives of their\nown choosing, for the purpose of\nnegotiating the terms and conditions of\ntheir employment or other mutual aid or\nprotection.’’ 29 U.S.C. 151. Thus, by its\nown terms, the NLRA encourages\ncollective bargaining and the exercise of\nthe other affirmative rights guaranteed\nby the statute. In doing so, however, the\nNLRA seeks to ensure employee choice\nboth to participate in union or other\nprotected concerted activity and to\nrefrain from doing so.\nTurning to the issues of whether the\nnotice creates the impression that the\nemployer is encouraging unionization\nand whether an employer can be\ncompelled to post the notice which\ncontains information the employer\nwould otherwise not share with\nemployees, the Board disagrees with\nboth arguments. First, the notice clearly\nstates that it is from the government.\nSecond, in light of the other workplace\nnotice employees are accustomed to\nseeing, employees will understand that\nthe notice is a communication to\nworkers from the government, not from\nthe employer. Finally, as discussed\nabove, NLRA Section 8(c) protects\nemployers’ right to express any ‘‘views,\nargument, or opinion’’ ‘‘if such\nexpression contains no threat of reprisal\nor force or promise of benefit.’’ The rule\ndoes not affect this right. Therefore, if\nan employer is concerned that\nemployees will get the wrong\nimpression, it may legally express its\nopinion regarding unionization as long\nas it does so in a noncoercive manner.\nCritics of the notice contend that the\nnotice should contain a number of\nadditional rights and also explanations\nof when and how an employee may opt\nout of paying union dues. Thus, most\nemployer groups argue that the notice\nshould contain a statement regarding\nthe right to decertify a union. A number\nof those comments state that the notice\nshould provide detailed guidance on the\nprocess for decertifying a union. Others\nsuggest that the notice should contain\ninstructions for deauthorizing a union\nsecurity clause. A majority of employers\nand individuals who filed comments on\nthe content of the notice urge the Board\nto include a notice of employee rights\nunder Communications Workers v.\nBeck. Baker & McKenzie suggests\nadding a provision informing employees\nthat for religious purposes an employee\nmay opt out of paying dues to a\nunion. 107 A few comments also suggest\nthat the notice add any rights that\nemployees may have in ‘‘right-to-work’’\nstates. As indicated previously,\nnumerous comments suggest the\ninclusion of other rights of employees\nwho do not desire union representation.\nBaker & McKenzie suggests a list of 26\nadditional affirmative rights, most of\nwhich only affect employees in a\nunionized setting and are derived from\nthe Labor-Management Reporting and\nDisclosure Act, the Labor-Management\nRelations Act, or other Federal labor\nstatutes enforced by the Department of\nLabor. The proposed list also includes\n107 NLRA Section 19 provides that ‘‘Any\nemployee who is a member of and adheres to\nestablished and traditional tenets or teachings of a\nbona fide religion, body, or sect which has\nhistorically held conscientious objections to joining\nor financially supporting labor organizations shall\nnot be required to join or financially support any\nlabor organization as a condition of employment;\nexcept that such employee may be required in a\ncontract between such employee’s employer and a\nlabor organization in lieu of periodic dues and\ninitiation fees, to pay sums equal to such dues and\ninitiation fees to a nonreligious, nonlabor\norganization charitable fund exempt from\ntaxation[.]’’ 29 U.S.C. 169.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nsome rights covered by the NLRA such\nas ‘‘the right to sign or refuse to sign an\nauthorization card,’’ ‘‘the right to\ndiscuss the advantages and\ndisadvantages of union representation\nor membership with the employer,’’ and\n‘‘the right to receive information from\nthe employer regarding the advantages\nand disadvantages of union\nrepresentation.’’\nThe Board has determined that the\ninclusion of these additional items is\nunnecessary. As discussed above, the\nNLRA itself contains only a general\nstatement that employees have the right\nnot to participate in union and/or other\nprotected concerted activities. Section\n19 does specifically set forth the right of\ncertain religious objectors to pay the\nequivalent of union dues to a taxexempt\ncharity; however, this right is\nimplicated only when an employer and\nunion have entered into a unionsecurity\narrangement. Because the\nnotice does not mention or explain such\narrangements, the Board finds no reason\nto list this narrow exception to unionsecurity\nrequirements. In sum, the\nBoard is not persuaded that the notice\nneeds to expand further on the right to\nrefrain by including a list of specific\nways in which employees can elect not\nto participate or opt out of paying union\ndues. Employees who desire more\ninformation regarding the right not to\nparticipate can contact the Board.\nThe Board does not believe that\nfurther explication of this point is\nnecessary. However, because so many\ncomments argue that the notice should\ninclude the right to decertify a union\nand rights under Communication\nWorkers v. Beck, the Board has decided\nto explain specifically why it disagrees\nwith each contention.\nConcerning the right to decertify, the\nnotice states that employees have the\nright not to engage in union activity,\n‘‘including joining or remaining a\nmember of a union.’’ Moreover, the\nnotice does not mention the right to\nseek Board certification of a union.\nIndeed, contrary to the numerous\ncomments suggesting that the proposed\nnotice is a ‘‘roadmap’’ for union\norganizing, the notice does not even\nmention the right to petition for a union\nrepresentation election, possibly leading\nto union certification; rather, it merely\nstates that employees have the right to\n‘‘organize a union’’ and ‘‘form, join or\nassist a union.’’ The notice does not give\nany further instructions on how an\nemployee can exercise those rights.\nSimilarly, the notice states that\nemployees may choose not to remain a\nmember of a union without further\ninstructions on how to exercise that\nright. To include instructions for\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54023\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nexercising one right and not the other\nwould upset the balanced recitation of\nrights. If employees have questions\nconcerning how they can exercise their\nrights, the notice encourages them to\ncontact the Board.\nThe Board has also determined that\nthe addition of Beck rights in the final\nnotice is unnecessary. Those rights\napply only to employees who are\nrepresented by unions under collectivebargaining\nagreements containing\nunion-security provisions. As stated in\nthe NPRM, unions that seek to obligate\nemployees to pay dues and fees under\nthose provisions are required to inform\nthose employees of their Beck rights.\nSee California Saw & Knife Works,\nabove, 320 NLRB at 233. See 75 FR at\n80412–80413. The Board was presented\nwith no evidence during this\nrulemaking that suggests that unions are\nnot generally complying with their\nnotice obligations. In addition, the\nNotice of Election, which is posted days\nbefore employees vote on whether to be\nrepresented by a union, contains an\nexplanation of Beck rights. Moreover, as\nthe Board stated in the NPRM, only\nabout 8 percent of all private sector\nemployees are represented by unions,\nand by no means are all of them subject\nto union-security clauses. Accordingly,\nthe number of employees to whom Beck\napplies is significantly smaller than the\nnumber of employees in the private\nsector covered by the NLRA. Id. at\n80413. Indeed, in the ‘‘right-to-work’’\nstates, where union-security clauses are\nprohibited, no employees are covered by\nunion security clauses, with the\npossible exception of employees who\nwork in a Federal enclave where state\nlaws do not apply. Accordingly, because\nBeck does not apply to the\noverwhelming majority of employees in\ntoday’s private sector workplace, and\nbecause unions already are obliged to\ninform the employees to whom it does\napply of their Beck rights, the Board is\nnot including Beck notification in the\nfinal notice.\nThe Board also disagrees with the\ncomment from Baker & McKenzie\ncontending that an exhaustive list of\nadditional rights should be included in\nthe notice. In addition to the reasons\ndiscussed above, the Board finds that it\nwould not be appropriate to include\nthose rights, most of which are rights of\nunion members vis-à-vis their unions.\nFor example, the comment suggests\nincluding the ‘‘right for each union\nmember to insist that his/her dues and\ninitiation fees not be increased * * *\nexcept by a majority vote by secret\nballot * * *,’’ the ‘‘right of each\nemployee in a bargaining unit to receive\na copy of the collective bargaining\nagreement,’’ and the ‘‘right to nominate\ncandidates, to vote in elections of the\nlabor organization, to attend\nmembership meetings, and to\nparticipate in the deliberations and\nvoting upon business properly before\nthe meeting.’’ Those rights are not found\nin the NLRA, but instead arise from\nother Federal labor laws not\nadministered by the NLRB. See Labor-\nManagement Reporting and Disclosure\nAct of 1959, 29 U.S.C. 401 et seq\n(LMRDA). The Board finds that it would\nbe inappropriate to include those\nadditional rights in a notice informing\nemployees of their rights under the\nNLRA.\nvi. Other Comments\nThe Board has also considered, but\nrejected, the contention that the notice\ncontain simply a ‘‘short and plain’’\ndescription of rights such as that used\nin remedial notices. See Ishikawa\nGasket America, Inc., above. The two\nnotices have different purposes: one\nlooks back; the other, forward. As\nexplained in the NPRM, the principal\npurpose of a remedial notice is to\ninform employees of unlawful conduct\nthat has taken place and what is being\ndone to remedy that conduct.\nAccordingly, although a remedial notice\ncontains only a brief summary of NLRA\nrights, it also contains examples of\nunlawful actions that have been\ncommitted. To the extent that such a\nnotice generally increases employees’\nawareness of their rights, the unlawful\nconduct detailed adds to that awareness.\nThe proposed notice, by contrast, is a\nnotice intended to make employees\naware of their NLRA rights generally. It\nnormally will not be posted against a\nbackground of already-committed unfair\nlabor practices; it therefore needs to\ncontain a summary both of NLRA rights\nand examples of unlawful conduct in\norder to inform employees effectively of\nthe extent of their NLRA rights and of\nthe availability of remedies for\nviolations of those rights. Moreover, as\nthe Board explained in the NPRM, the\ngeneral notice of rights posted in the\npre-election notice is sufficient because\nat least one union along with the\nemployer is on the scene to enlighten\nemployees of their rights under the\nNLRA. 75 FR 80412 fn.19.\nThe fundamental rights described in\nthe notice are well established and have\nbeen unchanged for much of the Board’s\nhistory. Accordingly, the Board does not\nshare the concern expressed in some\ncomments that a new notice will have\nto be posted each time the composition\nof the Board changes.\nFinally, the Board rejects the\ncontention that the notice should\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\naddress certain rights of employers. The\nnotice is intended to inform employees\nof their rights, not those of their\nemployers.\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the\nBoard finds it unnecessary to modify the\nsection of the notice summarizing\nemployees’ NLRA rights.\nc. The Examples of Unlawful Employer\nConduct in the Notice\nThe proposed notice contained the\nfollowing examples of unlawful\nconduct:\nUnder the NLRA, it is illegal for your\nemployer to:\nProhibit you from soliciting for a union\nduring non-work time, such as before or after\nwork or during break times; or from\ndistributing union literature during non-work\ntime, in non-work areas, such as parking lots\nor break rooms.\nQuestion you about your union support or\nactivities in a manner that discourages you\nfrom engaging in that activity.\nFire, demote, or transfer you, or reduce\nyour hours or change your shift, or otherwise\ntake adverse action against you, or threaten\nto take any of these actions, because you join\nor support a union, or because you engage in\nconcerted activity for mutual aid and\nprotection, or because you choose not to\nengage in any such activity.\nThreaten to close your workplace if\nworkers choose a union to represent them.\nPromise or grant promotions, pay raises, or\nother benefits to discourage or encourage\nunion support.\nProhibit you from wearing union hats,\nbuttons, t-shirts, and pins in the workplace\nexcept under special circumstances.\nSpy on or videotape peaceful union\nactivities and gatherings or pretend to do so.\n75 FR 80419.\nThe Board received limited comments\non six of the seven examples of\nunlawful employer conduct. As a\ngeneral matter, some comments contend\nthat the number of examples of\nemployer misconduct is\ndisproportionate compared to the\nexamples of union misconduct. 108 Most\nof the comments refer to the number of\nparagraphs devoted to illegal employer\nconduct (7) and the number of\nparagraphs devoted to illegal union\nconduct (5). Several comments indicate\nthat when one compares the employer\nmisconduct listed in Section 8(a) of the\nNLRA with union misconduct listed in\nSection 8(b), no such imbalance appears\nin the text of the statute. Several\ncomments provide additional examples\nof union misconduct that they say\nshould be included.\nAs with the notice’s statement of\naffirmative rights, some of the\n108 See, e.g., comments of COLLE, Baker &\nMcKenzie, National Association of Manufacturers,\nand American Trucking Association.\n54024 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nindividual provisions in this section of\nthe notice received numerous comments\nand suggestions for improvement. The\nvast majority of the comments about the\nspecific provisions are from\nrepresentatives of employers. Those\ncomments generally contend that the\nprovisions are overgeneralizations and\ndo not articulate the legal standard for\nevaluating allegations of unlawful\nconduct or indicate factual scenarios in\nwhich certain employer conduct may be\nlawful.\nAfter reviewing all of the comments,\nthe Board has decided to revise one of\nthe examples of unlawful employer\nconduct contained in the NPRM. The\nBoard concludes that the other\nprovisions, as proposed, are accurate\nand informative and, as with the notice\nas a whole, strike an appropriate\nbalance between being simultaneously\ninstructive and succinct.\nFurthermore, the Board sees no reason\nto add or subtract from the employer or\nunion illegal activity to make the two\nsections contain an equal number of\nparagraphs. The comment that argues\nthat no imbalance exists in the statute\nis correct, but the majority of violations\nunder Section 8(b) concern union\nconduct vis-à-vis employers, not\nconduct that impairs employees’ rights.\nThe notice of rights is intended to\nsummarize employer and union\nviolations against employees;\naccordingly, there is no need to alter the\nlist to include unlawful union activity\nagainst employers.\ni. No-Solicitation and No-Distribution\nRules\nThe Board received a few comments\nthat were critical of the proposed notice\nlanguage stating that an employer\ncannot lawfully prohibit employees\nfrom ‘‘soliciting for the union during\nnon-work time or distributing union\nliterature during non-work time, in nonwork\nareas.’’ The Service Employees\nInternational Union comments that\n‘‘solicitation’’ has a narrow meaning and\ninvolves asking someone to join the\nunion by signing an authorization card,\nwhich is subject to the restrictions\nsuggested in the notice. The comment\nsubmits that the notice should state that\nan employer cannot prohibit employees\nfrom ‘‘talking’’ about a union. The\ncomment suggests that ‘‘talking’’ is both\nmore accurate and is easier for\nemployees to understand than\n‘‘soliciting.’’\nThe remaining comments criticize the\nprovision for failing to note any\nlimitations on employees’ rights to\nsolicit and distribute, such as the\nlimited rights of off-duty employees,\nand limitations in retail and health care\nestablishments. One comment, in\nparticular, suggests the notice should\nadvise healthcare employees that they\ndo not enjoy a protected right to solicit\nin immediate patient care areas or\nwhere their activity might disturb\npatients. See Beth Israel Hosp. v. NLRB,\n437 U.S. 483 (1978). The comment\nproposes to include a qualification that\na hospital or other health care employer\nmay prohibit all solicitation in\nimmediate patient care areas or outside\nthose areas when necessary to avoid\ndisrupting health care operations or\ndisturbing patients. Another comment\nsuggests that the law in this area is so\ncomplex that no meaningful but\nsuccinct provision can be constructed,\nand therefore recommends deleting it\nentirely.\nThe Board disagrees with those\ncomments. The Board appreciates that\nunder case law, employees’ right to\nengage in solicitation and distribution of\nliterature is qualified in certain settings\nand accordingly that employers may, in\nsome situations, legally prohibit\nsolicitation or distribution of literature\neven during employees’ nonworking\ntime. Given the variety of circumstances\nin which the right to solicit and\ndistribute may be limited, however, the\nBoard has determined that limitations\non the size and format of the notice\npreclude the inclusion of factual\nsituations in which an employer may\nlawfully limit such activity. As stated\nabove, employees may contact the NLRB\nwith specific questions about the\nlawfulness of their employers’ rules\ngoverning solicitation and literature\ndistribution.\nTurning to the suggestion that the\nnotice should be modified to remove the\nreference to union solicitation in favor\nof a reference only to the right to engage\nin union talk, the Board agrees in part.\nThe Board distinguishes between\nsoliciting for a union, which generally\nmeans encouraging a co-worker to\nparticipate in supporting a union, and\nunion talk, which generally refers to\ndiscussions about the advantages and\ndisadvantages of unionization. Scripps\nMemorial Hosp., 347 NLRB 52 (2006).\nThe right to talk about terms and\nconditions of employment, which\nwould necessarily include union talk, is\nencompassed more specifically by the\n‘‘discussion’’ provision in the\naffirmative rights section of the notice.\nThat provision indicates that employees\nhave the right to ‘‘discuss your terms\nand conditions of employment or union\norganizing with your co-workers or a\nunion.’’ In order to maintain\nconsistency and clarity throughout the\nnotice, the Board agrees that some\nchange is necessary to the solicitation\nprovision. Accordingly, the final notice\nwill state that it is illegal for an\nemployer to ‘‘prohibit you from talking\nabout or soliciting for a union during\nnon-work time, such as before or after\nwork or during break times; or from\ndistributing union literature during nonwork\ntime, in non-work areas, such as\nparking lots or break rooms.’’\nii. Questioning Employees About Union\nActivity\nThe Board received one comment\nconcerning this provision, suggesting\nthat it was confusing. The Board\nbelieves the existing language is\nsufficiently clear.\niii. Taking Adverse Action Against\nEmployees for Engaging in Union-\nRelated Activity\nThe Board did not receive any\nspecific comments regarding this\nprovision.\niv. Threats To Close\nA few comments from employer\ngroups criticize the perceived\novergeneralization of this provision.\nThose comments note that, as with\nunlawful interrogation, a threat to close\nis evaluated under a totality of\ncircumstances, and that an employer is\npermitted to state the effects of\nunionization on the company so long as\nthe statement is based on demonstrably\nprobable consequences of unionization.\nThe Board agrees that the law in this\ngeneral area is complex and that\npredictions of plant closure based on\ndemonstrably probable consequences of\nunionization may be lawful. NLRB v.\nGissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 618\n(1969). However, the example in the\nproposed notice is not such a\nprediction; rather, the notice states that\nit is unlawful for an employer to\n‘‘threaten to close your workplace if\nworkers choose a union to represent\nthem.’’ Such a statement, which clearly\nindicates that the employer will close\nthe plant in retaliation against the\nemployees for choosing union\nrepresentation, is unlawful. Id. at 618–\n619. Thus, the Board finds it\nunnecessary to modify or delete this\nprovision of the notice.\nv. Promising Benefits\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nThe Board received one comment\naddressing this provision. The comment\nargues that the provision is ‘‘troubling’’\nbecause it may be interpreted by a\nreader to mean ‘‘anytime their employer\nseeks to make such improvements it\ndiscourages union support because\nimproved wages and benefits may\nreduce employee’s interest in a union.’’\nThe Board does not think such an\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54025\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\ninterpretation would be reasonable,\nbecause it is contrary to the plain\nlanguage of the notice. The notice states\nthat promises or grants of benefits ‘‘to\ndiscourage or encourage union support’’\nare unlawful. It would make little sense\nto use such language if the Board had\nmeant that any promises or grants of\nbenefits were unlawful, rather than only\nthose with the unlawful stated\npurposes. And stating that such\npromises or grants to * * * encourage\nunion support are unlawful necessarily\nimplies that not all promises and grants\nof benefits discourage union support.\nvi. Prohibitions on Union Insignia\nA few comments suggest that the\nprovision fails to illuminate the\nconditions under which ‘‘special\ncircumstances’’ may exist, including in\nhotels or retail establishments where the\ninsignia may interfere with the\nemployer’s public image, or when the\ninsignia is profane or vulgar. Another\ncomment indicates that the provision is\noverly broad because it does not reflect\nthat a violation depends on the work\nenvironment and the content of the\ninsignia. All the comments addressing\nthis provision suggest either adding\nmore detail to the provision to narrow\nits meaning, or striking the provision\nentirely.\nAgain, the Board disagrees.\nEmployees have a statutorily protected\nright to wear union insignia unless the\nemployer is able to demonstrate\n‘‘special circumstances’’ that justify a\nprohibition. Republic Aviation Corp. v.\nNLRB, 324 U.S. 793 (1945). For reasons\nof format, the notice cannot\naccommodate those comments\nsuggesting that this provision specify\ncases in which the Board has found\n‘‘special circumstances,’’ such as where\ninsignia might interfere with production\nor safety; where it conveys a message\nthat is obscene or disparages a\ncompany’s product or service; where it\ninterferes with an employer’s attempts\nto have its employees project a specific\nimage to customers; where it hinders\nproduction; where it causes disciplinary\nproblems in the plant; where it is in an\nimmediate patient care areas; or where\nit would have any other consequences\nthat would constitute special\ncircumstances under settled precedent.\nNLRB v. Mead Corp., 73 F.3d 74, 79 (6th\nCir. 1996), enfg. Escanaba Paper Co.,\n314 NLRB 732 (1994).\nGiven the lengthy list of potential\nspecial circumstances, the addition of\none or two examples of special\ncircumstances might mislead or confuse\nemployees into thinking that the right to\nwear union insignia in all other\ncircumstances was absolute. And\nincluding an entire list of special\ncircumstances, concerning both the\nwearing of union insignia and other\nmatters (e.g., striking and picketing,\nsoliciting and distributing union\nliterature), would make it impossible to\nsummarize NLRA rights on an 11x17\ninch poster. In any event, the Board\nfinds that the general caveat that special\ncircumstances may defeat the\napplication of the general rule, coupled\nwith the advice to employees to contact\nthe NLRB with specific questions about\nparticular issues, achieves the balance\nrequired for an employee notice of\nrights about wearing union insignia in\nthe workplace.\nvii. Spying or Videotaping\nAside from the few comments that\nsuggest the provision be stricken, only\none comment specifically addresses the\ncontent of this provision. The comment\nstates that the language is confusing\nbecause a ‘‘supervisor might believe it\nwould be permissible to photograph or\ntape record a union meeting. Another\nmight say that their video camera\ndoesn’t use tape so it’s okay to use.’’ The\nBoard has determined that no change is\nnecessary. In the Board’s view, it is\nunlikely that a reasonable supervisor\nwould construe this notice language\n(which also says that it is unlawful to\n‘‘spy on’’ employees’ peaceful union\nactivities) as indicating that it is\nunlawful to videotape, but lawful to\ntape record or photograph, such\nactivities. Supervisors are free to contact\nthe Board if they are unsure whether a\ncontemplated response to union activity\nmight be unlawful.\nviii. Other Suggested Additions to\nIllegal Employer Conduct\nThe Heritage Foundation suggests that\nthe Board add language to the notice\ninforming employees that if they choose\nto be represented by a union, their\nemployer may not give them raises or\nbonuses for good performance without\nfirst bargaining with the union. The\ncomment suggests that the Board add\nthe following provision ‘‘if a union\nrepresents you and your co-workers,\ngive you a pay raise or a bonus, or\nreduce or dock your pay, without\nnegotiating with the union.’’ The Board\nrejects this suggestion for the same\nreason it rejects other comments\ncontending that the notice should\ninclude the consequences of\nunionization in the summary of NLRA\nrights, above.\nThe National Immigration Law Center\nsuggests that the Board add the\nfollowing to the notice poster:\nUnder the NLRA, it is illegal for your\nemployer to: Report you or threaten to report\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nyou to Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement (ICE) or to other law\nenforcement authorities in order to\nintimidate or retaliate against you because\nyou join or support a union, or because you\nengage in concerted activity for mutual aid\nand protection.\nThe Board finds it unnecessary to add\nthis statement. The notice states that it\nis unlawful for an employer to ‘‘fire,\ndemote, or transfer you, or reduce your\nhours or change your shift, or otherwise\ntake adverse action against you, or\nthreaten to take any of these actions,\nbecause you join or support a union, or\nbecause you engage in concerted\nactivity for mutual aid and protection\n(emphasis added) [.]’’ Reporting or\nthreatening to report an employee in the\nmanner described in the comment\nwould be a form of adverse action or\nthreat thereof, and the Board believes\nthat it would be understood as such.\nd. Examples of Illegal Union Activity\nThe proposed notice contained the\nfollowing examples of unlawful union\nconduct:\nUnder the NLRA, it is illegal for a\nunion or for the union that represents\nyou in bargaining with your employer\nto:\nThreaten you that you will lose your job\nunless you support the union.\nRefuse to process a grievance because you\nhave criticized union officials or because you\nare not a member of the union.\nUse or maintain discriminatory standards\nor procedures in making job referrals from a\nhiring hall.\nCause or attempt to cause an employer to\ndiscriminate against you because of your\nunion-related activity.\nTake other adverse action against you\nbased on whether you have joined or support\nthe union.\n75 FR 80419.\nThere were only a few comments\naddressing specific changes to the\nlanguage in this section of the notice.\nALFA criticizes the provision that states\nthat a union may not ‘‘threaten you that\nyou will lose your job unless you\nsupport the union,’’ because the\nproposed language ‘‘fails to capture\nSection 8(b)(1)(A)’s broader prohibition\nagainst restraint and coercion.’’ The\ncomment suggests revising the language\nto state that a union may not ‘‘[r]estrain\nor coerce you in the exercise of your\nright to refrain from joining a union by\nthreatening to inflict bodily harm or\nfollowing you to your home and\nrefusing to leave unless you sign a\nunion card.’’ That comment also\nsuggests adding a provision stating that\nit is unlawful for a union to ‘‘promise\nto waive your union initiation fee if you\nagree to sign a union card before a vote\nis taken.’’\n54026 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nAnother comment argues that the\nillegal union conduct portion of the\nnotice fails to fully inform employees of\ntheir rights as union members. 109 In\ncontrast, another comment states a\ndifferent position—that the list of illegal\nunion conduct ‘‘ostensibly relates only\nto restraint or coercion by a union in a\nunionized environment.’’ 110 The\ncomment further states that the Board\nshould have included examples of\n‘‘union restraint or coercion in an\norganizing setting’’ but gives no specific\nexamples.\nALFA suggests three changes to the\nunlawful union activity section. First,\nrather than say that the union may not\n‘‘threaten you that you will lose your\njob,’’ a more comprehensive statement\nwould be ‘‘threaten, harass, or coerce\nyou in order to gain your support for the\nunion.’’ The Board agrees, except as\nregards ‘‘harass,’’ which is sometimes\nused to characterize almost any sort of\nunion solicitation. Accordingly, the\nstatement will be modified to read\n‘‘threaten or coerce you in order to gain\nyour support for the union.’’ Second,\nthe comment suggests changing ‘‘cause\nor attempt to cause an employer to\ndiscriminate against you’’ to\n‘‘discriminate or attempt to discriminate\nagainst you because you don’t support\na union.’’ The Board disagrees, because\nthe suggested change would shift the\nfocus of the provision away from the\nsort of conduct contemplated in the\nrule. See NLRA Section 8(b)(2), 29\nU.S.C. 158(b)(2). Third, the comment\nsuggests changing ‘‘take other adverse\naction against you based on whether\nyou have joined or support the union’’\nto ‘‘take adverse action against you\nbecause you have not joined or do not\nsupport the union.’’ The Board agrees\nand will modify this provision of the\nnotice accordingly.\nBaker & McKenzie urges that a variety\nof other examples of unlawful union\nconduct be added to the notice,\nincluding requiring nonmembers to pay\na fee to receive contract benefits,\ndisciplining members for engaging in\nactivity adverse to a union-represented\ngrievant, disciplining members for\nrefusing to engage in unprotected\nactivity, engaging in careless grievance\nhandling, failing to notify employees of\ntheir Beck rights, requiring employees to\nagree to dues checkoff instead of direct\npayment, discriminatorily applying\nhiring hall rules, and conditioning\ncontinued employment on the payment\nof a fine or dues in ‘‘right-to-work’’\nstates.\n109 See comment of National Association of\nManufacturers.\n110 See comment of ALFA.\nAs with the examples of unlawful\nemployer activity, the Board concludes\nthat the provisions concerning unlawful\nunion activity, as proposed, are accurate\nand informative, and, as with the notice\nas a whole, strike an appropriate\nbalance between being simultaneously\ninstructive and succinct. Moreover, the\nBoard finds it unnecessary to include\nadditional examples of unlawful\nconduct so that the lists of employer\nand union activity are the same length\nbecause the notice describes the central\nforms of unlawful conduct engaged in\nby each type of entity. Still less is it\nnecessary to add a host of additional\nexamples of unlawful union conduct,\nwith the result that the list of such\nconduct would be much longer than the\nlist of unlawful employer conduct. In\nthe Board’s view, the list of unlawful\nunion conduct in the proposed notice\nfairly informs employees of the types of\nconduct that a union is prohibited from\nengaging in without providing\nunnecessary or confusing examples.\nEmployees may contact the NLRB if\nthey believe a union has violated the\nNLRA.\ne. Collective-Bargaining Provision\nThe collective-bargaining provision of\nthe NPRM states that ‘‘if you and your\nco-workers select a union to act as your\ncollective bargaining representatives,\nyour employer and the union are\nrequired to bargain in good faith and in\na genuine effort to reach a written,\nbinding agreement setting your terms\nand conditions of employment. The\nunion is required to fairly represent you\nin bargaining and enforcing the\nagreement.’’ 75 FR 80419.\nThe Board received only a few\ncomments on this provision of the\nnotice. Notably, COLLE requests the\ninclusion of a limitation on the\nprovision that employees have the right\nto bargain collectively, in order to\nclarify that the employer’s obligation is\nonly to bargain in good faith and not\nnecessarily to reach an agreement. A\nsecond comment suggests that the\nnotice inform employees that they have\nthe right to ‘‘sue a union for unfairly\nrepresenting the employee in\nbargaining, contract administration, or a\ndiscrimination matter.’’\nThe Board has decided that no\nchanges are necessary to the duty to\nbargain paragraph. The Board is\nsatisfied that the proposed collectivebargaining\nprovision provides sufficient\nguidance to employees about the\nexercise of these rights while still\nstaying within the constraints set by a\nnecessarily brief employee notice. As to\nthe first comment, the notice states that\nan employer and union have a duty to\n‘‘bargain in good faith and in a genuine\neffort to reach a written, binding\nagreement.’’ As discussed above, by\nreferring to a ‘‘genuine effort’’ to reach\nagreement, the notice necessarily\nimplies that the parties are not obliged\nto actually reach one. The duty to\nbargain in good faith has many\ncomponents. See NLRB v. Katz, 369 U.S.\n736 (1962). And the suggestion that\nemployers do not have to agree to\ncertain proposals, although correct, does\nnot account for the line of cases that\nsuggest that an important ingredient in\ngood faith bargaining is a willingness to\ncompromise. See Phelps Dodge, 337\nNLRB 455 (2002).\nTurning to the suggestion that the\nnotice include language informing\nemployees of their right to ‘‘sue’’ the\nunion if it fails to represent them fairly,\nthe Board has concluded that the notice\nsufficiently apprises employees of their\nright to fair representation and of their\nright to file unfair labor practice charges\nwith the Board should a union fail to\nfulfill that duty. The rights that\nemployees have to sue unions directly\nin court without coming to the Board\nare beyond the scope of this rulemaking.\nf. Coverage Provision\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nIn regard to coverage under the NLRA,\nthe proposed notice states:\nThe National Labor Relations Act covers\nmost private-sector employers. Excluded\nfrom coverage under the NLRA are publicsector\nemployees, agricultural and domestic\nworkers, independent contractors, workers\nemployed by a parent or spouse, employees\nof air and rail carriers covered by the Railway\nLabor Act, and supervisors (although\nsupervisors that have been discriminated\nagainst for refusing to violate the NLRA may\nbe covered). 75 FR 80419.\nA comment from the National\nImmigration Law Center suggests adding\nthe following language: ‘‘The NLRA\nprotects the above-enumerated rights of\nall employees, irrespective of their\nimmigration status. That protection\nextends to employees without work\nauthorization, though certain remedies\nin those circumstances may be limited.\nEmployers cannot threaten you or\nintimidate you on the basis of you\nimmigration status to prevent you from\njoining or supporting a union, or\nengaging in concerted activity for\nmutual aid and protection.’’\nThe Board has decided not to amend\nthe coverage provision in the final\nnotice. Although the Board understands\nthat many immigrant employees may be\nunsure whether they are covered by the\nNLRA, the notice does not include a list\nof covered employees. Including\nspecific coverage of immigrants, but not\nother classes of employees, may cause\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54027\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nconfusion for many employees.\nCurrently, the language in the notice\ntracks statutory language and provides\nonly the list of employees excluded\nfrom coverage. As a result, those\nemployees not listed under the\nexclusions will reasonably believe they\nare covered employees under the\nstatute. Any employees who are unsure\nof their status should contact a regional\noffice of the NLRB.\nThe final notice as modified is set\nforth in the Appendix to Subpart A of\nthis rule.\n2. Posting Issues\nThe Board proposed that the notice to\nemployees shall be at least 11 inches by\n17 inches in size, and in such colors and\ntype size and style as the Board shall\nprescribe. The proposed rule further\nprovides that employers that choose to\nprint the notice after downloading it\nfrom the Board’s Web site must print in\ncolor, and the printed notice shall be at\nleast 11 inches by 17 inches in size.\nProposed § 104.202(d) requires all\ncovered employers to post the employee\nnotice physically ‘‘in conspicuous\nplaces, including all places where\nnotices to employees are customarily\nposted.’’ Employers must take steps to\nensure that the notice is not altered,\ndefaced, or covered with other material.\nProposed § 104.202(e) states that the\nBoard will print the notice poster and\nprovide copies to employers on request.\nIt also states that employers may\ndownload copies of the poster from the\nBoard’s Web site, http://www.nlrb.gov,\nfor their use. It further provides that\nemployers may reproduce exact\nduplicates of the poster supplied by the\nBoard, and that they may also use\ncommercial poster services to provide\nthe employee notice consolidated onto\none poster with other Federally\nmandated labor and employment\nnotices, as long as consolidation does\nnot alter the size, color, or content of the\nposter provided by the Board. Finally,\nemployers that have significant numbers\nof employees who are not proficient in\nEnglish will be required to post notices\nof employee rights in the language or\nlanguages spoken by significant\nnumbers of those employees. The Board\nwill make available posters containing\nthe necessary translations.\nIn addition to requiring physical\nposting of paper notices, proposed\n§ 104.202(f) requires that notices be\ndistributed electronically, such as by e-\nmail, posting on an intranet or an\ninternet site, and/or other electronic\nmeans, if the employer customarily\ncommunicates with its employees by\nsuch means. 111 An employer that\ncustomarily posts notices to its\nemployees on an intranet or internet site\nmust display the required employee\nnotice on such a site prominently—i.e.,\nno less prominently than other notices\nto employees. The Board proposed to\ngive employers two options to satisfy\nthis requirement. An employer may\neither download the notice itself and\npost it in the manner described above,\nor post, in the same manner, a link to\nthe Board’s Web site that contains the\nfull text of the required employee\nnotice. In the latter case, the proposed\nrule states that the link must contain the\nprescribed introductory language from\nthe poster, which appears in Appendix\nto Subpart A, below. An employer that\ncustomarily communicates with its\nemployees by e-mail will satisfy the\nelectronic posting requirement by\nsending its employees an e-mail\nmessage containing the link described\nabove.\nThe proposed rule provides that,\nwhere a significant number of an\nemployer’s employees are not proficient\nin English, the employer must provide\nthe required electronic notice in the\nlanguage the employees speak. This\nrequirement can be met either by\ndownloading and posting, as required in\n§ 104.202(f), the translated version of\nthe notice supplied by the Board, or by\nprominently displaying, as required in\n§ 104.202(f), a link to the Board’s Web\nsite that contains the full text of the\nposter in the language the employees\nspeak.

As under the\nDepartment of Labor’s notice posting\nrequirement, 114 the Board’s final rule\nclarifies that the notice must be posted\nwherever notices to employees\nregarding personnel rules and policies\nare customarily posted and are readily\nseen by employees, not simply where\nother legally mandated notices are\nposted.\nA number of comments from\nemployers 115 and individuals take the\nposition that it is time to move away\nfrom paper posters and to encourage\nemployees to inform themselves of their\nrights through the Internet. Many\ncomments object that the posting\nrequirement will add to already\ncluttered bulletin boards or necessitate\nadditional bulletin boards. 116 The Board\nresponds to these comments above in\nsection II, subsection C, Factual Support\nfor the Rule.

Caremaster Medical\nServices’ comment asks whether\nperiodic inspections of the notices will\nbe conducted and, if so, by whom.\nSpecifically, this comment expresses\nconcern that employers will be forced to\npermit union officials to enter their\nfacilities to inspect the notices. The rule\ndoes not provide for such inspections or\nalter current standards regarding union\naccess to employers’ premises. Rather,\nthe Board contemplates that an\nemployer’s failure to comply with the\nrule will be brought to the attention of\nthe employer or the Board by employees\nor union representatives who are\nlawfully on the premises.\nThe International Union of Operating\nEngineers comments that the rule needs\nto apply to the marine construction\nindustry, in which employees work at\nremote sites and do not necessarily see\na posting in the office. Another\ncomment similarly states that the rule is\nnot practical for small employers with\ndispersed employees, e.g., trucking or\ninsurance companies. 117 Similarly, one\ncomment contends that the requirement\nis burdensome for construction\nemployers, whose employees report to\nvarious worksites. 118 The Board\nrecognizes that certain work situations,\nsuch as those mentioned in the\ncomments, present special challenges\nwith regard to physical posting.\nHowever, the Board concludes that\nthese employers must nonetheless post\nthe required notice at their work\npremises in accordance with the\nproposed rule. Electronic posting will\nalso aid the employers in providing the\nnotice to their employees in the manner\nin which they customarily communicate\nwith them.\nTLC Companies contends that\nprofessional employer organizations\n(PEOs) such as itself should be exempt\nfrom the rule’s requirements. It explains\nthat PEOs are ‘‘co-employers’’ of a client\nemployer’s employees, providing\npayroll and other administrative\nservices. However, it asserts that PEOs\nhave no control over the client\nemployer’s worksite. Accordingly, TLC\nCompanies is concerned that a PEO\ncould be found liable for its client’s\nfailure to post the notice. The Board\ncontemplates that employers will be\nrequired to physically post a notice only\non their own premises or at worksites\nwhere the employer has the ability to\n117 Comment of TLC Companies.\n118 Comment of NAI Electrical Contractors.\npost a notice or cause a notice to be\nposted directed to its own employees.\nRetail Industry Leaders Association\nasks whether the rule would apply to\noverseas employees of American\nemployers. The answer to that question\nis generally ‘‘no’’; the Board’s\njurisdiction does not extend to\nAmerican employees engaged in\npermanent employment abroad in\nlocations over which the United States\nhas no legislative control. See Computer\nSciences Raytheon, 318 NLRB 966\n(1995). Employers of employees who are\nworking abroad only temporarily are not\nrequired to post the notice in foreign\nworkplaces.\nb. Size and Form Requirements\nMany comments from organizations\nand individuals object to the 11x17-inch\nsize prescribed by the proposed rule. 119\nThey argue that most employers do not\nhave the capacity to make 11x17-inch\ncolor copies and will have to use\ncommercial copy services, which some\ncontend are expensive. A human\nresources official also asserts that other\nrequired notices are smaller, and that\nthe larger poster will be more eyecatching,\nimplying that NLRA rights are\nmore important. Other comments\nsupport the proposed 11x17-inch size,\nstating that the notice should stand out\nand be in large print, with one comment\nspecifying that the title should be\nlarger. 120 The AFL–CIO argues that\nemployers should not be permitted to\ndownload the notice from the Board’s\nWeb site if their limited printing\ncapacity would make it less eyecatching.\nA few comments contend that the\nprescribed size will make it difficult to\ninclude in consolidated posters of\nvarious statutory rights, as the proposed\nrule permits. 121 One comment urges the\nBoard to follow the ‘‘3′ rule,’’ according\nto which a notice is large enough if it\ncan be read from a distance of 3 feet, 122\nand another suggests only a legibility\nrequirement. 123 One comment states\nthat minor deviations, such as 1 ⁄4 inch,\nshould not be deemed violations. 124\nAnother comment expresses a concern\nthat a large, prominent poster could\ncause a few unhappy employees to\nbegin activity that could result in\ndivisiveness in a small facility. 125\n119 See, e.g., comment of Associated General\nContractors (AGC) of Iowa.\n120 See, e.g., comments of AFL–CIO and three\nGeorgetown University Law Center students.\n121 See, e.g., comment of Sinnissippi Centers.\n122 AGC of Iowa.\n123 Sinnissippi Centers.\n124 National Council of Agricultural Employers.\n125 Mercy Center Nursing Unit Inc.\nThe Board has decided to retain the\n11x17-inch poster size. As the NPRM\nstates, the Board will furnish paper\ncopies of the notice, at no charge, to\nemployers that ask for them. Employers\nthat prefer to download and print the\nnotice from the Board’s Web site will\nhave two formats available: a one-page\n11x17-inch version and a two-page 8\n1\n⁄2x11-inch version, which must be\nprinted in landscape format and taped\ntogether to form the 11x17-inch poster.\nIn response to the comments objecting\nto the added expense of obtaining color\ncopies through outside sources, the\nBoard has revised the rule to delete the\nrequirement that reproductions of the\nnotice be in color, provided that the\nreproductions otherwise conform to the\nBoard-provided notice. Accordingly, the\nBoard concludes that obtaining copies\nof the notice will not be difficult or\nexpensive for employers.\nThe Board finds no merit to the other\nobjections to the 11x17-inch poster size.\nContrary to some comments, the Board\ndoes not believe that employees would\nthink that NLRA rights are more\nimportant than other statutory rights,\nmerely because the notice of NLRA\nrights is somewhat larger than notices\nprescribed under some other statutes. It\nwould seem that, upon learning of all of\ntheir rights in the workplace, employees\nwill determine from their understanding\nof the rights themselves, rather than the\nsize of the various posters, which rights\n(if any) are more important to them than\nothers. In the Board’s view, adopting a\nsubjective ‘‘3′ rule’’ or a ‘‘legibility\nstandard’’ could lead to disagreements\nover whether a particular poster was\n‘‘legible’’ or could be read at a distance\nof 3 feet. In addition, if, as some\ncomments contend (without citing\nspecifics), the size of the Board’s notice\nwill pose a problem for manufacturers\nof consolidated posters to include it\nwith posters detailing other workplace\nrights, that would seem to be a problem\nbest left to those manufacturers to solve.\nc.

Another\ncomment urges that translated notices\nbe required whenever any of the\nemployees are not proficient in\nEnglish. 128 The U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce asserts that a safe harbor is\nneeded for employers when a notice in\na particular language is not yet available\nfrom the Board. Moreover, a few\ncomments contend that the Board\nshould also provide Braille notices for\nvision-impaired employees, as well as\naudio versions for illiterate employees,\nand versions of the notice that are\nadaptable to assistive technologies. 129\nOne individual proposes that the rule\nmandate that employers read the notice\nto employees when they are hired and\nto all employees annually.\nHaving carefully considered the\ncomments, the Board has decided to\ndefine ‘‘significant’’ in terms of foreignlanguage\nspeakers as 20 percent or more\nof an employer’s workforce. Thus, if as\nmany as 20 percent of an employer’s\nemployees are not proficient in English\nbut speak the same foreign language, the\nemployer must post the notice in that\nlanguage, both physically and\nelectronically (if the employer is\notherwise required to post the notice\nelectronically). If an employer’s\nworkforce includes two or more groups\nconstituting at least 20 percent of the\nworkforce who speak different\nlanguages, the employer must either\nphysically post the notice in each of\nthose languages or, at the employer’s\noption, post the notice in the language\nspoken by the largest group of\nemployees and provide each employee\nin each of the other language groups a\ncopy of the notice in the appropriate\nlanguage. If such an employer is also\nrequired to post the notice\nelectronically, it must do so in each of\nthose languages. If some of an\nemployer’s employees speak a language\nnot spoken by employees constituting at\nleast 20 percent of the employer’s\nworkforce, the employer is encouraged,\nbut not required, either to provide the\n126 See, e.g., comments of National Immigration\nLaw Center, Legal Aid Society—Employment Law\nCenter, and La Raza Centro Legal; Filipino\nAdvocates for Justice.\n127 See, e.g., comments of COLLE; Food Marketing\nInstitute (FMI).\n128 Georgetown law students.\n129 See, e.g., Baker & McKenzie; Heritage\nFoundation; Georgetown law students.\nnotice to those employees in their\nrespective language or languages or to\ndirect them to the Board’s Web site,\nhttp://www.nlrb.gov, where they can\nobtain copies of the notice in their\nrespective languages. The Board has\nalso decided to add to the notice\ninstructions for obtaining foreignlanguage\ntranslations of the notice.\nEmployers will be required to request\nforeign-language notices from the Board\nor obtain them from the Board’s Web\nsite in the same manner as the Englishlanguage\nnotice. If an employer requests\nfrom the Board a notice in a particular\nlanguage in which the notice is not\navailable, the requesting employer will\nnot be liable for non-compliance with\nthe rule until the notice becomes\navailable in that language.\nWith respect to employees who are\nvision-impaired or those who are\nilliterate, employers may consult the\nBoard’s Regional Office on a case-bycase\nbasis for guidance on appropriate\nmethods of providing the required\nnotice, including by audio recording.\nd. Electronic Posting\nMany employer comments oppose the\nrequirement for electronic notice. The\nCoalition for a Democratic Workplace\npoints out that other agencies do not\nrequire both electronic and physical\nposting and asserts that only one\nmethod is necessary. For example, the\nCoalition notes that the Family and\nMedical Leave Act notice obligation is\nsatisfied by electronic posting alone,\nand other statutes do not mention\nelectronic posting. The National Council\nof Agricultural Employers urges the\nBoard to require electronic posting only\nif the employer posts other statutory or\nregulatory notices in that fashion.\nAnother proposes that employers be\npermitted to choose either physical or\nelectronic posting. The National\nAssociation of Manufacturers remarks\nthat the proposed rule breaks new\nground for using an employer’s email\nsystem to communicate information\nabout ‘‘union membership.’’ The U.S.\nChamber of Commerce suggests that this\naspect of the rule would chill\nemployers’ use of new technologies. On\nthe other hand, the AFL–CIO and\nseveral other commenters 130 support\nelectronic as well as physical posting;\nthe Center for American Progress Action\nFund, among others, points out that\nelectronic communications at work are\nstandard now.\nAfter carefully considering these\ncomments, the Board concludes that\nelectronic posting will substantially\n130 See, e.g., comments of Gibson, Dunn, Cohen,\nLeifer & Yellig, P.C.; Beeson, Tayer & Bodine.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nassist in providing the prescribed notice\nto employees. As some comments state,\nelectronic communication is now a\nroutine practice in many workplaces\nand the source of much information\nfrom employers to their employees.\nHowever, the Board has clarified the\nfinal rule to mandate only that, if an\nemployer customarily communicates\npersonnel rules or policies to its\nemployees in that manner, it must also\ndo so with respect to the notice of\nemployee rights under the NLRA. The\nconcern that the rule will discourage\nemployers from using new technologies\nis apparently not widely shared and, in\nthe Board’s view, is implausible.\nAlthough the Board recognizes that\nsome other statutes and regulations do\nnot require electronic notice, it notes\nthat they generally predated the routine\nuse of electronic communications in the\nworkplace. Having only recently begun\nordering electronic posting of remedial\nnotices, 131 the Board has limited\nexperience in this area, and employers\nare encouraged to contact the local\nRegional Office with questions about\nthis provision. The Board does not agree\nthat employers should be permitted to\nchoose whether to provide physical or\nelectronic notice, because some\nemployers could select the less effective\nof these alternatives, thus undermining\nthe purpose of the rule. Finally, the\nrights stated in the notice are not\naccurately described as pertaining solely\nto union membership, and the notice is\nnot intended to promote union\nmembership or union representation.\nRather, the notice addresses a broad\nrange of employee legal rights under the\nNLRA, which involve protected\nconcerted activity as well as union\nactivity in both organized and\nunorganized workplaces, and also the\nright to refrain from any such activity.\nMany employer comments note that\nthe proposed rule also does not define\n‘‘customarily’’ as it pertains to\nelectronic posting in § 104.202(f), i.e.,\nthe type and degree of communication\nthat triggers the requirement. 132\nNumerous employers also participated\nin a postcard campaign objecting,\namong other things, that employers use\na wide variety of technology to\ncommunicate with employees and that\nthe rule could require them to use all\nmethods to convey the notice. 133 For\n131 J.

The\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce raises the\nsame issue regarding faxing, voice mail,\nand instant messaging. The National\nRoofing Contractors Association notes\nthat some employers use email to\ncommunicate with certain employees,\nwhile other employees have no access to\nemail during their work day. As to email\ncommunication itself, an individual\nobserves that many employees change\njobs every 3 to 4 years, and an email\nreaches only those in the workforce at\na specific time. The same comment\nnotes that the proposed rule does not\nstate when or how often email notice\nshould be provided. Three Georgetown\nlaw students recommend that the rule\nmandate email as well as intranet notice\nto employees when it goes into effect\nand written notice to new employees\nwithin a week of their starting\nemployment.\nThe Board responds that, as discussed\nabove regarding the location of posting,\n‘‘customarily’’ is used in its normal\nmeaning. This provision of the rule\nwould not apply to an employer that\nonly occasionally uses electronic means\nto communicate with employees.\nHowever, in view of the numerous\ncomments expressing concern over the\nproposed rule’s email posting\nrequirements, the Board has decided not\nto require employers to provide the\nnotice to employees by means of email\nand the other forms of electronic\ncommunication listed in the previous\nparagraph. In the Board’s judgment, the\npotential for confusion and the prospect\nof requiring repeated notifications in\norder to reach new employees outweigh\nthe benefits that could be derived at the\nmargin from such notifications. All\nemployers subject to the rule will be\nrequired to post the notice physically in\ntheir facilities; and employers who\ncustomarily post notices to employees\nregarding personnel rules or policies on\nan internet or intranet site will be\nrequired to post the Board’s notice on\nthose sites as well. Moreover, those\nnotices (unlike the Board’s election and\nremedial notices) must remain posted;\nthus, it is reasonable to expect that even\nthough some employees may not see the\nnotices immediately, more and more\nwill see them and learn about their\nNLRA rights as time goes by.\nAccordingly, the only electronic\nMount Sterling, Kentucky Chamber of Commerce;\nU.S. Xpress, Inc.\npostings required under the final rule\nwill be those on internet or intranet\nsites.\nMany comments address the\ncharacteristics of electronic posting, as\nprescribed in § 104.202(f). In the NPRM,\nthe Board proposed not to prescribe the\nsize, clarity, location, or brightness of an\nelectronic notice or link to the notice,\nbut rather require that it be at least as\nprominent as other electronic notices to\nemployees, as the Department of Labor’s\nrule requires. No comments suggest\nmore specific requirements; the\nMichigan Health & Hospital Association\nargues that such requirements would\nresult in inadvertent noncompliance.\nThe Board has decided to adopt the\nDepartment of Labor’s approach, as\nproposed in the NPRM.\nBaker & McKenzie urges that the title\nof the link in the proposed rule be\nchanged to ‘‘Employee Rights under the\nNational Labor Relations Act’’ rather\nthan ‘‘Important Notice about\nEmployees Rights to Organize and\nBargain Collectively with Their\nEmployers.’’ The Board agrees and has\nrevised the rule accordingly.\nA comment from Vigilant states that\na link to the Board’s Web site, which is\none means of electronic posting, should\nnot be required to include the\nintroductory language of the notice. The\nBoard agrees, noting that the\nDepartment of Labor takes this\napproach, and will not require that\nelectronic links to the Board’s Web site\ninclude the introductory language.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board\nhas decided to retain the posting\nrequirements as proposed in the NPRM,\nmodified as indicated above.\ne. Compliance With the Department of\nLabor’s Rule\nSeveral comments opposing the\nproposed rule urge that, if the rule\nbecomes final, the Board should retain\nthe ‘‘safe harbor’’ provided for Federal\ncontractors that comply with the\nDepartment of Labor’s notice posting\nrule. 134 However, the U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce states that some employers\npost the Department of Labor’s notice at\nfacilities where it is not required or\nwhere Federal contract work is\nperformed only sporadically. It\nquestions whether such employers must\nreplace the Department of Labor’s notice\nwith the Board’s when no contract work\nis being performed, or whether they can\ncomply with the Board’s rule by leaving\nthe Department of Labor’s notice in\nplace. The Chamber proposes that\n134 See, e.g., comments of IFDA; Estes; The Sack\nCompany; National Roofing Contractors\nAssociation.\nemployers be allowed to choose to\nmaintain the Department of Labor’s\nnotice, although another comment\nasserts that employees might think that\nthe notice is no longer applicable\nbecause of the lack of a current contract.\nAnother comment raises the possibility\nthat either the Board or the Department\nof Labor could decide to change its\nnotice and emphasized that they need to\nbe identical in order to provide the safe\nharbor. The Board responds that a\nFederal contractor that complies with\nthe Department of Labor’s noticeposting\nrule will be deemed in\ncompliance with the Board’s\nrequirement. 135\n3.

Under\nNLRA Section 2(2), ‘‘employer’’\nexcludes the United States government,\nany wholly owned government\ncorporation, any Federal Reserve Bank,\nany State or political subdivision, and\nany person subject to the Railway Labor\nAct, 45 U.S.C. 151 et seq. 29 U.S.C.\n152(2). Thus, under the proposed rule,\nthose excluded entities are not required\nto post the notice of employee rights.\nThe proposed rule also does not apply\nto entities that employ only individuals\nwho are not considered ‘‘employees’’\nunder the NLRA. See Subpart A, below;\n29 U.S.C. 152(3). Finally, the proposed\nrule does not apply to entities over\nwhich the Board has been found not to\nhave jurisdiction, or over which the\nBoard has chosen through regulation or\nadjudication not to assert\njurisdiction. 136 The Board proposed that\nall employers covered under the NLRA\nwould be subject to the notice posting\nrule. 75 FR 80413.\nThe Coalition for a Democratic\nWorkplace argues that the final rule\ncannot be applied to religiouslyaffiliated\nemployers. The Coalition\nargues that assertion of jurisdiction\nwould ‘‘substantially burden [such\nemployers’] exercise of religion in\nviolation of both the First Amendment\nand the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct.’’ Similarly, Seyfarth Shaw contends\nthat religiously-affiliated healthcare\n135 A few comments ask whether the Board’s rule\nwould preempt the Department of Labor’s rule.\nBecause the answer to that question would not\naffect the validity of the Board’s rule, the Board\nfinds it unnecessary to take a position on that issue\nin this proceeding.\n136 The proposed rule excludes small businesses\nwhose impact on interstate commerce is de minimis\nor so slight that they do not meet the Board’s\ndiscretionary jurisdiction requirements.

The Board has asserted\njurisdiction over some religiouslyaffiliated\nemployers in the past, but has\ndeclined to assert jurisdiction over other\nreligiously-affiliated employers. See,\ne.g., Ecclesiastical Maintenance Service,\n320 NLRB 70 (1995), and St. Edmund’s\nHigh School, 337 NLRB 1260 (2002). In\nUkiah Valley Medical Center, the Board\nfound that neither the First Amendment\nnor the Religious Restoration Act\nprecludes the Board from asserting\njurisdiction over a religiously-affiliated\nemployer. 332 NLRB 602 (2000). If an\nemployer is unsure whether the Board\nhas jurisdiction over its operations, it\nmay contact the Board’s regional office.\nIn its comment, the United Stated\nPostal Service points out that it has\ndifferent statutory rules from those\ncovering other private sector employees.\nLabor relations in the Postal Service are\ngoverned by Chapter 12 of the Postal\nReorganization Act of 1970, 39 U.S.C.\n1201 et seq. Section 1209(a) of the\nPostal Reorganization Act generally\nmakes the NLRA applicable to all\nemployee-management relations ‘‘to the\nextent not inconsistent with the\nprovisions of this title.’’ As raised by the\ncomment, there are indeed several areas\nin which the Postal Reorganization Act\nis inconsistent with the NLRA. The\nprincipal differences are that an agency\nshop is prohibited (id. section 1209(a))\nand that postal employees may not\nstrike. Id. Section\n410(b)(1)(incorporating 5 U.S.C. 7311).\nIn light of these differences, the Board\nagrees that a postal worker-specific\nnotice is necessary. The Board,\nhowever, does not wish to create a\nnotice without the benefit of specific\npublic comment on this issue.\nAccordingly, the Board will exclude the\nUnited States Postal Service from\ncoverage under the final rule; the Board\nmay, at a later date, request comments\non a postal worker-specific notice.\nSubpart B—Enforcement and\nComplaint Procedures\nSubpart B of the rule contains\nprocedures for enforcement of the\nemployee notice-posting requirement. In\ncrafting Subpart B, the Board was\nmindful of the need to identify an\neffective remedy for noncompliance\nwith the notice-posting requirement.\nThe Board gave careful consideration to\nseveral alternative approaches to\nenforcing the rule’s notice-posting\nrequirements. Those alternatives, not all\nof which are mutually exclusive, were\n(1) Finding the failure to post the\nrequired notices to be an unfair labor\npractice; (2) tolling the statute of\nlimitations for filing unfair labor\npractice charges against employers that\nfail to post the notices; (3) considering\nthe willful failure to post the notices as\nevidence of unlawful motive in unfair\nlabor practice cases; (4) voluntary\ncompliance. 75 FR 80413–80414.\nAs explained in the NPRM, the Board\nconsidered but tentatively rejected\nrelying solely on voluntary compliance.\nThis option logically would appear to be\nthe least conducive to an effective\nenforcement of the notice-posting\nrequirement, and the Board’s limited\nexperience with voluntary posting of\nnotices of employee rights seems to\nconfirm this. When an election petition\nis filed, the Board’s Regional Office\nsends the employer Form NLRB–5492,\nNotice to Employees, together with a\nleaflet containing significant ‘‘Rights of\nEmployees.’’ See the Board’s\nCasehandling Manual, Part Two—\nRepresentation Proceedings, Section\n11008.5, found on the Board’s Web site,\nhttp://www.nlrb.gov. The Regional\nOffice also asks employers to post the\nnotice of employee rights in the\nworkplace; however, the Board’s\nexperience is that the notices are seldom\nposted. Id. at 80414. Moreover, because\nthe notice is voluntary and there is no\nenforcement scheme, there is no remedy\nto fix the problem when the notice is\nnot posted. The Board has found\nnothing in the comments to the NPRM\nthat would give it reason to believe that\nvoluntary compliance would be any\nmore effective under the present notice\nrule. Therefore, the Board has decided\nnot to rely on voluntary compliance.\nInstead the final rule provides that\nfailing to post the notice may be found\nto be an unfair labor practice and may\nalso, in appropriate circumstances, be\ngrounds for tolling the statute of\nlimitations. In addition, a knowing and\nwillful failure to post employee notices\nmay be found to be evidence of\nunlawful motive in an unfair labor\npractice case. (As the Board also\nexplained in the NPRM, it did not\nconsider imposing monetary fines for\nnoncompliance, because the Board lacks\nthe statutory authority to impose\n‘‘penalties or fines.’’ See, e.g., Republic\nSteel Corp. v. NLRB, 311 U.S. 7, 10–12\n(1940).) These provisions have two\npurposes: to ensure that any violations\nof the notice-posting requirement that\noccur may be remedied where\nnecessary, and to describe how\nviolations of the notice-posting\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nrequirement may affect other Board\nproceedings. 137\nThe Board received several hundred\ncomments regarding the proposed\nmeans of enforcing the notice posting\nrequirement. Those that favor\nimplementing the rule also favor the\nproposed enforcement mechanisms. 138\nThose opposing the rule generally\noppose all three enforcement\nmechanisms.\nA. Noncompliance as an Unfair Labor\nPractice\nThe rule requires employers to inform\nemployees of their NLRA rights because\nthe Board believes that employees must\nknow their rights in order to exercise\nthem effectively. Accordingly, the Board\nmay find that an employer that fails or\nrefuses to post the required notice of\nemployee rights violates Section 8(a)(1)\nof the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1) by\n‘‘interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing], or\ncoerc[ing] employees in the exercise of\nthe rights guaranteed in section 7 (29\nU.S.C. 157).’’\nAs it explained in the NPRM, the\nBoard expects that most employers that\nfail to post the required notice will do\nso simply because they are unaware of\nthe rule, and that when it is called to\ntheir attention, they will comply\nwithout the need for formal\nadministrative action or litigation.\nWhen that is not the case, the Board’s\ncustomary procedures for investigating\nand adjudicating alleged unfair labor\npractices may be invoked. See NLRA\nSections 10 and 11, 29 U.S.C. 160, 161;\n29 CFR part 102, subpart B. 139 When the\nBoard finds a violation, it will\ncustomarily order the employer to cease\nand desist and to post the notice of\n137 The tolling and animus provisions are not\nremedies in the usual sense of the term; however,\nthese provisions inform the public of the impact\nthat violations of the notice posting obligation may\nhave in other NLRB proceedings. As described\nbelow, these impacts are not a ‘‘punishment’’ for\nnoncompliance. To the contrary, the tolling\nprovision is intended to ensure that noncompliance\nwith the notice posting requirement does not\nprejudice innocent employees. And the animus\nprovision is intended to inform the public that\nknowing and willful violations of the rule may\nsupport an inference of animus toward NLRA\nrights.\n138 See, e.g., Harkin and Miller, National\nEmployment Law Project, Public Justice Center, Inc.\n139 The Board’s General Counsel has\nunreviewable discretion as to whether to issue a\ncomplaint in an unfair labor practice proceeding.\nSee, e.g., Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 182 (1967).\nThe General Counsel has exercised that discretion\nto refuse to proceed with meritorious charges when\nit would not serve the purposes of the Act. See\nGeneral Counsel memoranda 02–08 and 95–15. This\ndiscretion includes dismissing any charge filed\nagainst an employer that is not covered by the\nBoard’s jurisdictional requirements.\n54032 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nemployee rights as well as a remedial\nnotice. 140 75 FR 80414.\nThe comments opposing this proposal\nmake three principal arguments. First,\nonly Congress, not the Board, has the\nauthority to ‘‘create a new unfair labor\npractice.’’ 141 Second, even if the Board\npossesses such authority, it has not\nidentified the Section 7 rights that\nwould be interfered with by an\nemployer’s failure to post the notice. 142\nThird, ‘‘interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing],\nor coerc[ing]’’ employees within the\nmeaning of NLRA Section 8(a)(1)\nnecessarily involves action, not failure\nto act; therefore, failure to post the\nnotice cannot violate Section 8(a)(1). 143\nThe Board finds no merit in any of these\ncontentions.\nTo begin with, it is incorrect to say\nthat the Board lacks the authority to find\nthat failure to post the notice violates\nSection 8(a)(1) without Congressional\napproval. It is true, as the Society for\nHuman Resource Management states,\nthat ‘‘Section 10(a) of the Act\nspecifically limits the NLRB’s powers to\npreventing only the unfair labor\npractices listed in Section 8 of the Act.\nSection 8 is silent regarding any notice\nposting requirement (emphasis in\noriginal).’’ However, as the Supreme\nCourt remarked long ago,\nThe [NLRA] did not undertake the\nimpossible task of specifying in precise and\nunmistakable language each incident which\nwould constitute an unfair labor practice. On\nthe contrary that Act left to the Board the\nwork of applying the Act’s general\nprohibitory language in the light of the\ninfinite combinations of events which might\nbe charged as violative of its terms. Thus a\n‘‘rigid scheme of remedies’’ is avoided and\nadministrative flexibility within appropriate\nstatutory limitations obtained to accomplish\nthe dominant purpose of the legislation.\nRepublic Aviation Corporation v. NLRB,\n324 U.S. 793, 798 (1945) (citation\nomitted). Accordingly, since its\ncreation, the Board in interpreting\nSection 8(a)(1) has found numerous\nactions as to which ‘‘Section 8 is\nsilent’’—e.g., coercively interrogating\nemployees about their protected\nconcerted activities, engaging in\n140 Consistent with precedent, it will be unlawful\nfor an employer to threaten or retaliate against an\nemployee for filing charges or testifying in a Board\nproceeding involving an alleged violation of the\nnotice-posting requirement.

Section 8 is equally silent\nconcerning unions’ duty to inform\nemployees of their rights under NLRB v.\nGeneral Motors, above, and\nCommunications Workers v. Beck,\nabove, before attempting to obligate\nthem pursuant to a union-security\nclause, yet the Board finds that a\nunion’s failure to provide that notice\nrestrains and coerces employees in\nviolation of Section 8(b)(1)(A).\nCalifornia Saw & Knife Works, above,\n320 NLRB at 233, 259, 261. 144\nBecause, as described in detail above,\nnotice posting is necessary to ensure\neffective exercise of Section 7 rights, a\nrefusal to post the required notice is at\nleast an interference with employees’\nexercise of those rights. For these\nreasons, in finding that an employer’s\nfailure to post the required notice\ninterferes with, restrains, or coerces\nemployees in the exercise of their NLRA\nrights, in violation of Section 8(a)(1), the\nBoard is acting consistently with its\nsettled practice. Some comments claim\nthat the Board has not identified any\nspecific Section 7 right to justify this\nremedy. But such specificity is not\nneeded, because all Section 7 rights are\nimplicated by an employer’s failure to\npost the required notice. As previously\nstated, there is a strong nexus between\nknowledge of Section 7 rights and their\nfree exercise. It therefore follows that an\nemployer’s failure to post this notice,\nwhich informs employees of their\nSection 7 rights, reasonably tends to\ninterfere with the exercise of such\nrights.\nFinally, although most violations of\nthe NLRA involve actions rather than\nfailures to act, there are instances in\nwhich a failure to act may be found to\ninterfere with, restrain, or coerce\nemployees in the exercise of their\nSection 7 rights. Thus, a union’s failure\nto provide the required notices under\nNLRB v. General Motors, above, and\n144 See Harkin and Miller. Although the Board\nsuggested in a footnote in California Saw that there\nwas no obligation to inform employees of their\nSection 7 rights, 320 NLRB at 232 n. 42, this dicta\nmerely indicated that no such obligation had yet\nbeen recognized in that particular context. To the\nextent it could be read as denying that such an\nobligation may exist, it is the considered view of the\nBoard that this reading must be rejected. Similarly,\nthe statement in U.S. Postal Service, 241 N.L.R.B.\n141, 152 (1979), regarding affirmative notice\nobligations is limited to Weingarten rights, and, in\nany event, does not suggest that notice of NLRA\nrights may never be required.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nCommunications Workers v. Beck,\nabove, violates Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the\nNLRA. California Saw & Knife Works,\nabove, 320 NLRB at 233, 259, 261. An\nemployer that fails or refuses to execute\nan agreed-to collective-bargaining\nagreement on request of the union\nviolates Section 8(d), 8(a)(5) and,\nderivatively, Section 8(a)(1). An\nemployer that fails to provide relevant\ninformation requested by the union that\nrepresents the employer’s employees\nviolates Section 8(a)(5) and (1). See, e.g.,\nNLRB v. Truitt Mfg. Co., 351 U.S. 149\n(1956).\nThe NLRA’s recognition that a failure\nto perform a legal duty may constitute\nunlawful interference, coercion or\nrestraint is not unique. Courts have\nexpressly held that the failure to post\nnotice required by regulation can be an\n‘‘interference’’ with employee Family\nand Medical Leave Act rights. In a\nprovision that ‘‘largely mimics th[e\nlanguage of] § 8(a)(1) of the NLRA,’’\nBachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, 259 F. 3d\n1112, 1123 (9th Cir. 2001), the FMLA\nstates that ‘‘[i]t shall be unlawful for any\nemployer to interfere with, restrain, or\ndeny the exercise of or the attempt to\nexercise, any right provided under this\ntitle.’’ 29 U.S.C. 2615(a)(1). In\ninterpreting this language, the\nDepartment of Labor’s regulations\nspecifically state that failure to post the\nrequired notice of FMLA rights ‘‘may\nconstitute an interference with,\nrestraint, or denial of the exercise of an\nemployee’s FMLA rights’’ under section\n2615(a)(1). 29 CFR 825.300(e). Courts\nhave agreed, finding that the failure to\nprovide FMLA notices is an ‘‘adverse\naction’’ against the employee that\nsupports a prima facie case of\ninterference. Greenwell v. Charles\nMachine Works, Inc., (W.D. Ok. April\n15, 2011); Smith v. Westchester County,\n(S.D.N.Y. February 14, 2011).\nAccordingly, the Board finds no\nimpediment to declaring that an\nemployer’s failure to post the required\nnotice will violate Section 8(a)(1). 145\nAs it explained in the NPRM,\nhowever, the Board expects that, in\npractice, few violations will be found\nfor failures to post the notice. The Board\nanticipates that most employers that fail\nto post the notice will do so because\nthey are unaware of the rule, and that\nwhen they learn about the rule, they\nwill post the notice without the need for\nformal administrative action or\nlitigation. 75 FR 80414. To that end,\n§ 104.212(a) of the rule states that if an\n145 ALFA contends that failure to post a Boardrequired\nnotice is not an unfair labor practice, but\nthe authorities cited do not support that\nproposition.\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54033\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nunfair labor practice charge is filed\nalleging failure to post the notice, ‘‘the\nRegional Director will make reasonable\nefforts to persuade the respondent\nemployer to post the * * * notice\nexpeditiously,’’ and that ‘‘[i]f the\nemployer does so, the Board expects\nthat there will rarely be a need for\nfurther administrative proceedings.’’ 75\nFR 80419.\nNumerous comments assert that\nfinding the failure to post the notice to\nbe an unfair labor practice is too harsh\na remedy, especially for small\nemployers that are more likely to be\nexcusably unaware of the rule. 146 As\njust stated, in practice it should almost\nnever be necessary for proceedings to\nreach that point. For the few employers\nthat may ultimately be found to have\nviolated Section 8(a)(1) by failing to post\nthe notice of employee rights, the only\ncertain consequences will be an order to\ncease and desist and that the notice and\na remedial notice be posted; those\nremedies do not strike the Board as\nsevere.\nMichigan Health & Hospital\nAssociation urges that an employer be\nallowed to correct an initial failure to\npost the notice without further\nconsequences; Fireside Distributors, Inc.\nagrees and asks that technical violations\nof the rule not be subject to a finding of\na violation. The Heritage Foundation\nbacks the same approach for inadvertent\nfailures to post. The Board disagrees. To\nrepeat, the Board anticipates that most\nemployers that inadvertently fail to post\nthe notice will do so on being informed\nof the posting requirement, and that in\nthose circumstances further proceedings\nwill rarely be required. However, the\nBoard believes that this matter is best\nhandled through the General Counsel’s\ntraditional exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion in accordance with the\ndirections given here.\nCalifornia Chamber and NCAE\ncontend that the Board should specify\nthe ‘‘reasonable efforts’’ a Regional\nDirector will make to persuade an\nemployer to post the notice when a\ncharge alleging a failure to post has been\nfiled. They propose that the rule be\namended to state that the Board will\nsend the employer at least two mailed\nletters, with the notice enclosed,\nrequesting that the employer post the\nnotice within a specified period of time,\npreferably 30 days. They also assert that\nthe Board must specify the\ncircumstances in which additional\nproceedings will be appropriate. The\nHeritage Foundation urges that\n§ 104.212(a) be modified to state that if\n146 See, e.g., comments of St Mar Enterprises, Inc.\nand National Federation of Independent Business.\nan employer promptly posts the notice,\n‘‘there will be no further administrative\nproceedings, unless the Board has\ninformation giving the Board reason to\nbelieve that the preceding failure to do\nso was intentional.’’ The Board rejects\nthese suggestions because they would\ncreate unnecessary obstacles to effective\nenforcement of the notice requirement.\nThat requirement is straightforward, and\ncompliance should be a simple matter.\nThe Board believes that the General\nCounsel should have discretion to\naddress particular cases of noncompliance\nefficiently and\nappropriately, depending upon the\ncircumstances.\nB. Tolling the Section 10(b) Statute of\nLimitations\nNLRA Section 10(b) provides in part\nthat ‘‘no complaint shall issue based\nupon any unfair labor practice occurring\nmore than six months prior to the filing\nof the charge with the Board[.]’’ 29\nU.S.C. 160(b). However, as the Board\nstated in the NPRM, the 6-month filing\nperiod does not begin to run until the\ncharging party has actual or constructive\nnotice of the allegedly unlawful\nconduct. See, e.g., John Morrell & Co.,\n304 NLRB 896, 899 (1991), review\ndenied 998 F.2d 7 (D.C. Cir. 1993)\n(table). 75 FR 80414. This makes\nintuitive sense, because it would be\nunfair to expect charges to be filed\nbefore the charging party could\nreasonably have known that the law was\nviolated. Similar concerns for fairness\njustify tolling the statute of limitations\nwhere an employee, although aware of\nthe conduct in question, is excusably\nunaware that the conduct is unlawful\nbecause mandatory notice was not given\nto the employee. The Board found that\nwidespread ignorance of NLRA rights\njustified requiring notice to be posted.\nThe Board cited the observation of the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit in a case involving the failure to\npost the notice required under the\nADEA, that ‘‘[t]he [ADEA] posting\nrequirement was undoubtedly created\nbecause Congress recognized that the\nvery persons protected by the Act might\nbe unaware of its existence.’’ Bonham v.\nDresser Industries, 569 F.2d 187, 193\n(1977), cert. denied 439 U.S. 821 (1978).\nAccordingly, the Board proposed that\ntolling the 10(b) period for filing unfair\nlabor practice charges might be\nappropriate where the required notice\nhas not been posted. 75 FR 80414. For\nthe reasons discussed below, the Board\nadheres to that view.\nSection 10(b) is a statute of\nlimitations, and statutes of limitations\nare presumed to include equitable\ntolling whenever the statute is silent or\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nambiguous on the issue.

United States, 535 U.S. 43, 49\n(2002) (‘‘It is hornbook law that\nlimitations periods are customarily\nsubject to equitable tolling, unless\ntolling would be inconsistent with the\ntext of the relevant statute.’’ (quotations\nand citations omitted)); Hallstrom v.\nTillamook County, 493 U.S. 20, 27\n(1989) (‘‘The running of such statutes is\ntraditionally subject to equitable\ntolling.’’); Honda v.

Brooklyn E.D.\nTerminal, 359 U.S. 231, 232–33 (1959)\n(equitable tolling of statutes of\nlimitations is ‘‘[d]eeply rooted in our\njurisprudence’’); Holmberg v.\nArmbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 396–97 (1946)\n(equitable tolling is ‘‘read into every\nfederal statute of limitation’’).\nIn Zipes, the Supreme Court held that\nthe timeliness provision of Title VII’s\ncharge-filing requirement was ‘‘subject\nto waiver, estoppel and equitable\ntolling.’’ 455 U.S. at 392–98. The\nSupreme Court expressly analogized to\nthe NLRA, and stated that Section10(b)\nwas not jurisdictional: ‘‘[T]he time\nrequirement for filing an unfair labor\npractice charge under the National\nLabor Relations Act operates as a statute\nof limitations subject to recognized\nequitable doctrines and not as a\nrestriction of the jurisdiction of the\nNational Labor Relations Board.’’ Id. at\nn.11. Zipes strongly supports the\nproposed rule. The analogy between\nTitle VII and the NLRA is well\nestablished, and neither the holding of\nZipes regarding Title VII nor Zipes’\ncharacterization of 10(b) has ever been\ncalled into doubt.\nNotices of employment rights are\nintended, in part, to advise employees\nof the kinds of conduct that may violate\ntheir rights so that they may seek\nappropriate remedies when violations\noccur. Failure to post required notices\ndeprives employees of both the\nknowledge of their rights and of the\navailability of avenues of redress.\nAccordingly, a substantial majority of\nthe courts of appeals—including the\nFirst, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,\nSeventh, Eighth, and Eleventh\nCircuits—have adopted the doctrine that\nthe failure to post required employment\nlaw notices may result in equitable\ntolling of the statute of limitations.\nMercado v.

To\nbar an employee who is excusably\nunaware of the NLRA from seeking a\nremedy for a violation of NLRA rights\nbecause he or she failed to file an unfair\nlabor practice charge within the 10(b)\nperiod, when the employer did not post\nthe required notice, would unfairly\ndeprive the employee of the protection\nof the Act because of the employer’s\nfailure to comply with its legal\nresponsibilities. To deny equitable\ntolling in such circumstances ‘‘would\ngrant to the employee a right to be\ninformed without redress for violation.’’\nBonham v. Dresser Industries, above,\n569 F.2d at 193. 149\n147 See comments of Harkin and Miller, AFL–CIO,\nand Service Employees International Union (SEIU).\n148 The Board has broad discretion to interpret\n10(b), including equitable tolling, in accordance\nwith its experience administering the Act.

Cir. 1991)\n(deferring to the Board’s interpretation of 10(b)\nequitable exceptions).\n149 Under the final rule, the Board could also find\nthe failure to post the notice to be an unfair labor\npractice, and could, if appropriate, consider a\nwillful failure to post to be evidence of unlawful\nmotive in an unfair labor practice case. However,\nThe Board received many comments\nopposing this proposed rule provision.\nSeveral comments assert that, when a\ncharging party is unaware of the facts\nsupporting the finding of an unfair labor\npractice, the Board tolls the 10(b) period\nonly when the charged party has\nfraudulently concealed those facts from\nthe charging party. 150 That is not so.\nThe Board has long held, with court\napproval, that the 10(b) period begins to\nrun only when the charging party has\nnotice that the NLRA has been violated.\nThe party asserting the 10(b) defense\nhas the burden to show such notice; it\nmay do so by showing that the charging\nparty had either actual or constructive\nknowledge of the alleged unfair labor\npractice prior to the 10(b) period.

NLRB, 483\nF.2d 628, 634 (9th Cir. 2007); University\nMoving & Storage Co., 350 NLRB 6, 7,\n18 (2007); John Morrell & Co., above,\n304 NLRB at 899; Pullman Building\nCompany, 251 NLRB 1048 (1980), enfd.\n691 F.2d 507 (9th Cir. 1982) (table);\nBurgess Construction, 227 NLRB 765,\n766 (1977), enfd. 596 F.2d 378 (9th Cir.\n1978), cert. denied 440 U.S. 940 (1979).\nKnowledge may be imputed if the\ncharging party would have discovered\nthe unlawful conduct by exercising\nreasonable or due diligence. Broadway\nVolkswagen, above, 342 NLRB at 1246.\nCertainly, the Board has found it\nappropriate to toll the 10(b) period\nwhen the charging party was excusably\nunaware of the pertinent facts because\nthe charged party had fraudulently\nconcealed them; see, e.g., Burgess\nConstruction, above, 227 NLRB at 766;\nbut tolling is not limited to such\ncircumstances. Pullman Building\nCompany, above, 251 NLRB at 1048.\nTo the extent that the comments argue\nthat the Board should not engage in\nequitable tolling of the 10(b) period\nwhen an employer has merely failed to\npost the notice but not engaged in\nfraudulent concealment, 151 the Board\ndisagrees. Fraudulent concealment\nconcerns a different kind of equitable\ndoctrine, and is not directly relevant to\nthe notice posting equitable tolling\ndoctrine hereby adopted. See Mercado,\nabove, 410 F.3d at 46–47 n.8 (employer\nmisconduct and equitable tolling\nin the absence of equitable tolling of the 10(b)\nperiod, such ‘‘redress’’ would not aid an employee\nwho was excusably unaware of his or her NLRA\nrights, failed to file a timely charge, and thus was\ndenied any remedy for violation of those rights. Cf.\nKanakis Co., 293 NLRB 435, 436 fn. 10 (1989)\n(possibility of criminal sanctions against employer\nwould be little comfort to charging party if deprived\nof recourse to Board’s remedial processes).\n150 See, e.g., comments of FMI, COLLE.\n151 See, e.g., comments of FMI, COLLE.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\ndoctrine form ‘‘two distinct lines of\ncases apply[ing] two distinct standards\nto two distinct bases for equitable\ntolling’’).\nSome comments argue that because\nSection 10(b) contains a limited\nexception to the 6-month filing period\nfor employees in the military, it is\nimproper for the Board to toll the 10(b)\nperiod under other circumstances. 152\nThe Board rejects this argument as\nforeclosed by the Supreme Court’s\nholding in Zipes, above, and by the long\nline of Board and court decisions\nfinding tolling of the 10(b) period\nappropriate. In any event, the exception\nin Section 10(b) for persons in the\nmilitary provides that if the aggrieved\nperson ‘‘was prevented from filing such\ncharge by reason of service in the armed\nforces, in which event the six-month\nperiod shall be computed from the day\nof his discharge.’’ This provision does\nnot toll the six-month period during\narmed service; rather, it states that the\nsix-month period begins at discharge.\nSee Holland v. Florida, 130 S.Ct. 2549,\n2561 (2010) (rejecting argument that\nexplicit exceptions to time limits in\nnonjurisdictional statute of limitations\nprecluded equitable tolling). 153\nA number of comments contend that\ntolling the 10(b) period is contrary to the\nsalutary purpose of statutes of\nlimitations in general, and 10(b) in\nparticular, which is ‘‘to require diligent\nprosecution of known claims, thereby\nproviding finality and predictability in\nlegal affairs and ensuring that claims\nwill be resolved while evidence is\nreasonably available and fresh.’’ 154\nBlack’s Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, at\n1546. The Board recognizes that with\nthe passage of time evidence can be lost\nand witnesses die, move away, or their\nmemories fade; it therefore will not\nlightly find that the 10(b) period should\nbe tolled. However, like the courts\nwhose decisions are cited above, the\nBoard also recognizes that equitable\ntolling is a fundamental part of the\nstatute of limitations, and that inequity\nresults from barring an individual from\nseeking relief from a violation of his or\nher NLRA rights where the individual\nexcusably was unaware of these rights.\nAfter all, the purpose of a statute of\nlimitations is to ‘‘require diligent\n152 See, e.g., comments of California Chamber and\nNCAE.\n153 American Bus Association v. Slater, 231 F. 3d\n1 (D.C. Cir. 2000), cited by California Chamber and\nNCAE, did not concern equitable tolling and is\ntherefore inapposite. The court there also found that\nCongress had expressly limited the sanctions\navailable under the Americans with Disabilities Act\nto those enumerated in that statute; such is not the\ncase under the NLRA.\n154 See, e.g., comments of FMI, COLLE, and U.S.\nChamber of Commerce.\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54035\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nprosecution of known claims,’’ not\nclaims that are unknown to the injured\nparty. As to concerns that the statute of\nlimitations could be tolled for years,\n‘‘perhaps indefinitely,’’ 155 the Board\nresponds that such a potential also\nexists under other statutes, as well as\nunder the NLRA when a charging party\nis unaware of the facts giving rise to an\nalleged unfair labor practice. However,\nat this point, concerns about the\nunfairness of lengthy tolling periods are\nentirely speculative. Tolling is an\nequitable matter, and one factor to be\nconsidered in deciding whether\nequitable tolling is appropriate is\nwhether it would prejudice the\nrespondent. Mercado, above, 410 F.3d at\n48. Accordingly, if a lengthy tolling of\nthe 10(b) period would prejudice an\nemployer in a given case, the Board\ncould properly consider that factor in\ndetermining whether tolling was\nappropriate in that case. 156\nSeveral comments argue against\ntolling the 10(b) period because\n‘‘ignorance of the law is no excuse.’’ 157\nThis argument is amply refuted by the\ncourt decisions cited above, in which\nlimitations periods under other\nworkplace statutes were tolled because\nemployers failed to post required\nnotices. Most notably, the Fifth Circuit\nhas emphasized that the failure to post\na required notice ‘‘vitiates the normal\nassumption that an employee is aware\nof his rights.’’ Elliot v. Group Med. &\nSurgical Serv., 714 F.2d 556, 563–64\n(5th Cir. 1983). In any event, the maxim\nrelied on is generally understood to\nhave arisen in order to prevent\nindividuals (usually in criminal cases)\nfrom deliberately failing to ascertain\nwhether actions they contemplate taking\nwould be lawful, and then pleading\nignorance when accused of\nlawbreaking. 158 In the Board’s view, this\nreasoning loses much of its force when\napplied to individuals, such as charging\nparties in unfair labor practice cases,\nwho are not accused of any wrongdoing\nbut who claim to have been injured by\nthe unlawful actions of other parties.\nThe Board emphasizes, however, that\nfailure to post the required notice will\nnot automatically warrant a tolling\nremedy. If an employer proves that an\n155 See comments of Fisher & Phillips LLC and\nNational Grocers Association.\n156 As to ACC’s concern that the rule could\npotentially subject employers to unfair labor\npractice charges based on conduct as far back as\n1935, the Board stresses that tolling will be\navailable only in the case of unlawful conduct that\noccurs after the rule takes effect.\n157 See, e.g., comments of Coalition for a\nDemocratic Workplace and COLLE.\n158 Moreover, even in criminal law, the principle\nis not absolute. See, e.g., Lambert v. California, 355\nU.S. 225 (1957).\nemployee had actual or constructive\nknowledge of the conduct alleged to be\nunlawful, as well as actual or\nconstructive knowledge that the\nconduct violated the NLRA, and yet\nfailed to timely file an unfair labor\npractice charge, the Board will not toll\nthe 10(b) period merely because of the\nemployer’s failure to post the notice. Cf.\nJohn Morrell & Co., above, 304 NLRB at\n899.\nThe Board asked for comments\nconcerning whether unions filing unfair\nlabor practice charges should be deemed\nto have constructive knowledge of the\nunlawful character of the conduct at\nissue. All of the comments that\naddressed this issue answered in the\naffirmative. 159 Unlike most employees,\nunions routinely deal with issues\narising under the NLRA and are\ntherefore more familiar with the Act’s\nprovisions. Accordingly, the tolling\nprovisions in the final rule apply only\nto charges filed by employees, not those\nfiled by unions. (The Board still could\ntoll the 10(b) period if a charging party\nunion did not discover the facts\nunderlying the charge within six\nmonths, if the employees reporting\nthose events failed to alert the union\nwithin that time because they were\nexcusably unaware of their NLRA\nrights.)\nSeveral comments contend that\nfailure to post the required notice\nshould not toll the 10(b) period if an\nemployee who files an unfair labor\npractice charge is either a union\nmember or is represented by a union.\nTaft Stettinius & Hollister LLP asserts\nthat the burden should be placed\nequally on unions to ensure that their\norganizers and members are aware of\nemployee rights under the NLRA.\nCalifornia Chamber and NCAE observe\nthat knowledge of a filing time limit is\ngenerally imputed to an individual who\nis represented by an attorney, see, e.g.,\nMercado v. Ritz-Carlton San Juan Hotel,\nabove, 410 F.3d at 47–48; they urge that\nan employee who is represented by a\nunion should be treated similarly.\nConversely, three Georgetown\nUniversity law students oppose the idea\nthat union-represented employees\nshould be deemed to have constructive\nknowledge of NLRA rights. They reason\nthat some workplaces may have\nunrepresented as well as represented\nemployees, and that imputing\nknowledge to the latter group would\nprovide an incentive not to post the\nnotice, thus depriving the former group\nof needed information. The students\n159 See, e.g., comments of U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce, American Trucking Associations, Taft\nStettinius & Hollister LLP.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nalso suggest that some employees,\nthough represented, may have little\ncontact with their unions and rely on\nworkplace notices instead of unions for\nrelevant information.\nThe Board finds some merit in both\nsets of contentions. On the one hand, it\nis reasonable to assume that employees\nwho are represented by unions are more\nlikely to be aware of their NLRA rights\nthan unrepresented employees. And,\nalthough being represented by a union\nis not the same as being represented by\nlegal counsel, it is reasonable to assume\nthat union officials are sufficiently\nconversant with the NLRA to be able to\ngive employees effective advice as to\ntheir NLRA rights. On the other hand,\nsome employees, though represented by\nunions, may in fact have little contact\nwith their bargaining representatives for\none reason or other and may, in fact, be\nfiling charges against their\nrepresentative. Thus, the Board does not\nfind it appropriate under all\ncircumstances to impute knowledge of\nNLRA rights to charge-filing employees\nwho are union members or are\nrepresented by unions. Rather, the\nBoard will consider evidence\nconcerning the union’s representational\npresence and activity in determining\nwhether it is appropriate to toll the\n10(b) period.\nC. Failure To Post as Evidence of\nUnlawful Motive\nThe Board suggested that it could\nconsider an employer’s knowing failure\nto post the notice as evidence of\nunlawful motive in an unfair labor\npractice proceeding in which motive is\nan issue. 75 FR 80414–80415. A number\nof comments assert that the Board\ncannot properly take that step. 160 To the\ncontrary, the Board has often considered\nother unlawful conduct as evidence of\nantiunion animus in cases in which\nunlawful motive was an element of an\nunfair labor practice. 161 See, e.g., Leiser\nConstruction, LLC, 349 NLRB 413, 417–\n419 (2007) (threats, coercive statements,\ninterrogations evidence of unlawfully\nmotivated failure to hire), enfd. 281 Fed.\nAppx. 781 (10th Cir. 2008)\n(unpublished); Shearer’s Foods, 340\nNLRB 1093, 1094 (2003) (plant closing\nthreat evidence of unlawfully motivated\ndischarge); Ferguson-Williams, Inc., 322\nNLRB 695, 703, 707 (1996) (threats,\ninterrogations, creation of impression of\nsurveillance, evidence of unlawfully\nmotivated discharge); Champion Rivet\nCo., 314 NLRB 1097, 1098 (1994)\n(circulating unlawful antiunion petition,\n160 See, e.g., comments of COLLE and California\nChamber.\n161 See comment of AFL–CIO.\n54036 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nrefusal to recognize and bargain with\nunion, evidence of unlawfully\nmotivated failure to hire). Thus, it is\nproper for the Board to consider a\nknowing and willful failure to post the\nnotice as evidence of unlawful motive.\nHowever, the Board has noticed that\nit employed somewhat inconsistent\nlanguage in the NPRM regarding the\nconsideration of failure to post the\nnotice as evidence of antiunion animus.\nThus, the caption of paragraph\n104.214(b) reads: ‘‘Knowing\nnoncompliance as evidence of unlawful\nmotive.’’ However, the paragraph itself\nstates that ‘‘If an employer has actual or\nconstructive knowledge of the\nrequirement to post the notice and fails\nor refuses to do so, the Board may\nconsider such a willful refusal as\nevidence of unlawful motive in a case\nin which motive is an issue.’’ (Emphasis\nadded in both cases.) 75 FR at 80420. In\nthe preamble to the NPRM, the Board\nreferred only to knowing noncompliance\nas evidence of unlawful motive. 75 FR\nat 80414–80415. On reflection, the\nBoard wishes to clarify this provision to\nstate that, to be considered as evidence\nof unlawful motive, an employer’s\nfailure to post the notice must be both\nknowing and willful—i.e., the employer\nmust have actual (as opposed to\nconstructive) knowledge of the rule and\nyet refuse, on no cognizable basis, to\npost the notice. The Board is revising\nthe language of the rule accordingly.\nThe comment that prompted these\nrevisions urges that there should be no\nadverse consequences for the employer\nthat does not post the notice because it\nhas a good-faith (but, implicitly,\nerroneous) belief that it is not covered\nby the NLRA. 162 The Board rejects this\ncontention as it pertains to finding the\nfailure to post to be an unfair labor\npractice or grounds for tolling the 10(b)\nperiod. Failure to post the notice\ninterferes with employees’ NLRA rights\nregardless of the reason for the failure;\ngood faith, though commendable, is\nirrelevant. 163 Additionally, tolling is\n162 One example could be an employer that\nbelieves that it is subject to the Railway Labor Act\nand not to the NLRA.\n163 This is so in other areas of NLRA law. For\nexample, an employer who coercively interrogates\nor disciplines an individual concerning his or her\nunion activities violates the NLRA if the individual\nis a statutory employee, even though the employer\nmay have honestly believed that the individual was\na statutory supervisor and not protected by the\nNLRA. Also, absent compelling economic\ncircumstances, an employer that is testing the\nBoard’s certification of a newly-selected union in\nthe court of appeals makes unilateral changes in\nunit employees’ terms and conditions of\nemployment at its peril; if the court affirms the\ncertification, the unilateral changes violate NLRA\nSection 8(a)(5) even if the employer believed in\ngood faith that the certification was inappropriate.\nconcerned with fairness to the\nemployee, and these fairness concerns\nare unaffected by the employer’s good or\nbad faith; as previously noted, notice\nposting tolling is fundamentally\ndifferent from tolling based upon\nemployer misconduct. However, an\nemployer that fails to post the notice\nonly because it honestly but erroneously\nbelieves that it is not subject to the\nNLRB’s jurisdiction does not thereby\nindicate that it is hostile to employees’\nNLRA rights, but only that it believes\nthat those rights do not apply in the\nemployer’s workplace. In such a case,\nthe employer’s good faith normally\nshould preclude finding the failure to\npost to be willful or evidence of\nantiunion animus.\nACC contends that even though the\nrule states that only a ‘‘willful’’ failure\nto post the notice may be considered\nevidence of unlawful motive, in practice\nthe Board will always infer at least\nconstructive notice from the publication\nof the rule in the Federal Register and\nthe maxim that ‘‘ignorance of the law is\nno excuse.’’ 164 The Board rejects this\ncontention. The quoted maxim means\nonly that an employer’s actual lack of\nknowledge of the rule would not excuse\nits failure to post the notice. It would,\nhowever, undercut any suggestion that\nthe failure to post was willful and\ntherefore indicative of unlawful motive.\nContrary to numerous comments, 165\nfinding a willful failure to post the\nnotice as evidence of animus is not the\nsame as adopting a ‘‘presumption of\nanimus’’ or ‘‘presumption of unlawful\nmotive.’’ There is no such presumption.\nThe Board’s general counsel would have\nthe burden of proving that a failure to\npost was willful. In any event, a willful\nfailure to post would not be conclusive\nproof of unlawful motive, but merely\nevidence that could be considered,\nalong with other evidence, in\ndetermining whether the general\ncounsel had demonstrated unlawful\nmotive. 166 Likewise, contrary to the\ncontentions of ALFA and AHCA, the\nBoard will not assume that any failure\nMike O’Connor Chevrolet, 209 NLRB 701, 703\n(1974), enf. denied on other grounds 512 F.2d 684\n(8th Cir. 1975).\n164 See also comment of American Health Care\nAssociation (AHCA).\n165 See, e.g., comments of FMI and COLLE.\n166 The Georgetown law students ask whether, if\nfailure to post the notice may be found to be an\nunfair labor practice and also may be considered\nevidence of antiunion animus, such a failure could\n‘‘satisfy an element of its own violation.’’ The\nanswer is no, because the failure to post, whether\nknowing or inadvertent, would be an unfair labor\npractice regardless of motive; knowing and willful\nfailure to post would be relevant only in cases such\nas those alleging unlawful discipline, discharge, or\nrefusal to hire, in which motive is an element of the\nviolation.\nto post the notice is intentional and\nmeant to prevent employees of learning\ntheir rights.\nD. Other Comments\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nThe Board received many comments\nasserting that if the proposed\nenforcement scheme for failure to post\nthe required notice is adopted, union\nadherents will tear down the notices in\norder to harass employers and,\nparticularly, to vitiate 10(b). 167 These\ncomments express the concern that\ntolling the 10(b) period will lead to a\nflood of unfair labor practice charges,\nand that, to avoid that eventuality,\nemployers will have to incur significant\ncosts of policing the postings and/or\ninstalling expensive tamper-proof\nbulletin boards. 168 In the absence of\nexperience with such postings, the\nBoard deems these concerns speculative\nat this time. If particular employers\nexperience such difficulties, the Board\nwill deal with them on a case-by-case\nbasis. However, as explained above,\ntolling is an equitable matter, and if an\nemployer has posted the notice and\ntaken reasonable steps to insure that it\nremains posted, it is unlikely that the\nBoard would find tolling appropriate.\nCalifornia Chamber and NCAE ask the\nBoard to specify the ‘‘additional\nremedies’’ that may be imposed in the\nevent of a notice posting violation.\n104.213(a). The Board has broad\ndiscretion in crafting remedies for\nviolations of the NLRA. NLRB v. Seven-\nUp Bottling Co. of Miami, 344 U.S. 344,\n346 (1953). The remedies imposed in a\ngiven case depend on the nature of the\nviolations and the particular facts in the\ncase. The Board declines to speculate as\nto every possible remedy that might be\nimposed in every imaginable set of\ncircumstances.\nSeveral comments protest that\nemployers could be fined for failing to\npost the notice; several others contend\nthat the Board should levy fines instead\nof imposing the proposed remedies. The\n167 See, e.g., comments of Lemon Grove Care &\nRehabilitation, numerous ‘‘postcard’’ comments.\n168 One comment asserts that because of the\npotential for tolling the 10(b) period, ‘‘businesses\n* * * will have to keep records forever[.]’’ The\nBoard finds no merit in this contention. Employers\nthat are aware of the rule can avoid keeping records\n‘‘forever’’ simply by posting the notice. Employers\nthat are not aware of the requirement to post the\nnotice would also be unaware of the possibility of\ntolling the 10(b) period in the event of a failure to\npost, and thus would discern no reason to—and\nprobably would not—keep records ‘‘forever.’’\nPrejudice to the employer because of long-lost\nrecords would be considered by the Board in\ndetermining whether tolling is appropriate in the\nparticular case.\nAnother comment complains that ‘‘the\nrequirement of proof on the employer to ‘certify’\nthat this posting is up each day is burdensome[.]’’\nThere is no such requirement.\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54037\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nBoard rejects both contentions because,\nas explained in the NPRM, the Board\ndoes not have the authority to impose\nfines. 75 FR 80414, citing Republic Steel\nCorp. v. NLRB, 311 U.S. 7, 10–12 (1940).\nAnother comment argues that the Board\nshould not provide remedies for failing\nto post the notice because such\nremedies are not provided under other\nstatutes. In fact, both remedies and\nsanctions are imposed under some\nstatutes; see, e.g., 29 CFR 1601.30 (fine\nof $110 per offense for failing to post\nnotice under Title VII); 29 CFR\n825.300(a)(1) (same sanction for failing\nto post notice under FMLA); cases cited\nabove for tolling of limitation periods\nfor failing to post notices under several\nstatutes.\nOne comment contends that the\nproposed remedies were proposed\nsolely as means of deterring failures to\npost the notices, and are therefore\ninappropriate; several other comments\nassert that the proposed remedies are\npunitive. 169 Although the Board\ndisagrees, there is language in the\nNPRM that may have inadvertently\nsuggested that the enforcement\nmechanisms were proposed solely for\ndeterrent purposes. The Board wishes to\ncorrect any such misimpression. As\nstated above, in explaining why it was\nproposing those mechanisms, the Board\nstated in its NPRM that it was ‘‘mindful\nof the need to identify effective\nincentives for compliance.’’ 75 FR\n80413. Later, referring to tolling the\n10(b) period and considering a willful\nfailure to post the notice as evidence of\nunlawful motive, the Board said that it\n‘‘proposes the following options\nintended to induce compliance with the\nnotice-posting requirement.’’ Id. at\n80414. However, the Board made those\nstatements while explaining why it had\ndetermined not to rely entirely on\nemployers’ voluntary compliance with\nthe rule. (The Board had had little\nsuccess in persuading employers to\nvoluntarily post notices of employee\nrights during the critical period leading\nup to a representation election.) Id. By\nnoting that the proposed enforcement\nscheme would have some deterrent\neffect in that context, the Board did not\nmean to imply that it was proposing\nthose measures solely for deterrence\npurposes. For the reasons discussed at\nlength above, the Board has found that\nfinding a failure to post the notices to\nviolate Section 8(a)(1) and, in\nappropriate circumstances, to warrant\ntolling the 10(b) period and/or inferring\nunlawful motive in an unfair labor\npractice case are legitimate remedial\n169 See, e.g., comments of FMI, ALFA, AHCA.\nmeasures supported by extensive Board\nand court precedent.\nIn addition, in a number of places the\nNPRM used the term ‘‘sanctions’’ in a\nvery loose sense to refer to aspects of the\nproposed enforcement scheme,\ninadvertently suggesting that this\nscheme was punitive. The term\n‘‘sanctions’’ was an inapt choice of\ndescriptor for the enforcement scheme:\nthe classic 8(a)(1) remedial order has\nlong been upheld as nonpunitive;\nequitable tolling is concerned with\nfairness to employees, not punishment\nof misconduct, and is fully consistent\nwith current Board doctrine; and the\nanimus provision is little more than the\ncommon-sense extension of wellestablished\nevidentiary principles that\napply to many other NLRA violations,\nand is also not designed to punish\nemployers. That they may also furnish\nincentives for employers to comply with\nthe notice-posting rule does not detract\nfrom their legitimacy; if it were\notherwise, the Board could never\nimpose any remedy for violations of the\nNLRA if the remedy had a deterrent\neffect. In any event, the Board hereby\ndisavows any suggestion from\nstatements in the NPRM that the\nremedial measures were proposed solely\nas penalties.\nContrary to the tenor of numerous\ncomments opposing this rule, 170 the\nBoard is not issuing the rule in order to\nentrap unwary employers and make\noperations more difficult for them\nbecause of inadvertent or technical\nviolations. It is doing so in order that\nemployees may come to understand\ntheir NLRA rights through exposure to\nnotices posted in their workplaces\nexplaining those rights. Accordingly,\nthe important thing is that the notices be\nposted. As explained above, an\nemployer that fails to post the notice\nbecause it is unaware of the rule, but\npromptly posts the notice when the rule\nis brought to its attention, will nearly\nalways avoid any further proceedings.\nSimilarly, an employer that posts the\nnotice but fails initially to comply with\none of the technical posting\nrequirements will almost always avoid\nfurther problems by correcting the error\nwhen it is called to the employer’s\nattention. And if an employer is unsure\nof what the rule requires in a particular\nsetting, it can seek and receive guidance\nfrom the Board.\nThe Service Employees International\nUnion and the United Food and\nCommercial Workers propose that, in\n170 For example, ‘‘This seems to be yet another\ntrap for the employers. Another avenue to subject\nthem to law suits and interrogations, and\nuneconomic activities and ungodly expenditures.’’\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\naddition to the proposed enforcement\nscheme, the rule state that an\nemployer’s knowing failure to post the\nnotice of employee rights during the\ncritical period before a representation\nelection shall be grounds for setting the\nelection aside on the filing of proper\nobjections. The Board finds that this is\nunnecessary, because the Board’s notice\nof election, which must be posted by an\nemployer three working days before an\nelection takes place, contains a\nsummary of employee NLRA rights and\na list of several kinds of unfair labor\npractices, and failure to post that notice\nalready constitutes grounds for setting\nan election aside. 171 In any event,\nduring a union organizing campaign, the\nunion can instruct members of its inplant\norganizing committee to verify\nwhether the notice required under this\nrule has been posted; if it has not, the\nunion can so inform the employer and,\nif need be, the Board’s regional office.\nSubpart C—Ancillary Matters\nSeveral technical issues unrelated to\nthose discussed in the two previous\nsubparts are set out in this subpart.\nIV.

They impose\non as many as six million private\nemployers the obligation to post a notice\nof employee rights and selected\nillustrative unfair labor practices. The\nobligation to post is deemed enforceable\nthrough Section 8(a)(1)’s proscription of\ninterference with employees’ Section 7\nrights, and the failure to post is further\npenalized by equitable tolling of Section\n10(b)’s limitations period and the\npossible inference of discriminatory\nmotivation for adverse employment\nactions taken in the absence of posting.\nWhile the need for a more informed\nconstituency might be a desirable goal,\nit is attainable only with Congressional\nimprimatur. The Board’s rulemaking\nauthority, broad as it is, does not\nencompass the authority to promulgate\na rule of this kind. Even if it did, the\naction taken here is arbitrary and\ncapricious, and therefore invalid,\nbecause it is not based on substantial\nevidence and it lacks a reasoned\nanalysis.\n171 See Section 103.20 of the Board’s Rules and\nRegulations.\n172 Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 291\n(2001).\n54038 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nNo Statutory Authority for the Proposed\nRule\nThe majority concedes that the\n‘‘National Labor Relations Act does not\ndirectly address an employer’s\nobligation to post a notice of its\nemployees’ rights arising under the Act\nor the consequences an employer may\nface for failing to do so.’’ In fact, the\nNLRA 173 makes no mention of any such\nputative obligation. The majority further\nacknowledges that the NLRA ‘‘is almost\nunique among major Federal labor laws\nin not including an express statutory\nprovision requiring employers routinely\nto post notices at their workplaces\ninforming employees of their statutory\nrights.’’ Despite the obvious import of\nthese admissions, the majority\nconcludes that the Board’s plenary\nauthority under Section 6 of the Act to\nmake rules ‘‘necessary to carry out the\nprovisions of the Act’’ permits\npromulgation of the rule they advocate.\nI disagree.\nCongress did not give specific\nstatutory authority to the Board to\nrequire the posting of a general rights\nnotice when it passed the Wagner Act\nin 1935. Just one year earlier, however,\nCongress amended the Railway Labor\nAct (‘‘RLA’’) to include an express\nnotice-posting requirement. 45 U.S.C.\n152 Eighth; Pub. L. No. 73–442, 48 Stat.\n1185, 1188 (1934). As the Supreme\nCourt noted, the RLA served as the\nmodel for the National Labor Relations\nAct. NLRB v. Pennsylvania Greyhound\nLines, 303 U.S. 261 (1938). See also\nNLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,\n301 U.S. 1, 44 (1937); H. J. Heinz Co. v.\nNLRB, 311 U.S. 514, 524–525(1941).\nThat Congress did not include an\nexpress notice-posting requirement\nwhen passing the Wagner Act the\nfollowing year strongly implies, if not\ncompels, the conclusion that Congress\ndid not intend for the Board to have\nregulatory authority to require such a\nnotice. Nothing in the legislative history\nhints of any concern by Congress about\nthe need for employers to notify\nemployees generally of their rights\nunder the new enacting statute. Since\n1935, despite extensive revisions in the\nTaft-Hartley Act amendments of 1947\nand the Landrum-Griffin Act\namendments of 1959, Congress has\nnever added such authority.\nOn the other hand, when Congress\nhas subsequently desired to include a\ngeneral rights notice-posting\nrequirement, it has done so expressly in\nother federal labor and employment\n173 Throughout this dissent, I will refer generally\nto the statute we administer as the NLRA, unless\nthe discussion focuses on a specific historical\nversion, such as the Wagner Act.\nlaws. See Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C.\n2000e–10, the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. 627,\nThe Occupational Safety and Health\nAct, 29 U.S.C. 657(c), the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.\n12115, the Family and Medical Leave\nAct (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. 2619(a), and the\nUniformed Service Employment and\nReemployment Rights Act (USERRA),\n38 U.S.C. 4334(a).\nThe majority points out that the\nDepartment of Labor (DOL) promulgated\na notice-posting rule under the Fair\nLabor Standards Act (FLSA), although\nthat statute does not contain a specific\nstatutory provision on workplace\npostings. However, the FLSA, unlike the\nNLRA, imposes a data-collection and\nrecordkeeping requirement on\nemployers. 29 U.S.C. 211(c). DOL’s\nWage and Hour Administrator\npromulgated the notice-posting\nregulation in 1949 in reliance on this\nrequirement. It appears that the\npropriety of the FLSA rule has never\nbeen challenged, perhaps because,\nunlike the rule promulgated herein,\nthere are no citations or penalties\nassessed for the failure to post. This is\na significant point of distinction that\nwarrants further discussion.\nIt must be constantly borne in mind\nthat the rule promulgated today makes\nthe failure to post the required notice a\nviolation of the Act. The majority\nmisleadingly seeks to decouple\nobligation from violation in its analysis\nby discussing the latter in the context of\nenforcement of the assertedly lawful\nnotice-posting rule. That is nonsense.\nMaking noncompliance an unfair labor\npractice is integral to the rule and,\nconsequently, integral to an analysis of\nwhether the notice-posting requirement\nis a permissible exercise of the Board’s\nrulemaking authority. Of the\naforementioned agencies that have\nnotice-posting requirements, none of\nthem makes the failure to post unlawful,\nabsent additional specific statutory\nauthorization. Only the RLA, Title VII,\nFMLA, and the Occupational Safety Act\n(OSHA) have such authorizing language.\nADA, the ADEA, the FLSA, and the\nUSERRA do not. Consequently, an\nemployer’s failure to post a notice under\nthose statutes is not subject to sanction\nas unlawful.\nThus, both before and after the\nWagner Act, Congress has consistently\nmanifested by express statutory\nlanguage its intent to impose a general\nnotice-posting duty on employers with\nrespect to the rights of employees under\nvarious federal labor laws. Only one\nadministrative agency promulgated a\nnotice-posting requirement in the\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nabsence of such language in its enabling\nstatute. No agency has made the failure\nto comply with a notice-posting\nrequirement unlawful absent express\nstatutory authorization, until today.\nThe explicit inclusion of noticeposting\nprovisions and permissible\nsanctions by Congress in other labor\nlegislation undercuts the majority’s\nclaim that this notice-posting rule is not\na ‘‘major policy decision properly made\nby Congress alone.’’ Strangely, the\nmajority does not merely contend that\nthis pattern in comparable labor\nlegislation fails to prove that Congress\ndid not intend that the Board should\nhave the rulemaking authority under\nSection 6 to mandate the notice posting\nat issue here. They conversely contend\nthat it proves Congress must have\nintended to confer such authority on the\nBoard! 174\nPerhaps cognizant of the weakness of\nthis position, the majority attempts to\ndownplay the import of Congressional\nsilence on the Board’s authority to\nmandate notice posting and to enforce\nthat mandate through unfair labor\npractice sanctions. They cite Cheney\nR.R. Co. v. ICC, 902 F. 2d 66, 68–69\n(D.C. Cir. 1990), for the proposition that\nthe maxim ‘‘expressio unius est exclusio\nalterius,’’ which holds that the special\nmention of one thing indicates an intent\nfor another thing not be included\nelsewhere, may not always be a useful\ntool for interpreting the intent of\nCongress. Obviously, the usefulness of\nthis tool depends on the context of a\nparticular statute. Independent Ins.\nAgents of Am., Inc. v. Hawke, 211 F.3d\n638 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (applying the\nmaxim). In my view, the absence of an\nexpress notice provision in the NLRA,\nand the failure to amend the Act to\ninclude one when Congress expressly\nincluded notice posting provisions in\nother labor statutes, shows that it did\nnot intend to authorize the Board to\npromulgate this rule. 175\nArguing to the contrary, the majority\nasserts that the notice-posting rule is\n174 Of course, this reasoning would seem to\ndictate that the failure of the Board to inform its\nown employees of their general rights under the\nFederal Labor Relations Act is an unfair labor\npractice, even though that statute imposes no such\nexpress requirement. To date, I am not aware that\nthis agency, or any other, views itself as subject to\nsuch an enforceable obligation.\n175 The majority contends that the fact that the\nrule comes 76 years after the NLRA was enacted is\nnot a ‘‘condition of validity.’’ Mayo Foundation for\nMedical Education and Research v. United States,\n131 S.Ct. 704, 713–14 (2011) (quoting Smiley v.\nCitibank (S.D.), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 740 (1996)\n(‘‘neither antiquity nor contemporaneity with the\nstatute is a condition of validity.’’). I have no\nproblem with that proposition, but if the Board\nlacks statutory authority to promulgate a rule, it is\nof no matter that it attempts to do so in year 1 or\nyear 76 of its existence.\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54039\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nentitled to deference under the analysis\nset forth in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Under\nChevron, where Congress has not\n‘‘directly addressed the precise question\nat issue,’’ id. at 842–843, that\nrulemaking authority may be used in\norder ‘‘to fill any gap left, implicitly or\nexplicitly, by Congress.’’ Id. at 843.\nEven assuming that the absence of an\nexplicit posting requirement in the\nNLRA is not interpreted as clear\nexpression of Congressional intent, the\nmajority fails to persuade that Congress\ndelegated authority in Section 6 of the\nNLRA for the Board to fill a putative\nstatutory gap by promulgating a rule\nthat an employer commits an unfair\nlabor practice by failing to affirmative\nnotify its employees of their rights\nunder the NLRA. As the Supreme Court\nhas explained, ‘‘the ultimate question is\nwhether Congress would have intended,\nand expected, courts to treat [the\nregulation] as within, or outside, its\ndelegation to the agency of ‘gap-filling’\nauthority.’’ Long Island Care at Home,\nLtd. v. Coke, 551 U.S. 158, 173 (2007).\nThere is no doubt that there are many\ngaps and ambiguities in the NLRA that\nCongress intended for the Board to\naddress, using its labor expertise, either\nthrough adjudication or rulemaking.\nHowever, the existence of ambiguity in\na statute is not enough per se to warrant\ndeference to the agency’s interpretation\nof its authority in every respect. The\nambiguity must be such as to make it\nappear that Congress either explicitly or\nimplicitly delegated authority to cure\nthat ambiguity. Am. Bar Ass’n v. FTC,\n430 F.3d 457, 469 (D.C. Cir. 2005);\nMotion Picture Ass’n of America, Inc. v.\nFCC, 309 F. 3d 796, 801 (D.C. Cir. 2002)\n(‘‘MPAA ’’) (‘‘agency’s interpretation of\n[a] statute is not entitled to deference\nabsent a delegation of authority from\nCongress to regulate in the areas at\nissue.’’).\nThus, even when an administrative\nagency seeks to address what it believes\nis a serious interpretive problem, the\nSupreme Court has said that the agency\n‘‘may not exercise its authority ‘in a\nmanner that is inconsistent with the\nadministrative structure that Congress\nenacted into law.’ ’’ FDA v. Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S.\n120, 125(2000) (quoting ETSI Pipeline\nProject v. Missouri, 484 U.S. 495,\n517(1988)). Further, the statute at issue\nmust be considered as a ‘‘symmetrical\nand coherent regulatory scheme.’’\nGustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561,\n569, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1\n(1995). In our case, the exercise of\nrulemaking authority under Section 6 is\nnot self-effectuating; it must be shown\nto relate reasonably to some other\nprovision as part of the overall statutory\nscheme contemplated by Congress. 176\nNothing in the text or the regulatory\nstructure of the NLRA suggests that the\nBoard has the authority to promulgate\nthe notice-posting rule at issue in order\nto address a gap in the statutory scheme\nfor resolving questions concerning\nrepresentation through Section 9, or in\npreventing, through Sections 8 and 10,\nspecifically enumerated unfair labor\npractices that adversely affect\nemployees’ Section 7 rights. On the\ncontrary, it is well-established that the\nBoard lacks independent authority to\ninitiate or to solicit the initiation of\nrepresentation and unfair labor practice\nproceedings, and Section 10(a) limits\nthe Board’s powers to preventing only\nthe unfair labor practices listed in\nSection 8 of the Act. Yet the majority\nasserts that it may exceed these\nlimitations by requiring employers to\npost a notice of employee rights and\nillustrative unfair labor practices at all\ntimes, regardless of whether a petition\nhad been filed or an employer has been\nfound to have committed an unfair labor\npractice.\nThe majority’s reliance on a\ncombination of Section 7, 8, and 10\nwarrants special mention. They reason\nthat an employer interferes with Section\n7 rights in general, and thereby violates\nSection 8(a)(1), by failing to give\ncontinuous notice to employees of those\nrights. It may be a truism that an\nemployee must be aware of his rights in\norder to exercise them, but it does not\nfollow that it is the employer under our\nstatutory scheme who must provide\nenlightenment or else incur liability for\nviolating those rights. The new unfair\nlabor practice created by the rule bears\nno reasonable relation to any unfair\nlabor practice in the NLRA’s preexisting\nenforcement scheme developed\nover seven decades. 177 It certainly bears\n176 See, e.g., Mourning v.

In sustaining the regulation, the Court\nfound the regulation to be within the Federal\nReserve’s rulemaking authority and, in light of the\nlegislative history, the disclosure requirement was\nnot contrary to the statute. ‘‘The crucial distinction,\n* * * [was that] the disclosure requirement was in\nfact enforced through the statute’s pre-existing\nremedial scheme and in a manner consistent with\nit.’’ Ragsdale v.

However, the\nfailure to give such a notice is not per\nse unlawful. It becomes an unfair labor\npractice only when a union, without\ngiving notice, takes the affirmative\naction of seeking to obligate an\nemployee to pay fees and dues under a\nunion-security clause. 180 Beyond that, a\nunion has no general obligation to give\nemployees notice of their Beck and\nGeneral Motors rights; much less does it\nviolate the NLRA by failing to do so. By\ncontrast, the rule promulgated today\nimposes a continuing obligation on\nemployers to post notice of employees’\ngeneral rights and, even absent any\naffirmative act involving those rights,\nmakes the failure to maintain such\nnotice unlawful. 181\nUnlike my colleagues, I find that the\nSupreme Court’s opinion in Local 357,\nTeamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 (1961),\nspeaks directly to this point. In that\ncase, the Board found a hiring hall\nagreement unlawfully discriminatory\nper se because, even though it included\nan express anti-discrimination\npractice ‘‘listed in Section 8.’’ Thus, ‘‘[n]either the\nNational Labor Relations Board nor the courts are\ngiven any blanket authority to prohibit whatever\nlabor practices that in their judgment are deemed\nto be unfair.’’ S. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.\n17 (1935) at 8–9 reprinted in Legislative History of\nthe National Labor Relations Act of 1935, Vol. II at\n2307–2308 (1985).\n178 Communications Workers v.

General Motors, 373 U.S. 734 (1963).\n180 California Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224,\n233 (1995).\n181 None of the FMLA cases cited by the majority\nsupport finding that a failure to post a general\nnotice of employee rights under the NLRA is\nunlawful. In Bachelder, the Ninth Circuit actually\nfound ‘‘unavailing’’ the employer’s argument that it\nhad satisfied all its specific FMLA notice\nobligations because it had complied with the\nFMLA’s general posting rule. Id. at 1127, fn. 5.\nRather, the court found that because the employer\nfailed to ‘‘notify’’ an employee which of the four\nFMLA’s ‘‘leave year’’ calculation methods it had\nchosen, the employer ‘‘interfered’’ with that\nemployee’s rights and, therefore, improperly used\nthe employee’s FMLA covered absences as a\n‘‘negative factor’’ when taking the affirmative\nadverse action of discharging her.\nSimilarly, in neither Greenwell v. Charles\nMachine Works, Inc., 2011 WL 1458565 (W.D.Okla.,\n2011); Smith v. Westchester County, 769 F. Supp 2d\n448 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), was the FMLA general posting\nrequirement at issue. Smith did not involve a notice\nissue and Greenwell involved the employer’s failure\nto comply with a different notification obligation\nunder the FMLA.\nIn any event, as previously stated, FMLA\nexpressly provides that employers give notice to\nemployees of rights thereunder and expressly\nprovides for sanctions if notice is not given. The\nNLRA does neither.\n54040 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nprovision, it did not include two\nadditional provisions that the Board\ndeclared were necessary to prevent\n‘‘unlawful encouragement of union\nmembership.’’ The Court disagreed,\nstating\nPerhaps the conditions which the Board\nattaches to hiring-hall arrangements will in\ntime appeal to the Congress. Yet, where\nCongress has adopted a selective system for\ndealing with evils, the Board is confined to\nthat system. National Labor Relations Board\nv.

Where, as here, Congress has aimed its\nsanctions only at specific discriminatory\npractices, the Board cannot go farther and\nestablish a broader, more pervasive\nregulatory scheme. 182\nCongress in Section 8(a)(1) aimed its\nsanctions only at employer actions that\ninterfere with the exercise of Section 7\nrights. By this rulemaking, my\ncolleagues go farther and establish a\nbroader, more pervasive regulatory\nscheme that targets employer inaction,\nor silence, as unlawful interference. As\nLocal 357 instructs, they lack the\nauthority to do this. 183\nAmerican Hospital Association v.\nNLRB, 499 U.S. 606 (1991) (AHA), upon\nwhich the majority heavily relies,\nillustrates a valid exercise of authority\nunder Section 6. In AHA, the Supreme\nCourt unanimously upheld the Board’s\nhealth care unit rule, finding that\nSection 6’s general grant of rulemaking\nauthority ‘‘was unquestionably\nsufficient to authorize the rule at issue\nin this case unless limited by some\nother provision in the Act.’’ Id. at 609–\n10 (emphasis added). The Court further\nfound that the rule was clearly\nconsistent with authority under Section\n9(b) to make appropriate bargaining unit\ndeterminations. It specifically rejected\nthe argument that language in 9(b)\ndirecting the Board to decide the\nappropriate bargaining unit ‘‘in each\ncase’’ limited its authority to define\nappropriate units by rulemaking.\nCongress expressly authorized the\nBoard in Section 9(b) to determine\nappropriate bargaining units and the\nBoard exercised its rulemaking\nauthority to promulgate a rule\n‘‘necessary to carry out’’ Section 9(b). In\ncontrast, as previously stated, there is\nno reasonable basis for finding that a\nrule making it unlawful for employers to\nfail to post and maintain a notice of\nemployee rights and selected illustrative\n182 365 U.S. at 676.\n183 My colleagues attempt to distinguish Local\n357 as limited to an interpretation of Sec. 8(a)(3)\nand 8(b)(2)’s prohibition of discriminatory\npractices. That may have been the issue before the\nCourt, but I do not view the quoted rationale as so\nlimited.\nunfair labor practices is necessary to\ncarry out any substantive section of the\nNLRA. Nevertheless, the majority\nconstrues AHA as an endorsement of\ndeference to the exercise of Section 6\nrulemaking authority whenever\nCongress did not expressly limit this\nauthority. This is patently incorrect. ‘‘To\nsuggest, as the [majority] effectively\ndoes, that Chevron deference is required\nany time a statute does not expressly\nnegate the existence of a claimed\nadministrative power * * *, is both\nflatly unfaithful to the principles of\nadministrative law * * * and refuted by\nprecedent.’’ Railway Labor Executives’\nAss’n v.

This belief is\nbased on: (1) Some studies indicating\nthat employees and high school\nstudents about to enter the work force\nare generally uninformed about labor\nlaw; (2) an influx of immigrants in the\nlabor force who are presumably also\nuninformed about labor law; (3) the\ncurrent low and declining percentage of\nunion-represented employees in the\nprivate sector, which presumably means\nthat unions are less likely to be a source\nof information about employee rights;\nand (4) the absence of any general legal\nrequirement that employers or anyone\nelse inform employees about their\nNLRA rights. 75 FR 80411.\nNeither the Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking nor today’s notice\nsummarizing comments in response to\nthat notice come anywhere close to\nproviding a substantial factual basis\nsupporting the belief that most\nemployees are unaware of their NLRA\nrights. As for the lack of high school\neducation on this subject, we have only\na few localized studies cited in a 1995\njournal article by a union attorney. 184\nWith respect to the assumption that\nimmigrants entering the work force, we\nhave even less, only anecdotal accounts.\nFor that matter, beyond the cited journal\narticle, almost all supposed factual\nsupport for the premise that employees\nare generally unaware of their rights\ncomes in comments received from\nindividuals, union organizers, attorneys\nrepresenting unions, and immigrant\nrights and worker assistance\norganizations agreeing, based on\nprofessed personal experience, that\nmost employees (obviously not\nincluding most of the employee\ncommenters) are unfamiliar with their\nNLRA rights. There are, as well,\nanecdotal accounts and comments from\nemployers, employer associations and\n184 Peter D. DeChiara, ‘‘The Right to Know: An\nArgument for Informing Employees of Their Rights\nunder the National Labor Relations Act,’’ 32 Harv.\nJ. on Legis. 431, at 436 and fn. 28 (1995).\nIn the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the\nmajority also relied on two articles by Professor\nCharles J. Morris, a co-petitioner for notice-posting\nrulemaking: ‘‘Renaissance at the NLRB—\nOpportunity and Prospect for Non-Legislative\nProcedural Reform at the Labor Board,’’ 23 Stetson\nL. Rev. 101, 107 (1993); and ‘‘NLRB Protection in\nthe Nonunion Workplace: A Glimpse at a General\nTheory of Section 7 Conduct,’’ 137 U. Pa. L. Rev.\n1673, 1675–1676 (1989). Professor Morris did not\nrefer to any specific evidence supporting a belief\nthat employees lack knowledge of their rights.\nmanagement attorneys to the opposite\neffect that the employees know about\ntheir rights under the Act, but my\ncolleagues find these less persuasive.\nIn any event, the partisan opinions\nand perceptions, although worthy of\nconsideration, ultimately fail as\nsubstantial evidence supporting the\nBoard majority’s initial premise for\nproposing the rule. There remains the\nBoard’s conclusion that the decline in\nunion density provides the missing\nfactual support. The majority explains\nthat there was less need for a posting of\ninformation about NLRA rights when\nthe union density was higher because\n‘‘friends and family who belonged to\nunions’’ would be a source of\ninformation. This is nothing more than\nsupposition. There is no empirical\nevidence of a correlation between union\ndensity and access to information about\nemployee rights, just as there are no\nbroad-based studies supporting the\nsuppositions about a lack of information\nstemming from high school curricula or\nthe influx of immigrants in the work\nforce.\nAt bottom, the inadequacy of the\nrecord to support my colleagues’ factual\npremise is of no matter to them. In\nresponse to comments contending that\nthe articles and studies they cite are old\nand inadequately supported, they glibly\nrespond that the commenters ‘‘cite no\nmore recent or better supported studies\nto the contrary,’’ as if opponents of the\nproposed rule bear that burden. Of\ncourse, it is the agency’s responsibility\nto make factual findings that support its\ndecision and those findings must be\nsupported by substantial evidence that\nmust examine the relevant data and\narticulate a satisfactory explanation for\nits action. Burlington Truck Lines, 371\nU.S. at 167.\nEven more telling is the majority’s\nfootnote observation that there is no real\nneed to conduct a study of the extent of\nemployees’ knowledge of NLRA rights\nbecause the notice posting rule would\nbe justified even if only 10 percent of\nthe workforce lacked such knowledge.\nThis statement betrays the entire factual\npremise upon which the rulemaking\ninitiative was purportedly founded and\nreveals a predisposition to issue the rule\nregardless of the facts. This is patently\n‘‘arbitrary and capricious.’’\nEven assuming, if we must, that there\nis some factual basis for a concern that\nemployees lack sufficient information\nabout their NLRA rights, the majority\nalso fails to provide a rational\nexplanation for why that concern\ndictates their choice made to address\nthat concern. Why, for instance, was a\nnoncompulsory information system,\nprimarily reliant on personal union\ncommunications, sufficient when the\nWagner Act was passed, but not now?\nThe union density levels for 1935 and\ntoday are roughly the same. 185 Why at\na time when the Board champions its\nnew Web site and the Acting General\nCounsel continues to encourage the\nregional outreach programs initiated by\nhis predecessor, do my colleagues so\nreadily dismiss the Board’s role in\nproviding information about rights\nunder the statute we administer? For\nthat matter, why are the numerous\nemployee, labor organizer, and worker\nadvocacy groups whose comments\nprofess awareness of these rights unable\nto communicate this information to\nthose who they know lack such\nawareness? Is the problem one of access\nor message? Would a reversal of the\nunion density trend or an increase in\npetition and charge filings be the only\nreliable indicators of increased\nawareness?\nI would think that a reasoned\nexplanation for the choice of a sweeping\nrule making it unlawful for employers to\nfail to post and maintain notice of\nemployee rights would at least include\nsome discussion of these questions and\nattempt to marshal more than a\nfragmented and inconclusive factual\nrecord to support their choice. The\nmajority fails to do so.

For the reasons stated in my\ndissenting opinion in J. Picini Flooring, 356 NLRB\nNo. 9 (2010), I also disagree with the rule’s\nrequirement that certain employers must also\nelectronically distribute the notice.\nwherever possible, when drafting\nregulations that will have a significant\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities. The focus of the RFA is to\nensure that agencies ‘‘review draft rules\nto assess and take appropriate account\nof the potential impact on small\nbusinesses, small governmental\njurisdictions, and small organizations,\nas provided by the [RFA].’’ E.O. 13272,\nSec. 1, 67 FR 53461 (‘‘Proper\nConsideration of Small Entities in\nAgency Rulemaking’’). However, an\nagency is not required to prepare a final\nregulatory flexibility analysis for a final\nrule if the agency head certifies that the\nrule will not, if promulgated, have a\nsignificant economic impact on a\nsubstantial number of small entities. 5\nU.S.C. 605(b). Based on the analysis\nbelow, in which the Board has\nestimated the financial burdens to\nemployers subject to the NLRA\nassociated with complying with the\nrequirements contained in this final\nrule, the Board has certified to the Chief\nCounsel for Advocacy of the Small\nBusiness Administration (SBA) that this\nrule will not have a significant\neconomic impact on a substantial\nnumber of small entities.\nThe primary goal of this rule is\nnotifying employees of their rights\nunder the NLRA. This goal is achieved\nthrough the posting of notices by\nemployers subject to the NLRA of the\nrights of employees under the NLRA.\nThe Board will make the notices\navailable at no cost to employers; there\nare no information collection, record\nkeeping, or reporting requirements.\nThe Board estimates that in order to\ncomply with this rule, each employer\nsubject to the NLRA will spend a total\nof 2 hours during the first year in which\nthe rule is in effect. This includes 30\nminutes for the employer to learn where\nand how to post the required notices, 30\nminutes to acquire the notices from the\nBoard or its Web site, and 60 minutes\nto post them physically and\nelectronically, depending on where and\nhow the employer customarily posts\nnotices to employees. The Board\nassumes that these activities will be\nperformed by a professional or business\nworker, who, according to Bureau of\nLabor Statistics data, earned a total\nhourly wage of about $32.20 in March\n2011, including fringe benefits. 190 The\n190 Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of\nLabor Statistics, ‘‘Economic News Release,’’ Table\nB–8, June 3, 2011 (available at http://www.bls.gov).\n(The Board is administratively informed that BLS\nestimates that fringe benefits are approximately\nequal to 40 percent of hourly wages.

Accordingly, this rule is\nestimated to impose average costs of\n$64.40 per employer subject to the\nNLRA (2 hours × $32.20) during the first\nyear. 191 These costs will decrease\ndramatically in subsequent years\nbecause the only employers affected\nwill be those that did not previously\nsatisfy their posting requirements or that\nhave since expanded their facilities or\nestablished new ones. Because the final\nrule will not require employers to post\nthe notice by email, instant messaging,\ntext messaging, and the like, the cost of\ncompliance should be, if anything,\nsomewhat less than the Board\npreviously estimated.\nAccording to the United States Census\nBureau, there were approximately 6\nmillion businesses with employees in\n2007. Of those, the SBA estimates that\nall but about 18,300 were small\nbusinesses with fewer than 500\nemployees. 192 This rule does not apply\nto employers that do not meet the\nBoard’s jurisdictional requirements, but\nbusiness workers were $23.00. Table B–8.\nAccordingly, the Board multiplied that number by\n1.4 to arrive at its estimate of $32.20 average hourly\nearnings, including fringe benefits.) In the NPRM,\nthe Board estimated hourly earnings of $31.02,\nbased on BLS data from January 2009. 75 FR 80415.\nThe estimate has been updated to reflect increases\nin hourly earnings since that time. Those increases\nhave been relatively minor, and do not affect the\nBoard’s conclusion that the economic impact of the\nrule will not be significant; see discussion below.\n191 The National Roofing Contractors Association\nasserts (without support) that ‘‘federal agencies\nhave a notoriously poor track record in estimating\nthe costs of new regulations on businesses’’; it\ntherefore predicts that ‘‘the actual cost for many\nemployers could be considerably higher.’’ The\nBoard recognizes that some employers, generally\nfirms with extensive and/or multiple facilities, may\nincur initial compliance costs in excess of the\nBoard’s estimate. For example, a company with\nmultiple locations may require more than 30\nminutes to physically post the notices on all of its\nvarious bulletin boards. The Board’s estimate,\nhowever, is an average for all employers; many\nsmall employers, especially those with only one\nfacility and/or limited electronic communication\nwith employees, may incur lower compliance costs.\nIn this regard, however, contrary to numerous\ncomments, such as that of St Mar Enterprises, Inc.,\nthe Board does not expect that the rule will be\n‘‘very burdensome’’ for businesses with more than\none facility. Normally, such firms should have to\nlearn about the rule’s requirements and acquire the\nnotices only once, no matter how many facilities are\ninvolved. The same should be true for electronic\nposting: downloading the notice and posting it on\nan employer’s Web site normally should have to be\ndone once for all facilities. Thus, the only\nadditional costs involved for multi-facility firms\nshould be those of physically posting the notices at\neach facility.\n192 Source: SBA Office of Advocacy estimates\nbased on data from the U.S. Department of\nCommerce, Bureau of the Census, and trends from\nthe U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, Business Employment Dynamics.\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54043\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nthe Board does not have the means to\ncalculate the number of small\nbusinesses within the Board’s\njurisdiction. Accordingly, the Board\nassumes for purposes of this analysis\nthat the great majority of the nearly 6\nmillion small businesses will be\naffected, and further that this number is\na substantial number within the\nmeaning of 5 U.S.C. 601. However, as\ndiscussed below, because the economic\nimpact on those employers is minimal,\nthe Board concludes that, under 5\nU.S.C. 605, the final rule will not have\na significant economic impact on any\nsmall employers.\nThe RFA does not define ‘‘significant\neconomic impact.’’ 5 U.S.C. 601. In the\nabsence of specific definitions, ‘‘what is\n‘significant’ * * * will vary depending\non the problem that needs to be\naddressed, the rule’s requirements, and\nthe preliminary assessment of the rule’s\nimpact.’’ See A Guide for Government\nAgencies: How to Comply with the\nRegulatory Flexibility Act, Office of\nAdvocacy, U.S. Small Business\nAdministration at 17 (available at\nhttp://www.sba.gov) (SBA Guide). As to\neconomic impact and whether it is\nsignificant, one important indicator is\nthe cost of compliance in relation to\nrevenue of the entity or the percentage\nof profits affected. Id. at 17. More\nspecifically, the criteria to be considered\nare:\n• Whether the rule will lead to longterm\ninsolvency, i.e., regulatory costs\nthat significantly reduce profits;\n• Whether the rule will lead to shortterm\ninsolvency, i.e., increasing\noperating expenses or new debt more\nthan cash reserves and cash flow can\nsupport, causing nonmarginal firms to\nclose;\n• Whether the rule will have\ndisproportionate effects, placing small\nentities at a significant competitive\ndisadvantage; and\n• Whether the rule will result in\ninefficiency, i.e., in social costs to small\nentities that outweigh the social benefits\nresulting from the rule. Id. at 26.\nApplying these standards, the Board\nconcludes that the economic impact of\nits notice-posting rule on small\nemployers is not significant. The Board\nhas determined that the average cost of\ncomplying with the rule in the first year\nfor all employers subject to the NLRA\nwill be $64.40. It is unlikely in the\nextreme that this minimal cost would\nlead to either the short- or long-term\ninsolvency of any business entity, or\nplace small employers at a competitive\ndisadvantage. Since this rule applies\nonly to organizations within the NLRB’s\njurisdictional standards, the smallest\nemployer subject to the rule must have\nan annual inflow or outflow across state\nlines of at least $50,000. Siemons\nMailing Service, 122 NLRB 81 (1959).\nGiven that the Board estimates that this\nrule will cost, on average, $64.40, the\ntotal cost for the smallest affected\ncompanies would be an amount equal to\nless than two-tenths of one percent of\nthat required annual inflow or outflow\n(.13%). The Board concludes that such\na small percentage is highly unlikely to\nadversely affect a small business. 193\nAnd, in the Board’s judgment, the social\nbenefits of employees’ (and employers’)\nbecoming familiar with employees’\nNLRA rights far outweigh the minimal\ncosts to employers of posting notices\ninforming employees of those rights. 194\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the\nBoard has concluded that the final rule\nwill not have a significant economic\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities. 5 U.S.C. 605.\nAs discussed in the NPRM, because it\nassumes that a substantial number of\nsmall businesses will be required to\ncomply with the rule, the Board\npreliminarily considered alternatives\nthat would minimize the impact of the\nrule, including a tiered approach for\nsmall entities with only a few\nemployees. However, as it also\nexplained, the Board rejected those\nalternatives, concluding that a tiered\napproach or an exemption for some\nsmall entities would substantially\nundermine the purpose of the rule\nbecause so many employers would be\nexempt under the SBA definitions.\nGiven the very small estimated cost of\ncompliance, it is possible that the\nburden on a small business of\ndetermining whether it fell into a\nparticular tier might exceed the burden\nof compliance. The Board further\npointed out that Congress gave the\nBoard very broad jurisdiction, with no\nsuggestion that it wanted to limit\ncoverage of any part of the NLRA to\nonly larger employers. The Board also\nbelieves that employees of small\nemployers have no less need of a Board\nnotice than have employees of larger\nemployers. Finally, the Board’s\njurisdictional standards mean that very\nsmall employers will not be covered by\nthe rule in any case. 75 FR 80416. (A\nsummary of the Board’s discretionary\njurisdictional standards appears in\n§ 104.204, below.) Thus, although\n193 In reaching this conclusion, the Board believes\nit is likely that employers that might otherwise be\nsignificantly affected even by the low cost of\ncompliance under this rule will not meet the\nBoard’s jurisdictional requirements, and\nconsequently those employers will not be subject to\nthis rule.\n194 See further discussion in section II, subsection\nC, Factual Support for the Rule, above.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nseveral comments urge that small\nemployers be exempted from the rule,\nthe Board remains persuaded, for the\nreasons set forth in the NPRM, that such\nan exemption is unwarranted. 195\nSome comments contend that, in\nconcluding that the proposed rule will\nnot have a significant impact on small\nemployers, the Board understates the\nrule’s actual prospective costs. One\ncomment, from Baker & Daniels LLP,\nargues that the Board improperly\nfocuses solely on the cost of complying\nwith the rule—i.e., of printing and\nposting the notice—and ignored the\n‘‘actual economic impact of the rule’s\neffect and purpose.’’ According to this\ncomment, it is predictable that, as more\nemployees become aware of their NLRA\nrights, they will file more unfair labor\npractice charges and elect unions to\nserve as their collective-bargaining\nrepresentatives. The comment further\nasserts that the Board has ignored the\n‘‘economic realities of unionization,’’\nspecifically that union wages are\ninflationary; that unions make business\nless flexible, less competitive, and less\nprofitable; and that unions cause job\nloss and stifle economic recovery from\nrecessions. Accordingly, this comment\ncontends that ‘‘the Board’s RFA\ncertification is invalid, and [that] the\nBoard must prepare an initial regulatory\nflexibility analysis.’’ Numerous other\ncomments echo similar concerns, but\nwithout reference to the RFA.\nThe Board disagrees with the\ncomment submitted by Baker & Daniels\nLLP. 196 Section 605(b) of the RFA states\nthat an agency need not prepare an\ninitial regulatory flexibility analysis if\nthe agency head certifies that the rule\n195 Cass County Electric Cooperative says that,\nafter estimating the average cost of compliance, ‘‘the\nNLRB quickly digresses into an attempt to estimate\nthe cost of the proposed rule on only small\nbusinesses.’’ The Board responds that in estimating\nthe cost of the rule on small businesses, it was\ndoing what the RFA explicitly requires (and that\nfocusing on small businesses, which comprise more\nthan 99 percent of potentially affected firms, is\nhardly a ‘‘digression’’). The comment also asserts\nthat the Board concluded ‘‘that the cost of\nestimating the implementation cost will likely\nexceed the cost of implementation, and thus is not\nwarranted. At best, this is a poor excuse to justify\nthe rule.’’ This misstates the Board’s observation\nthat ‘‘Given the very small estimated cost of\ncompliance, it is possible that the burden on a small\nbusiness of determining whether it fell into a\nparticular tier might exceed the burden of\ncompliance.’’ This observation was one of the\nreasons why the Board rejected a tiered approach\nto coverage for small entities, not an ‘‘excuse to\njustify the rule.’’ 75 FR 80416.\n196 In any event, the comment from Baker &\nDaniels LLP and related comments are difficult to\nsquare with the assertions made in numerous other\ncomments that the notice posting is unnecessary\nbecause employees are already well aware of their\nNLRA rights and have made informed decisions not\nto join unions or seek union representation.\n54044 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nwill not have a significant economic\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (emphasis\nadded). The Board understands the\n‘‘economic impact of * * * the rule’’ to\nrefer to the costs to affected entities of\ncomplying with the rule, not to the\neconomic impact of a series of\nsubsequent decisions made by\nindividual actors in the economy that\nare neither compelled by, nor the\ninevitable result of, the rule. 197 Even if\nmore employees opt for union\nrepresentation after learning about their\nrights, employers can avoid the adverse\neffects on business costs, flexibility, and\nprofitability predicted by Baker &\nDaniels LLP and other commenters by\nnot agreeing to unions’ demands that\nmight produce those effects. 198\nThe Board finds support for this view\nin the language of Section 603 of the\nRFA, which lists the items to be\nincluded in an initial regulatory\nflexibility analysis if one is required. 5\nU.S.C. 603. Section 603(a) states only\nthat such analysis ‘‘shall describe the\nimpact of the proposed rule on small\nentities.’’ 5 U.S.C. 603(a). However,\nSection 603(b) provides, as relevant\nhere, that ‘‘[e]ach initial regulatory\nflexibility analysis * * * shall\ncontain—* * *\n‘‘(4) a description of the projected\nreporting, recordkeeping and other\ncompliance requirements of the\nproposed rule, including an estimate of\nthe classes of small entities which will\nbe subject to the requirement and the\ntype of professional skills necessary for\npreparation of the report or record[.]’’ 5\nU.S.C. 603(b)(4) (emphasis added).

For example, Fisher and\nPhillips, a management law firm, urges\nthat the cost of legal fees should be\nincluded in assessing the economic\nimpact of the proposed rule: ‘‘[I]t might\nbe considered naïve to assume that a\nsignificant percentage of small\nemployers would not seek the advice of\ncounsel, and it would be equally naïve\nto assume that a significant percentage\nof those newly-engaged lawyers could\nbe retained for as little as $31.02/hour.’’\nThose comments are not persuasive.\nThe choice to retain counsel is not a\nrequirement for complying with the\nrule. This is not a complicated or\nnuanced rule. The employer is only\nrequired to post a notice provided by\nthe Board in the same manner in which\nthat employer customarily posts notices\nto its employees. The Board has\nexplained above what the rule’s\nelectronic posting provisions require of\nemployers in general, and it has\nsimplified those provisions by\neliminating the requirement that notices\nbe provided by email and many other\nforms of electronic communication. 201 It\n200 Baker & Daniels LLP cites no authority to\nsupport its contention that the RFA is concerned\nwith costs other than the costs of compliance with\nthe rule, and the Board is aware of none.\n201 Contrary to ABC’s and RILA’s assertions, the\nBoard did estimate the cost of complying with the\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nshould not be necessary for employers,\nsmall or large, to add human resources\nstaff, retain counsel, or resort to\nlitigation if they have questions\nconcerning whether the proposed rule\napplies to them or about the\nrequirements for technical compliance\nwith the rule, including how the\nelectronic posting provisions\nspecifically affect their enterprises. 202\nSuch questions can be directed to the\nBoard’s regional offices, either by\ntelephone, personal visit, email, or\nregular mail, and will be answered free\nof charge by representatives of the\nBoard. 203\nCass County Electric Cooperative\nargues that the Board failed to take into\naccount legal expenses that employers\nwill incur if they fail to ‘‘follow the\nletter of the proposed rule.’’ The\ncomment urges that the Board should\nestimate the cost to businesses ‘‘should\nthey have to defend themselves against\nan unfair labor practice for failure to\ncomply with the rule, no matter what\nthe circumstances for that failure might\nbe,’’ presumably including failures to\npost the notice by employers that are\nunaware of the rule and inadvertent\nfailures to comply with technical\nposting requirements. International\nFoodservice Distributors Association\ncontends that the Board also should\nhave considered the costs of tolling the\nstatute of limitations when employers\nfail to post the notice. However, the\ncosts referred to in these comments are\ncosts of not complying with the rule, not\ncompliance costs. As stated above, for\nRFA purposes, the relevant economic\nanalysis focuses on the costs of\ncomplying with the rule. 204\nrule’s electronic notice posting requirements; its\nestimated average cost of $62.04 specifically\nincluded such costs. 75 FR 80415. Although ABC\nfaults the Board for failing to issue a preliminary\nrequest for information (RFI) concerning the ways\nemployers communicate with employees\nelectronically, the Board did ask for comments\nconcerning its RFA certification in the NPRM, id.\nat 80416. In this regard, ABC states only that ‘‘many\nABC member companies communicate with\nemployees through email or other electronic\nmeans,’’ which the Board expressly contemplated\nin the NPRM, id. at 80413, and which is also the\nBoard’s practice with respect to communicating\nwith its own employees. If ABC has more specific\ninformation it has failed to provide it. In any event,\nthe final rule will not require email or many other\ntypes of electronic notice.\n202 Association of Corporate Counsel contends\nthat employers will have to modify their policies\nand procedures manuals as a result of the rule. The\nBoard questions that contention, but even if some\nemployers do take those steps, they would not be\na cost of complying with the rule.\n203 Fisher and Phillips also suggest that the Board\nfailed to take into account the effect that the\nproposed rule would have on the Board’s own case\nintake and budget. The RFA, however, does not\nrequire an estimate of the economic effects of\nproposed rules on Federal agencies.\n204 See fn. 197, above.\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54045\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nSome comments assert that the\ncontent of the notice will prompt\nemployee questions, which managers\nand supervisors will have to answer,\nand be trained to answer, and that the\nBoard failed to account for the cost of\nsuch training and discussions in terms\nof lost work time. 205 Other comments\ncontend that employers will incur costs\nof opposing an increased number of\nunion organizing campaigns. 206\nRelatedly, several comments state that\nemployers should be allowed to, and/or\nwill respond to the notice by informing\nemployees of aspects of unionization\nand collective bargaining that are not\ncovered by the notice; some suggest that\nemployers may post their own notices\npresenting their point of view. 207 (A few\ncomments, by contrast, protest that\nemployers will be prohibited from\npresenting their side of the issues raised\nby the posting of notices.) The Board\nresponds that any costs that employers\nmay incur in responding to employee\nquestions, in setting forth the\nemployers’ views on unions and\ncollective bargaining, or in opposing\nunion organizing efforts will be incurred\nentirely at the employers’ own volition;\nthey are not a cost of complying with\nthe rule.\nAs discussed above, many comments\nexpress concerns that union supporters\nwill tear down the notices in order to\nexpose employers to 8(a)(1) liability for\nfailing to post the notices. Some of these\ncomments also contend that, as a result,\nemployers will have to spend\nconsiderable time monitoring the\nnotices to make sure that they are not\ntorn down, or incur additional costs of\ninstalling tamper-proof bulletin boards.\nOne commenter predicts that his\nemployer will have to spend $20,000 for\nsuch bulletin boards at a single facility,\nor a total of $100,000 at all of its\nfacilities, and even then will have to\nspend two hours each month\nmonitoring the postings. For the reasons\ndiscussed above, the Board is not\nconvinced at this time that the problem\nof posters being torn down is anything\nmore than speculative, and accordingly\nis inclined to discount these predictions\nsubstantially. In any event, the rule\nrequires only that employers ‘‘take\nreasonable steps’’—not every\nconceivable step—to ensure that the\n205 See, e.g., comments of Cass County Electric\nCooperative and Baker & McKenzie. The latter\nestimates that each private sector employee will\nspend at least an hour attending meetings\nconcerning the content of the notice, and that the\ncost to the economy in terms of lost employee work\ntime will be $3.5 billion.\n206 See, e.g., comment of Dr. Pepper Snapple\nGroup.\n207 See, e.g., comments of Metro Toyota and\nCapital Associated Industries, Inc.\nnotice is not defaced or torn down. The\nrule does not require, or even suggest,\nthat employers must spend thousands of\ndollars to install tamper-proof bulletin\nboards or that employers must\nconstantly monitor the notice. 208\nOne comment contends that most\nsmall employers do not have 11 x 17-\ninch color printers, and therefore will\nhave to have the posters printed\ncommercially at a cost that, alone,\nassertedly will exceed the Board’s\nestimate of the cost of the rule. The\nBoard understands the concerns of this\nsmall employer. The Board points out\nthat it will furnish a reasonable number\nof copies of the notice free of charge to\nany requesting employer. Moreover, as\nexplained above, employers may\nreproduce the notice in black-and-white\nand may print the notice on two\nstandard-sized, 8.5 x 11-inch pages and\ntape or bind them together, rather than\nhaving them printed commercially.\nA number of comments argue that the\nrule will lead to workplace conflict. For\nexample, the comment of Wiseda\nCorporation contains the following:\nUnnecessary Confusion and Conflict in the\nWorkplace. The labor law terms and\nindustrial union language of the proposed\nnotice (such as hiring hall and concerted\nactivity) present an unclear and adversarial\npicture to employees. Most non-union\nemployers like us, who wish to remain nonunion,\nencourage cooperative problem\nsolving. In a modern non-union workplace,\nto require such a poster encouraging strikes\nand restroom leaflets is disrespectful of the\nhard work and good intentions of employers,\nmanagement, and employees. The proposed\nposter would exist alongside other company\nnotices on problem-solving, respect for\nothers, resolving harassment issues, etc., and\nwould clearly be out of character and\ninappropriate. (Emphasis in original.)\nAnother comment puts it more bluntly:\n‘‘The notice as proposed is more of an\ninvitation to cause employee/employer\ndisputes rather than an explanation of\nemployee rights.’’ The Board’s response\nis that the ill effects predicted in these\ncomments, like the predicted adverse\neffects of unionization discussed above,\nare not costs of compliance with the\nrule, but of employees’ learning about\ntheir workplace rights. In addition,\nCongress, not the Board, created the\nsubject rights and did so after finding\nthat vesting employees with these rights\nwould reduce industrial strife.\nB.

As noted in § 104.202(e),\nthe Board will make the notice\navailable, and employers will be\npermitted to post copies of the notice\nthat are exact duplicates in content,\nsize, format, and type size and style.\nUnder the regulations implementing the\nPRA, ‘‘[t]he public disclosure of\ninformation originally supplied by the\nFederal government to [a] recipient for\nthe purpose of disclosure to the public’’\nis not considered a ‘‘collection of\ninformation’’ under the Act. See 5 CFR\n1320.3(c)(2). Therefore, contrary to\nseveral comments, the posting\nrequirement is not subject to the\nPRA. 210\nThe Board received no comments\nsuggesting that the PRA covers the costs\nto the Federal government of\nadministering the regulations\nestablished by the proposed rule.\nTherefore, the NPRM’s discussion of\nthis issue stands.\nAccordingly, this rule does not\ncontain information collection\nrequirements that require approval by\nthe Office of Management and Budget\nunder the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.).\nC. Congressional Review Act (CRA) 211\nThis rule is a ‘‘major rule’’ as defined\nby Section 804(2) of the Small Business\nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of\n1996 (Congressional Review Act),\nbecause it will have an effect on the\neconomy of more than $100 million, at\nleast during the year it takes effect. 5\nU.S.C. 804(2)(A). 212 Accordingly, the\n210 The California Chamber of Commerce and the\nNational Council of Agricultural Employers dispute\nthis conclusion. They assert that the PRA\ndistinguishes between the ‘‘agencies’’ to which it\napplies and the ‘‘Federal government,’’ and\ntherefore that the exemption provided in 5 CFR\n1320.3(c)(2) applies only to information supplied by\n‘‘the actual Federal government,’’ not to information\nsupplied by a Federal agency such as the Board.\nThe flaw in this argument is that there is no such\nlegal entity as ‘‘the [actual] Federal government.’’\nWhat is commonly referred to as ‘‘the Federal\ngovernment’’ is a collection of the three branches\nof the United States government, including the\ndepartments of the executive branch, and the\nvarious independent agencies, including the Board.\nIf ‘‘the Federal government’’ can be said to act at\nall, it can do so only through one or more of those\nentities—in this instance, the Board—and that is\nundoubtedly the meaning that the drafters of 5 CFR\n1320(c)(2) meant to convey.\n211 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.\n212 A rule is a ‘‘major rule’’ for CRA purposes if\nit will (A) Have an annual effect on the economy\nof $100 million or more; (B) cause a major increase\nin costs or prices for consumers, individual\nindustries, government agencies, or geographic\nregions; or (C) result in significant adverse effects\non competition, employment, investment,\nproductivity, innovation, or the ability of United\nStates-based enterprises to compete with foreignbased\nenterprises in domestic and export markets.\n5 U.S.C. 804.

The\nBoard therefore expects that the costs of compliance\nwill be far less than $100 million in the second and\nsubsequent years. The Board is confident that the\nrule will have none of the effects enumerated in 5\nU.S.C. 804(2)(B) and (C) above.\n213 The Board finds unpersuasive the suggestions\nin several comments that the effective date of the\nrule be postponed to as late as April 15, 2012.

The term\nincludes anyone whose work has ceased\nbecause of, or in connection with, any\ncurrent labor dispute or because of any\nunfair labor practice, and who has not\nobtained any other regular and\nsubstantially equivalent employment.\nHowever, it does not include\nagricultural laborers, supervisors, or\nindependent contractors, or anyone\nemployed in the domestic service of any\nfamily or person at his home, or by his\nparent or spouse, or by an employer\nsubject to the Railway Labor Act (45\nU.S.C. 151 et seq.), or by any other\nperson who is not an employer as\ndefined in the NLRA. 29 U.S.C. 152(3).\nEmployee notice means the notice set\nforth in the Appendix to Subpart A of\nthis part that employers subject to the\nNLRA must post pursuant to this part.\nEmployer includes any person acting\nas an agent of an employer, directly or\nindirectly. The term does not include\nthe United States or any wholly owned\nGovernment corporation, or any Federal\nReserve Bank, or any State or political\nsubdivision thereof, or any person\nsubject to the Railway Labor Act, or any\nlabor organization (other than when\nacting as an employer), or anyone acting\nin the capacity of officer or agent of\nsuch labor organization. 29 U.S.C.\n152(2).

The\nnotice to employees shall be at least 11\ninches by 17 inches in size, and in such\nformat, type size, and style as the Board\nshall prescribe. If an employer chooses\nto print the notice after downloading it\nfrom the Board’s Web site, the printed\nnotice shall be at least 11 inches by 17\ninches in size.\n(c) Adaptation of language. The\nNational Labor Relations Board may\nfind that an Act of Congress,\nclarification of existing law by the\ncourts or the Board, or other\ncircumstances make modification of the\nemployee notice necessary to achieve\nthe purposes of this part. In such\ncircumstances, the Board will promptly\nissue rules, regulations, or orders as are\nneeded to ensure that all future\nemployee notices contain appropriate\nlanguage to achieve the purposes of this\npart.\n(d) Physical posting of employee\nnotice. The employee notice must be\nposted in conspicuous places where\nthey are readily seen by employees,\nincluding all places where notices to\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54047\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nemployees concerning personnel rules\nor policies are customarily posted.\nWhere 20 percent or more of an\nemployer’s workforce is not proficient\nin English and speaks a language other\nthan English, the employer must post\nthe notice in the language employees\nspeak. If an employer’s workforce\nincludes two or more groups\nconstituting at least 20 percent of the\nworkforce who speak different\nlanguages, the employer must either\nphysically post the notice in each of\nthose languages or, at the employer’s\noption, post the notice in the language\nspoken by the largest group of\nemployees and provide each employee\nin each of the other language groups a\ncopy of the notice in the appropriate\nlanguage. If an employer requests from\nthe Board a notice in a language in\nwhich it is not available, the requesting\nemployer will not be liable for noncompliance\nwith the rule until the\nnotice becomes available in that\nlanguage. An employer must take\nreasonable steps to ensure that the\nnotice is not altered, defaced, covered\nby any other material, or otherwise\nrendered unreadable.\n(e) Obtaining a poster with the\nemployee notice. A poster with the\nrequired employee notice, including a\nposter with the employee notice\ntranslated into languages other than\nEnglish, will be printed by the Board,\nand may be obtained from the Board’s\noffice, 1099 14th Street, NW.,\nWashington, DC 20570, or from any of\nthe Board’s regional, subregional, or\nresident offices. Addresses and\ntelephone numbers of those offices may\nbe found on the Board’s Web site at\nhttp://www.nlrb.gov. A copy of the\nposter in English and in languages other\nthan English may also be downloaded\nfrom the Board’s Web site at http://\nwww.nlrb.gov. Employers also may\nreproduce and use copies of the Board’s\nofficial poster, provided that the copies\nduplicate the official poster in size,\ncontent, format, and size and style of\ntype. In addition, employers may use\ncommercial services to provide the\nemployee notice poster consolidated\nonto one poster with other Federally\nmandated labor and employment\nnotices, so long as the consolidation\ndoes not alter the size, content, format,\nor size and style of type of the poster\nprovided by the Board.\n(f) Electronic posting of employee\nnotice. (1) In addition to posting the\nrequired notice physically, an employer\nmust also post the required notice on an\nintranet or internet site if the employer\ncustomarily communicates with its\nemployees about personnel rules or\npolicies by such means. An employer\nthat customarily posts notices to\nemployees about personnel rules or\npolicies on an intranet or internet site\nwill satisfy the electronic posting\nrequirement by displaying\nprominently—i.e., no less prominently\nthan other notices to employees—on\nsuch a site either an exact copy of the\nposter, downloaded from the Board’s\nWeb site, or a link to the Board’s Web\nsite that contains the poster. The link to\nthe Board’s Web site must read,\n‘‘Employee Rights under the National\nLabor Relations Act.’’\n(2) Where 20 percent or more of an\nemployer’s workforce is not proficient\nin English and speaks a language other\nthan English, the employer must\nprovide notice as required in paragraph\n(f)(1) of this section in the language the\nemployees speak. If an employer’s\nworkforce includes two or more groups\nconstituting at least 20 percent of the\nworkforce who speak different\nlanguages, the employer must provide\nthe notice in each such language. The\nBoard will provide translations of the\nlink to the Board’s Web site for any\nemployer that must or wishes to display\nthe link on its Web site. If an employer\nrequests from the Board a notice in a\nlanguage in which it is not available, the\nrequesting employer will not be liable\nfor non-compliance with the rule until\nthe notice becomes available in that\nlanguage.\n§ 104.203 Are Federal contractors covered\nunder this part?\nYes, Federal contractors are covered.\nHowever, contractors may comply with\nthe provisions of this part by posting the\nnotices to employees required under the\nDepartment of Labor’s notice-posting\nrule, 29 CFR part 471.\n§ 104.204 What entities are not subject to\nthis part?\n(a) The following entities are\nexcluded from the definition of\n‘‘employer’’ under the National Labor\nRelations Act and are not subject to the\nrequirements of this part:\nEmployer category\nTABLE TO § 104.204\nAmusement industry ............................................................................................................................ $500,000.\nApartment houses, condominiums, cooperatives ................................................................................ $500,000.\nArchitects .............................................................................................................................................

The most\ncommonly applicable standards are:\n(i) The retail standard, which applies\nto employers in retail businesses,\nincluding home construction. The Board\nwill take jurisdiction over any such\nemployer that has a gross annual\nvolume of business of $500,000 or more.\n(ii) The nonretail standard, which\napplies to most other employers. It is\nbased either on the amount of goods\nsold or services provided by the\nemployer out of state (called ‘‘outflow’’)\nor goods or services purchased by the\nemployer from out of state (called\n‘‘inflow’’). The Board will take\njurisdiction over any employer with an\nannual inflow or outflow of at least\n$50,000. Outflow can be either direct—\nto out-of-state purchasers—or indirect—\nto purchasers that meet other\njurisdictional standards. Inflow can also\nbe direct—purchased directly from out\nof state—or indirect—purchased from\nsellers within the state that purchased\nthem from out-of-state sellers.\n(2) There are other standards for\nmiscellaneous categories of employers.\nThese standards are based on the\nemployer’s gross annual volume of\nbusiness unless stated otherwise.

Employees\ncovered by the NLRA* are protected from\ncertain types of employer and union\nmisconduct. This Notice gives you general\ninformation about your rights, and about the\nobligations of employers and unions under\nthe NLRA. Contact the National Labor\nRelations Board (NLRB), the Federal agency\nthat investigates and resolves complaints\nunder the NLRA, using the contact\ninformation supplied below, if you have any\nquestions about specific rights that may\napply in your particular workplace.\n‘‘Under the NLRA, you have the right to:\n• Organize a union to negotiate with your\nemployer concerning your wages, hours, and\nother terms and conditions of employment.\n• Form, join or assist a union.\n• Bargain collectively through\nrepresentatives of employees’ own choosing\nfor a contract with your employer setting\nyour wages, benefits, hours, and other\nworking conditions.\n• Discuss your wages and benefits and\nother terms and conditions of employment or\nunion organizing with your co-workers or a\nunion.\n• Take action with one or more co-workers\nto improve your working conditions by,\namong other means, raising work-related\ncomplaints directly with your employer or\nwith a government agency, and seeking help\nfrom a union.\n• Strike and picket, depending on the\npurpose or means of the strike or the\npicketing.\n• Choose not to do any of these activities,\nincluding joining or remaining a member of\na union.\n‘‘Under the NLRA, it is illegal for your\nemployer to:\n• Prohibit you from talking about or\nsoliciting for a union during non-work time,\nsuch as before or after work or during break\ntimes; or from distributing union literature\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\nduring non-work time, in non-work areas,\nsuch as parking lots or break rooms.\n• Question you about your union support\nor activities in a manner that discourages you\nfrom engaging in that activity.\n• Fire, demote, or transfer you, or reduce\nyour hours or change your shift, or otherwise\ntake adverse action against you, or threaten\nto take any of these actions, because you join\nor support a union, or because you engage in\nconcerted activity for mutual aid and\nprotection, or because you choose not to\nengage in any such activity.\n• Threaten to close your workplace if\nworkers choose a union to represent them.\n• Promise or grant promotions, pay raises,\nor other benefits to discourage or encourage\nunion support.\n• Prohibit you from wearing union hats,\nbuttons, t-shirts, and pins in the workplace\nexcept under special circumstances.\n• Spy on or videotape peaceful union\nactivities and gatherings or pretend to do so.\n‘‘Under the NLRA, it is illegal for a union\nor for the union that represents you in\nbargaining with your employer to:\n• Threaten or coerce you in order to gain\nyour support for the union.\n• Refuse to process a grievance because\nyou have criticized union officials or because\nyou are not a member of the union.\n• Use or maintain discriminatory\nstandards or procedures in making job\nreferrals from a hiring hall.\n• Cause or attempt to cause an employer\nto discriminate against you because of your\nunion-related activity.\n• Take adverse action against you because\nyou have not joined or do not support the\nunion.\n‘‘If you and your co-workers select a union\nto act as your collective bargaining\nrepresentative, your employer and the union\nFederal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\n54049\nmstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2\nare required to bargain in good faith in a\ngenuine effort to reach a written, binding\nagreement setting your terms and conditions\nof employment. The union is required to\nfairly represent you in bargaining and\nenforcing the agreement.\n‘‘Illegal conduct will not be permitted. If\nyou believe your rights or the rights of others\nhave been violated, you should contact the\nNLRB promptly to protect your rights,\ngenerally within six months of the unlawful\nactivity. You may inquire about possible\nviolations without your employer or anyone\nelse being informed of the inquiry. Charges\nmay be filed by any person and need not be\nfiled by the employee directly affected by the\nviolation. The NLRB may order an employer\nto rehire a worker fired in violation of the\nlaw and to pay lost wages and benefits, and\nmay order an employer or union to cease\nviolating the law. Employees should seek\nassistance from the nearest regional NLRB\noffice, which can be found on the Agency’s\nWeb site: http://www.nlrb.gov.\nYou can also contact the NLRB by calling\ntoll-free: 1–866–667–NLRB (6572) or (TTY)\n1–866–315–NLRB (1–866–315–6572) for\nhearing impaired.\nIf you do not speak or understand English\nwell, you may obtain a translation of this\nnotice from the NLRB’s Web site or by calling\nthe toll-free numbers listed above.\n‘‘*The National Labor Relations Act covers\nmost private-sector employers. Excluded\nfrom coverage under the NLRA are publicsector\nemployees, agricultural and domestic\nworkers, independent contractors, workers\nemployed by a parent or spouse, employees\nof air and rail carriers covered by the Railway\nLabor Act, and supervisors (although\nsupervisors that have been discriminated\nagainst for refusing to violate the NLRA may\nbe covered).\n‘‘This is an official Government Notice and\nmust not be defaced by anyone.’’\nSubpart B—General Enforcement and\nComplaint Procedures\n§ 104.210 How will the Board determine\nwhether an employer is in compliance with\nthis part?\nThe Board has determined that\nemployees must be aware of their NLRA\nrights in order to exercise those rights\neffectively. Employers subject to this\nrule are required to post the employee\nnotice to inform employees of their\nrights. Failure to post the employee\nnotice may be found to interfere with,\nrestrain, or coerce employees in the\nexercise of the rights guaranteed by\nNLRA Section 7, 29 U.S.C. 157, in\nviolation of NLRA Section 8(a)(1), 29\nU.S.C. 158(a)(1).\nNormally, the Board will determine\nwhether an employer is in compliance\nwhen a person files an unfair labor\npractice charge alleging that the\nemployer has failed to post the\nemployee notice required under this\npart. Filing a charge sets in motion the\nBoard’s procedures for investigating and\nadjudicating alleged unfair labor\npractices, and for remedying conduct\nthat the Board finds to be unlawful. See\nNLRA Sections 10–11, 29 U.S.C. 160–\n61, and 29 CFR part 102, subpart B.\n§ 104.211 What are the procedures for\nfiling a charge?\n(a) Filing charges. Any person (other\nthan Board personnel) may file a charge\nwith the Board alleging that an\nemployer has failed to post the\nemployee notice as required by this\npart. A charge should be filed with the\nRegional Director of the Region in\nwhich the alleged failure to post the\nrequired notice is occurring.\n(b) Contents of charges. The charge\nmust be in writing and signed, and must\nbe sworn to before a Board agent, notary\npublic, or other person authorized to\nadminister oaths or take\nacknowledgements, or contain a\ndeclaration by the person signing it,\nunder penalty of perjury, that its\ncontents are true and correct. The\ncharge must include:\n(1) The charging party’s full name and\naddress;\n(2) If the charge is filed by a union,\nthe full name and address of any\nnational or international union of which\nit is an affiliate or constituent unit;\n(3) The full name and address of the\nemployer alleged to have violated this\npart; and\n(4) A clear and concise statement of\nthe facts constituting the alleged unfair\nlabor practice.\n§ 104.212 What are the procedures to be\nfollowed when a charge is filed alleging that\nan employer has failed to post the required\nemployee notice?\n(a) When a charge is filed with the\nBoard under this section, the Regional\nDirector will investigate the allegations\nof the charge. If it appears that the\nallegations are true, the Regional\nDirector will make reasonable efforts to\npersuade the respondent employer to\npost the required employee notice\nexpeditiously. If the employer does so,\nthe Board expects that there will rarely\nbe a need for further administrative\nproceedings.\n(b) If an alleged violation cannot be\nresolved informally, the Regional\nDirector may issue a formal complaint\nagainst the respondent employer,\nalleging a violation of the notice-posting\nrequirement and scheduling a hearing\nbefore an administrative law judge.\nAfter a complaint issues, the matter will\nbe adjudicated in keeping with the\nBoard’s customary procedures. See\nNLRA Sections 10 and 11, 29 U.S.C.\n160, 161; 29 CFR part 102, subpart B.\nVerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2\n§ 104.213 What remedies are available to\ncure a failure to post the employee notice?\n(a) If the Board finds that the\nrespondent employer has failed to post\nthe required employee notices as\nalleged, the respondent will be ordered\nto cease and desist from the unlawful\nconduct and post the required employee\nnotice, as well as a remedial notice. In\nsome instances additional remedies may\nbe appropriately invoked in keeping\nwith the Board’s remedial authority.\n(b) Any employer that threatens or\nretaliates against an employee for filing\ncharges or testifying at a hearing\nconcerning alleged violations of the\nnotice-posting requirement may be\nfound to have committed an unfair labor\npractice. See NLRA Section 8(a)(1) and\n8(a)(4), 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1), (4).\n§ 104.214 How might other Board\nproceedings be affected by failure to post\nthe employee notice?\n(a) Tolling of statute of limitations.\nWhen an employee files an unfair labor\npractice charge, the Board may find it\nappropriate to excuse the employee\nfrom the requirement that charges be\nfiled within six months after the\noccurrence of the allegedly unlawful\nconduct if the employer has failed to\npost the required employee notice\nunless the employee has received actual\nor constructive notice that the conduct\ncomplained of is unlawful. See NLRA\nSection 10(b), 29 U.S.C. 160(b).\n(b) Noncompliance as evidence of\nunlawful motive. The Board may\nconsider a knowing and willful refusal\nto comply with the requirement to post\nthe employee notice as evidence of\nunlawful motive in a case in which\nmotive is an issue.\nSubpart C—Ancillary Matters\n§ 104.220 What other provisions apply to\nthis part?\n(a) The regulations in this part do not\nmodify or affect the interpretation of\nany other NLRB regulations or policy.\n(b)(1) This subpart does not impair or\notherwise affect:\n(i) Authority granted by law to a\ndepartment, agency, or the head thereof;\nor\n(ii) Functions of the Director of the\nOffice of Management and Budget\nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or\nlegislative proposals.\n(2) This subpart must be implemented\nconsistent with applicable law and\nsubject to the availability of\nappropriations.\n(c) This part creates no right or\nbenefit, substantive or procedural,\nenforceable at law or in equity by any\nparty against the United States, its\ndepartments, agencies, or entities, its\n54050 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations\nofficers, employees, or agents, or any\nother person.\nSigned in Washington, DC, August 22,\n2011.\nWilma B.
