    "full_text": "﻿THE WHITE HOUSE \nWASHINGTON \nFebruary 2, 2018 \nThe Honorable Devin Nunes \nChaiiman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \nUnited States Capitol \nWashington, DC 20515 \nDear Mr. Chaiiiiian: \nOn January 29, 2018, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (hereinafter \"the \nCommittee\") voted to disclose publicly a memorandum containing classified information \nprovided to the Committee in connection with its oversight activities (the \"Memorandum,\" \nwhich is attached to this letter). As provided by clause 11(g) of Rule X of the House of \nRepresentatives, the Committee has forwarded this Memorandum to the President based on its \ndetennination that the release of the Memorandum would serve the public interest. \nThe Constitution vests the President with the authority to protect national security secrets from \ndisclosure. As the Supreme Court has recognized, it is the President's responsibility to classify, \ndeclassify, and control access to information bearing on our intelligence sources and methods \nand national defense. See, e.g., Dep 't of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). In order to \nfacilitate appropriate congressional oversight, the Executive Branch may entrust classified \ninformation to the appropriate committees of Congress, as it has done in connection with the \nCommittee's oversight activities here. The Executive Branch does so on the assumption that the \nCommittee will responsibly protect such classified information, consistent with the laws of the \nUnited States. \nThe Committee has now determined that the release of the Memorandum would be appropriate. \nThe Executive Branch, across Administrations of both parties, has worked to accommodate \ncongressional requests to declassify specific materials in the public interest.1 However, public \nrelease of classified information by unilateral action of the Legislative Branch is extremely rare \nand raises significant separation of powers concerns. Accordingly, the Committee's request to \nrelease the Memorandum is interpreted as a request for declassification pursuant to the \nPresident's authority. \nThe President understands that the protection of our national security represents his highest \nobligation. Accordingly, he has directed lawyers and national security staff to assess the \nSee, e.g., S. Rept. 114-8 at 12 (Administration of Barack Obama) (\"On April 3, 2014. . . the Committee agreed to \nsend the revised Findings and Conclusions, and the updated Executive Summary of the Committee Study, to the \nPresident for declassification and public release.\"); H. Rept. 107-792 (Administration of George W. Bush) (similar); \nE.O. 12812 (Administration of George H.W. Bush) (noting Senate resolution requesting that President provide for \ndeclassification of certain information via Executive Order). \n\fdeclassification request, consistent with established standards governing the handling of \nclassified information, including those under Section 3.1(d) of Executive Order 13526. Those \nstandards permit declassification when the public interest in disclosure outweighs any need to \nprotect the information. The White House review process also included input from the Office of \nthe Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice. Consistent with this review \nand these standards, the President has determined that declassification of the Memorandum is \nappropriate. \nBased on this assessment and in light of the significant public interest in the memorandum, the \nPresident has authorized the declassification of the Memorandum. To be clear, the \nMemorandum reflects the judgments of its congressional authors. The President understands \nthat oversight concerning matters related to the Memorandum may be continuing. Though the \ncircumstances leading to the declassification through this process are extraordinary, the \nExecutive Branch stands ready to work with Congress to accommodate oversight requests \nconsistent with applicable standards and processes, including the need to protect intelligence \nsources and methods. \nSincerely, \nDonald F. McGahn II \nCounsel to the President \ncc: The Honorable Paul Ryan \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives \nThe Honorable Adam Schiff \nRanking Member, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \n\fUN \".-1 \nTo: \nFrom: \nSubject: Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Abuses at the Department of Justice and the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation \nASSIHEir\"\"\"\"\"s\" \nDeclassified by order of the President \nFebruary 2, 2018 \nJanuary 18, 2018 \nHPSCI Majority Members \nHPSCI Majority Staff \nPurpose \nThis memorandum provides Members an update on significant facts relating to the \nCommittee's ongoing investigation into the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) and their use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) during the \n2016 presidential election cycle. Our findings, which are detailed below, 1) raise concerns with \nthe legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court (FISC), and 2) represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established \nto protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process. \nInvestigation Update \nOn October 21, 2016, DOJ and FBI sought and received a FISA probable cause order \n(not under Title VII) authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page from the FISC. Page is a \nU.S. citizen who served as a volunteer advisor to the Trump presidential campaign. Consistent \nwith requirements under FISA, the application had to be first certified by the Director or Deputy \nDirector of the FBI. It then required the approval of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney \nGeneral (DAG), or the Senate-confirmed Assistant Attorney General for the National Security \nDivision. \nThe FBI and DOJ obtained one initial FISA warrant targeting Carter Page and three FISA \nrenewals from the FISC. As required by statute (50 U.S.C. §1805(d)(1)), a FISA order on an \nAmerican citizen must be renewed by the FISC every 90 days and each renewal requires a \nseparate finding of probable cause. Then-Director James Comey signed three FISA applications \nin question on behalf of the FBI, and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one. Then-DAG \nSally Yates, then-Acting DAG Dana Boente, and DAG Rod Rosenstein each signed one or more \nFISA applications on behalf of DOJ. \nDue to the sensitive nature of foreign intelligence activity, FISA submissions (including \nrenewals) before the FISC are classified. As such, the public's confidence in the integrity of the \nFISA process depends on the court's ability to hold the government to the highest standard—\nparticularly as it relates to surveillance of American citizens. However, the FISC' s rigor in \nprotecting the rights of Americans, which is rem orce 5y9 -day renewals of surveillance \norders, is necessarily dependent on the government's production to the court of all material and \nrelevant facts. This should include infoimation potentially favorable to the target of the FISA \nlk.J1 LA-1\\-L,1/I1V,11V71\\1116 \nPROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n\fapplication that is known by the government. In the case of Carter Page, the government had at \nleast four independent opportunities before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the \nrelevant facts. However, our findings indicate that, as described below, material and relevant \ninformation was omitted. \n1) The \"dossier\" compiled by Christopher Steele (Steele dossier) on behalf of the \nDemocratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign foimed an \nessential part of the Carter Page FISA application. Steele was a longtime FBI source who \nwas paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign, via the law firm Perkins Coie \nand research firm Fusion GPS, to obtain derogatory infoiniation on Donald Trump's ties \nto Russia. \na) Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or \nreference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding \nSteele's efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then \nknown to senior DOJ and FBI officials. \nb) The initial FISA application notes Steele was working for a named U.S. person, but \ndoes not name Fusion GPS and principal Glenn Simpson, who was paid by a U.S. law \nfirm (Perkins Coie) representing the DNC (even though it was known by DOJ at the \ntime that political actors were involved with the Steele dossier). The application does \nnot mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of___and paid by—the DNC and \nClinton campaign, or that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele for the \nsame information. \n2) The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016, Yahoo \nNews article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow. \nThis article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information \nleaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News. The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses \nthat Steele did not directly provide infoimation to Yahoo News. Steele has admitted in \nBritish court filings that he met with Yahoo News—and several other outlets—in \nSeptember 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele's \ninitial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington D.C. in \n2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed. \na) Steele was suspended and then tei___ninated as an FBI source for what the FBI defines \nas the most serious of violations—an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his \nrelationship with the FBI in an October 30, 2016, Mother Jones article by David \nCorn. Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with \nYahoo and other outlets in September—before the Page application was submitted to \nUNCLASSIFIE \n1//1 k_/1.\\_1`4 \nPROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n\fthe FISC in October—but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about \nthose contacts. \nb) Steele's numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source \nhandling—maintaining confidentiality—and demonstrated that Steele had become a \nless than reliable source for the FBI. \n3) Before and after Steele was terminated as a source, he maintained contact with DOJ via \nthen-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who worked \nclosely with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein. Shortly after the \nelection, the FBI began interviewing Ohr, documenting his communications with Steele. \nFor example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against then-\ncandidate Trump when Steele said he \"was desperate that Donald Trump not get \nelected and was passionate about him not being president.\" This clear evidence of \nSteele's bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in official FBI files___but \nnot reflected in any of the Page FISA applications. \na) During this same time period, Ohr's wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in \nthe cultivation of opposition research on Trump. Ohr later provided the FBI with all \nof his wife's opposition research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via \nFusion GPS. The Ohrs' relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably \nconcealed from the FISC. \n4) According to the head of the FBI's counterintelligence division, Assistant Director Bill \nPriestap, corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its \"infancy\" at the time of the initial \nPage FISA application. After Steele was terminated, a source validation report conducted \nby an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele's reporting as only minimally \ncorroborated. Yet, in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump \non a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was—according to his June 2017 \ntestimony—\"salacious and unverified.\" While the FISA application relied on Steele's \npast record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his \nanti-Trump financial and ideological motivations. Furthermore, Deputy Director \nMcCabe testified before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant \nwould have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information. \nASS', 'II \nIti*Erniffie \nPROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n\f5) The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign \nadvisor George Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy \nbetween Page and Papadopoulos. The Papadopoulos infoimation triggered the opening \nof an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok. \nStrzok was reassigned by the Special Counsel's Office to FBI Human Resources for \nimproper text messages with his mistress, FBI Attorney Lisa Page (no known relation to \nCarter Page), where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of \nClinton, whom Strzok had also investigated. The Strzok/Lisa Page texts also reflect \nextensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating leaks to the media, and \ninclude a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an \"insurance\" policy against \nPresident Trump's election. \nC S ATI I isTif.i+D \nTV) \\J__.1/11`4 \\-/1 k-J1 \nPROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n"
