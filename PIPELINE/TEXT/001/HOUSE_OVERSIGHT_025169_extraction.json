I have carefully monitored the web for articles about you and I have \nreason to think that those will persist indefinitely. I would be remiss as your friend if I did not encourage you \nto be as diligent and smart as possible in using tools like Signal, two-factor/multi-factor authentication, \ntaking webmail archives off the web onto your own secure privately maintained archive or deleted (unlike \nPodesta), and other measures. \n* publicity for your cool-ass creative and important philanthropy in support of really good and \nadventuresome, high-risk basic science research.
