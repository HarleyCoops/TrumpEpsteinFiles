Noseworthy, president and chief executive officer of the Mayo Clinic; Dr. Paul B.\nRothman, dean of the medical faculty, vice president for medicine of The Johns Hopkins University and chief\nexecutive officer of Johns Hopkins Medicine; Dr. Bruce Moskowitz; Dr. David F. Torchiana, president and\nchief executive officer of Partners HealthCare; and Dr. Toby Cosgrove, president and chief executive officer\nof the Cleveland Clinic.\nThe Cleveland Clinic has lots of patients, but a notable one is U.S. Rep. Tom Marino, R-10, Lycoming Twp.,\none of Mr. Trump’s top supporters, who has undergone kidney cancer surgery there.\nNone of the doctors gave to Mr. Trump’s campaign and generally don’t contribute much to political\ncampaigns if at all. When they do, they donate mostly to Democrats.\nMr. Trump is also meeting with Isaac Perlmutter, chief executive officer of Marvel Entertainment, and David\nM. Rubenstein the co-founder of Carlyle Group.\nMr. Perlumuter hardly ever gives to political campaigns either, but his wife, Laura, gave $2 million to former\npresidential candidate Marco Rubio’s campaign super PAC, according to The New York Times.\nMr. Rubenstein gives extensively to candidates from both parties.\nNeither he nor Perlmutter gave to Mr. Trump.\n– BORYS KRAWCZENIUK\nAuthor: borys Categories: Uncategorized Tags: Bruce Moskowitz, Cleveland Clinic, David F.

Bezos. (Bezos owns The\nWashington Post.)\nThe group talked about a wide range of topics, including bringing jobs back to\nthe United States, immigration, China, cybersecurity, taxes and technology in schools.\nWhat has been less publicized is that Trump has been holding similar meet-and-greets\nwith other titans of industry in critical areas of the economy, including finance\nand network news.\nOn Wednesday, his guests were health-care executives — many of whom represent\ncompanies or institutions that have a big stake in the outcome of Trump's ambitions to\ndismantle the Affordable Care Act. According to a pool report, the group, all men, met\nwith him at 11 a.m. at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. They included John\nNoseworthy of the Mayo Clinic, Paul Rothman of Johns Hopkins Medicine, David\nTorchiana of Partners HealthCare and Toby Cosgrove of the Cleveland Clinic.\nNoseworthy, a neurologist who is president and CEO of the Mayo Clinic, in recent\nyears has been an articulate commentator about health-care reform on TV shows such\nas MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” NBC's “Meet the Press,” and “Charlie Rose.” He has\nargued that Obamacare was basically an expansion of insurance coverage and did not\nemphasize patient health enough.\nIn an interview with The Washington Post in November, he said his office had already\nbeen in touch with Trump's transition team offering help.\n“We’re really talking about replace and repair, rather than repeal. But we haven’t seen\na full approach yet from the administration. Personally, this is me speaking. … We’re\nbasically optimistic we can create a better system together,” Noseworthy said.\nIn a statement issued by his office shortly after the meeting began, Noseworthy said\nthe invitation from Trump was to \"share his perspective on the future of healthcare\ndelivery, research and excellence\" and that he was \"pleased for the opportunity.\"\nRothman is chief executive of Johns Hopkins Medicine and several years ago found\nhimself in the awkward position of criticizing physician Ben Carson, who at the time\nwas head of pediatric neurology for the institution, after he made disparaging remarks\nabout same-sex marriage. Carson later apologized publicly for his “poorly chosen\nwords.” Carson, a onetime political rival of Trump's, has been tapped to lead\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nTorchiana is chief executive of Partners HealthCare, based in Massachusetts — a state\nthat has long been at the forefront of health-care reform. Partners operates two of the\nmost well-regarded hospitals in the world, Massachusetts General and Brigham and\nWomen's Hospital, which are affiliated with Harvard Medical School. But in recent\nmonths, Partners has been under fire from some policymakers because of what they\ndescribe as a large gap between what Partners charges and what other providers\ncharge.\nCosgrove, a heart surgeon and Vietnam veteran who is chief executive of the Cleveland\nClinic, may be a candidate for the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs,\naccording to Bloomberg News. . Cosgrove has met with Trump several other times. He's\non an advisory panel of 16 executives for the president-elect on jobs and the economy,\nhas been spotted in Trump Tower recently and was in Palm Beach meeting with\nTrump last week.\nCosgrove has criticized Obamacare and in September appeared on CNBC's “Squawk\nBox” saying that health-care providers are drowning in paperwork.\n“The number of quality metrics that we have to report to the government every year is\njust going up like crazy. We're now reporting well over 100 quality metrics on a regular\nbasis,” he said, describing regulation paperwork as coming in seven-foot-tall stacks of\n16,000 pages.\nAlso in the meeting were Bruce Moskowitz, described as a physician in Palm Beach,\nand Isaac Perlmutter, chief executive officer of Marvel Entertainment. We can't\nexplain what he was doing there.\nSeparately, former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson was expected to meet with\nTrump later in the day to discuss Obamacare reform, according to a pool report.\nThompson served as secretary of health and human services during George W. Bush's\nfirst term.\nThis post has been updated.\nRead more:\nTrump could quickly doom ACA cost-sharing subsidies for millions of Americans\nTrump turns to conservative tacticians to run HHS and Medicare, Medicaid\nTrump names Rep.
