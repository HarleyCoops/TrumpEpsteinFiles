People have told me some of his \nthoughts on background but I wanted to see if he could \ntell me or email me anything directly I could use on \nthe record. Also I'd like to run the information I \nalready have by you or him. \nThank you, \nAlexandra \n-What is he chiefly focusing on now? Is he spending \nmore time on The Jeffrey Epstein Science Foundation? \nCould he talk about his interest in science and the \n2011 grants/conference? \n-How has his business been affected? Is there any new \ndirection he's taking it? Does he still have the same \nclients or new ones? Is it still at $15 billion? \n-Did he still work while in prison? How was that \narranged? With whom was he working/advising? \n-Where is he spending his time now? How has his social \nlife changed from three years ago? \n-Is he still close with Ghislaine Maxwell? \n-What were friends/colleagues/acquaintances reactions \nto his conviction? \n-What does he think about the sentence he got- was it \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019409 \ntoo lenient or too harsh and why? \n-What is his side of the story and have people been \nsupportive? \n-Is he continuing the charity initiatives he started \nwith Bill Clinton, etc? \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Jay Lefkowitz [mailto: \nSent: Mon 3/7/2011 12:18 PM \nTo: Wolfe, Alexandra \nSubject: \nDear Ms. Wolfe, \nI understand you have some questions about my client, \nJeffrey Epstein.
