BROWN\nDECEMBER 19, 2018 8:30 PM, UPDATED DECEMBER 27, 2018 7:55 AM\nAccused sex traffickers Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell have settled a federal civil lawsuit\nfiled by a woman who says she was ordered under threat of violence to have sex with them and\nother influential individuals when she was in her early 20s, sources confirmed Wednesday.\nSarah Ransome, who now lives in Barcelona, claimed that she was recruited and trafficked for\nsex by the pair in 2006 and 2007 — at the same time that Epstein, a wealthy New York hedge\nfund manager, was under federal investigation for molesting dozens of underage girls at his\nPalm Beach mansion.\nWomen who say they were victims of sexual abuse at the hands of Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein\nwant a judge to throw out his lenient plea deal. AP\nAccording to a recent court transcript, among those people Ransome claims she was directed to\nhave sex with was Epstein’s lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, who helped negotiate a controversial plea\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article223315075.html\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-16 Filed 04/16/19 Page 3 of 6\ndeal that gave the eccentric multimillionaire — and co-conspirators employed by Epstein —\nfederal immunity in 2008.\nDershowitz, 80, told the Miami Herald that he has never met Ransome nor has he ever had sex\nwith her. He accused Ransome’s attorney, powerhouse lawyer David Boies, of inventing the\nstory and using her and another woman, Virginia Roberts, to frame him. Roberts asserted in a\nfederal court affidavit in 2015 that Epstein forced her to have sex with Dershowitz when she was\n16 years old.\n“I am the victim. David Boies and these women are the perpetrators,’’ Dershowitz said. “They\nhave willfully and deliberately concocted stories in order to make money — millions and\nmillions of dollars. And I will not rest until the entire story comes out,’’ said Dershowitz, a\nprofessor at Harvard Law School and frequent Fox news guest commentator.\nNowhere in the court case or the transcript does Ransome or anyone else allege that Ransome\nhad sex with Dershowitz — only that she was directed to.\nThe Ransome settlement, which is confidential, comes two weeks after Epstein settled another\nlawsuit in Palm Beach, filed by an attorney who represented several women who said they were\ncoerced into sex acts with Epstein when they were underage. As part of the settlement, Epstein,\n65, issued an apology to Fort Lauderdale attorney Bradley Edwards, admitting that he leveled\nfalse claims in a lawsuit as part of an effort to intimidate Edwards into abandoning his\naggressive advocacy for the women, who are now in their late 20s and early 30s.\nThe developments follow a series of stories published by the Miami Herald in late November\nthat detailed how state and federal prosecutors worked with Epstein’s lawyers to conceal the\nextent of Epstein’s crimes, and secretly negotiated an unusual plea agreement that allowed him\nto escape federal sex trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life. The\nagreement, by design, was kept from his victims so that they could not appear at his sentencing.\nLast week, more than two dozen lawmakers in Washington demanded a federal investigation\ninto that plea deal, which was negotiated, signed and sealed by former Miami U.S. Attorney\nAlexander Acosta, now President Donald Trump’s secretary of labor.\nAcosta has not commented on the Herald story or on the calls\nfor a probe into how he handled the Epstein case.\nThis week, a decade after defending Epstein, Dershowitz once\nagain found himself in the spotlight amid the new allegations,\nmentioned briefly in a court filing on Nov. 28, and first\nreported on Tuesday by the New York Daily News.\nDuring a Nov. 7 hearing, Maxwell’s lawyer, Laura Menninger,\nmentioned Dershowitz’s name as among those “third parties’’\nthat Ransome claims she was instructed to have sex with,\naccording to a transcript of the hearing obtained by the Herald.\nOn Tuesday, after the Daily News published its story,\nDershowitz lashed out in dozens of posts on Twitter,\ndenouncing Ransome as “delusional’’ and claiming that her\nlawyer, Boies, was retaliating against him because Dershowitz\nhad filed a bar complaint against him.\nAlan Dershowitz says he has never met\nthe woman who alleges in a lawsuit she\nwas ordered to have sex with influential\nmen, including the famous lawyer. John\nLamparski GETTY IMAGES/TNS\n“Attorney David Boies threatened that unless I withdrew a bar\ncomplaint I had filed against him for falsely accusing me of\nsexual misconduct, he would find another woman to accuse me of similar misconduct. He has\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article223315075.html\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-16 Filed 04/16/19 Page 4 of 6\nnow found an unbalanced woman who has delusions of having sex tapes of Donald Trump,\nHillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and other prominent figures,’’ Dershowitz said in a tweet.\nBoies, best known for arguing on behalf of Vice President Al Gore in the 2000 Florida election\nrecount, responded in an interview with the Herald:\n“[Dershowitz’s] charges are absurd. Either he has become totally unhinged or he thinks that if\nhe says things that are loud enough and crazy enough it will distract attention from what he has\ndone. There is no support — none — for what he says.’’\nRansome claimed that, in her early 20s, she was recruited to work as a masseuse for Epstein\nwho, in exchange, promised he would help her get into fashion design in New York, according to\nher civil lawsuit, filed in January 2017. Epstein and Maxwell then kept her passport and\nthreatened to ruin her life and physically harm her if she didn’t have sex with them and others\nin 2006 and 2007, Ransome said in the complaint.\nThe complaint alleges that this all occurred at the same time as Epstein’s lawyers were\nnegotiating with Acosta and other federal prosecutors for a deal to avoid federal sex trafficking\ncharges in connection with a scheme in which he lured underprivileged girls, mostly 13 to 16, to\nhis home in Palm Beach under the pretense that he would pay them $200 to $300 for massages.\nInstead, police in Palm Beach found that he had been molesting and sexually abusing dozens of\ngirls between 2001 and 2007.\nIn this photograph, Virginia Roberts socializes with Prince Andrew as Jeffrey\nEpstein associate Guislaine Maxwell stands in the background. Roberts claims she\nwas effectively used as a sex slave by Epstein. In that capacity she had sex with\nthe prince, Roberts says. The prince denied that. COURTESY OF VIRGINIA ROBERTS\nUnder the plea deal, known as a non-prosecution agreement, Epstein was allowed to plead\nguilty in state court to two prostitution charges. He served 13 months in a private wing of the\nPalm Beach County jail, where he was given liberal work release privileges. The deal also\nquashed an FBI investigation into whether Epstein was operating an international sex\ntrafficking organization, the Herald found as part of its yearlong investigation.\n“Even as [Epstein, Maxwell and other defendants] and their attorneys were busy arguing\nEpstein’s innocence and publicly defaming his victims as liars...defendants merely changed\ntheir location’’ from Palm Beach to “other places in the U.S. [including the Southern District of\nNew York] and abroad and brought them to Epstein’s mansion in New York City and his private\nisland in the Virgin Islands,’’ Ransome’s complaint alleged.\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article223315075.html\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-16 Filed 04/16/19 Page 5 of 6\nDershowitz, in interviews with the Herald, and in recent public statements, said he has never\nmet Ransome. He also said she initially tried to interest the New York Post in her story, but a\nreporter whom he said he spoke with told him Ransome was not credible. He said he has a trove\nof emails between Ransome and the reporter that prove she is a “lunatic.’’\n“There are hundreds of emails in which she claimed to have sex with everybody in the world and\nalso claimed she has video of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and others having sex\nwith underage girls — but she never ever accused me in these emails,’’ Dershowitz said.\nThe emails are under seal, he said, and therefore cannot be made public. Dershowitz said he has\nasked the court to unseal them but his efforts thus far have been unsuccessful.\nIn the recent court transcript, however, it is Maxwell’s attorney, Laura Menninger — not\nRansome or her attorneys — who named Dershowitz.\n“[Ransome] has alleged not only that my client [Maxwell] ran a sex trafficking organization but\nshe claims also that she was directed by my client and the Epstein defendants to have sex with\nthird parties, including Alan Dershowitz, for example,’’ Menninger said. “And so to the extent\nmy client or Mr. Dershowitz or anyone else is going to be asked about their private sexual\nactivity, I believe that would implicate their privacy rights...’’\nRoberts, who now lives in Australia, said that Epstein ordered her to have sex with Dershowitz\nsix times, according to a 2015 affidavit, which was filed in connection with an unrelated Epstein\nfederal lawsuit.\nAt that time, Dershowitz launched a media blitz on TV asserting that Roberts made up the story.\nHe also called for Roberts’ lawyers — Edwards and University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell\n— to be disbarred. The lawyers sued Dershowitz for defamation, and the case was settled last\nyear.\nDershowitz publicly declared he was vindicated after a federal judge ordered Roberts’ affidavit\nstricken from the court record. But the judge did not address the veracity of her sexual\nmisconduct claims; he instead ruled that the affidavit was misplaced in a case not involving\nDershowitz.\nBoies, whose firm represented Roberts pro bono, addressed Dershowitz’s longstanding\ncontention that he had been exonerated.\n“Anytime in a lawsuit where you were the defendant and you paid the plaintiff $900,000 to\nsettle it — that’s a strange kind of vindication,’’ Boies said, asserting that Dershowitz paid that\namount as part of the defamation settlement with Edwards and Cassell.\nIn 2016, Dershowitz released a statement following what he said was “an independent\ninvestigation’’ that had been conducted by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who is now a\nprivate consultant.\n“Our investigation found no evidence to support the accusations of sexual misconduct against\nProfessor Dershowitz. In fact, in several instances, the evidence directly contradicted the\naccusations made against him,’’ Freeh wrote.\nMost of the court records in the Roberts case are sealed. In February, the Miami Herald filed a\nmotion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents. The motion, which\nwas not opposed by Roberts, could shed more light on the full scope of Epstein’s crimes and\nwho was involved.\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article223315075.html\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-16 Filed 04/16/19 Page 6 of 6\nThe motion was denied. The Herald is appealing.\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article223315075.html\n"
