As of now it looks \nlike former Chairman of Armed Services, Congressman Ron Dellums, will be the author. Please keep highly \nconfidential. Will keep you posted on if, when and where it gets published. Once it is published we can all circulate it \nhighly. We believe that this article sets the tone for the advocacy we will be doing and having someone very prominent \nlike Congressman Dellums will also be a great way to launch this campaign. \nCongressman Ronald Dellums is a thirteen term Member of the U.S. House of Representatives (D-CA) who \nserved from 1971-1998. He also served as the 48th Mayor of Oakland from 2007-2011. Dellums served as the \nChairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on the District of Columbia. He \nalso served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence and co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026836 \nSenegal's Democratic Backslide \n2015 was a banner year for democracy in Africa. Nigeria, the largest country on the continent, had a \ndemocratic election, and even more impressively, had its first ever peaceful transition of power when sitting \nPresident Goodluck Jonathan transferred power to Muhammadu Buhari. Former President Jonathan conceded \nand famously declared, \"Nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian.\" My last piece for The Hill \nwas titled, 'Will Guinea's experiment in democracy succeed?\" It is with great joy that I can report that it \ndid! Guinea's first democratically elected President, Alpha Conde, won his reelection campaign in a peaceful \nelection that was internationally monitored in which the Guinean electorate reaffirmed its commitment to a \ndemocracy. \nDespite these victories for democracy in a continent in which I dedicated a great deal of my life's work, I am \ndeeply troubled by developments over the last few weeks. Earlier this week Uganda President Yoweri \nMuseveni extended his thirty year rule and \"won\" his fifth consecutive election which international observers \nsaid was marred with intimidation and impropriety. Shortly after the election Museveni, who scrapped \nconstitutional term limits a decade ago, had his political rival, Kizza Besigye arrested and detained for \nprotesting the election results. Of course we have come to expect these actions from Museveni in \nUganda. What I am even most troubled by is what is taking place in Senegal, which was once the pillar of \ndemocracy in Africa. \nWhen Abdoulaye Wade was democratically elected as President of Senegal in 2000, it was a huge step \nforward for democracy in Africa. President Wade adopted a new constitution and instituted term limits for the \nfirst time in Senegalese history. In 2012 President Wade was defeated in a democratic election by his Prime \nMinister Macky Sall. The United States and the larger international community praised Wade for his quick \nconcession and praised peaceful transition of power. President Macky Sall affirmed his commitment to \ndemocracy announcing that he would shorten term limits from 7 to 5 years. President Obama visited Senegal in \nJune of 2013 and praised President Sall for his commitment to democracy in shortening the presidential \nmandate and praised the country's rule of law. \nUnfortunately in the past few years much has changed and we are witnessing a backslide in what was once \nAfrica's brightest democratic success story. When the opposition party, the Senegalese Democratic Party, \ndesignated former President Abdoulaye Wade' son, former Minister Karim Wade, as their candidate for the next \npresidential election; President Sall had Karim Wade arrested and detained. President Macky Sall then \nreestablished a special court by presidential decree that had been abolished by Senegalese law and not heard a \ncase in thirty years. This newly established special court sentenced Mr. Wade to six years in prison. He remains \nin prison today, sentenced without appeal. In April 2015, the United Nations Working Group of Arbitrary \nDetention determined that Mr. Wade was arbitrarily arrested and that his detention was in violation of \ninternational law. Last month the UN Working Group reaffirmed its finding and called on President Sall's \nregime to release Karim Wade and comply with international law. Sall has ignored the UN Working Groups \nrequest. \nLast week the backslide continued even further as President Macky Sall reneged on his commitment to shorten \nterm limits. Instead of holding elections next year, after five years per his commitment, he announced that he \nwould serve until 2019. He claims that this decision was based on the opinion - just an opinion - of the \nConstitutional Council that he had himself sought. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026837 \nIn light of the trend toward democracy in Africa as exemplified by Nigeria and Guinea, it is very concerning \nthat one of the United States' closest allies and Africa's strongest democracies appears to be retrogressing. The \ndestabilization of democracy in Senegal could have significant consequences in the entire region. The United \nStates must get in front of this negative trend before spreads across Africa and it is too late. The U.S. should \ncall for President Sall to honor the request of the UN Working Group and release his political rival Mr. Wade \nand also keep his pledge of a 5 year presidential mandate. President Obama has said that Africa is more \nimportant than ever to security and prosperity in the U.S. We have worked very hard in implementing and \nprioritizing democracy and democratic succession in Africa. The Obama administration must not let our hard \nwork be compromised in Senegal, we have worked too hard and come too far. \n<image001.gif> \nVinoda Basnayake \nOf Counsel and Chair of DC Government Relations \nNelson Mullins Riley a Scarborough LLP \n101 Constitution Avenue, NW, Suite 900 \nWashington, DC 20001 \nTel: \nFax: \nwww.nelsonmullins.com \n(View Bio) \nFrom: elisabeth feliho [mailto \nSent: Tuesday, February 23, 2016 5:20 AM \nTo: Vinoda Basnayake; Bob Crowe \nCc: Cheikh Tidiane Sy; Mohamed Seydou Diagne; El Hadji Amadou Sall \nSubject: Revised letter.
