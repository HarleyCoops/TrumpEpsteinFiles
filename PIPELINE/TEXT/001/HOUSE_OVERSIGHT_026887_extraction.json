Well,\nlet's get more on that story now.\nWe're joined from Beijing by\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn who\nadvises China's leaders and\nmultinational corporations. He's\nalso the author of \"How China's\nLeaders Think\". How do they\nthink about this? It's difficult to\nknow where this might end.\nRLK: Let's look at what just\nhappened. China retaliated with\n$60 billion worth of U.S. goods\nthat it was putting tariffs on, but\nhalf of it was five percent, half\nwas 10 percent, which is less\nthan the American side, which\nwas 10 percent on all. And the\n$60 billion is proportional in the\nsense that it is about 40 percent\nof the total US exports to China.\nJust as the $200 billion was\nabout 40 percent of the little bit\nmore than $500 billion that\nChina exports to the US. So\nthat's the proportionality.\nRLK: There's a lot of talk there\nmight have been more\ncountermeasures like selling\ntreasury bonds or disrupting\nAmerican companies. That hasn't\noccurred yet. China is sending\nsignals that it's ratcheting down\nthe escalation, not trying to\nescalate it. China has to\nrespond. The government of\nChina, the Communist Party of\nChina, the leading Party, the\nruling party here, has two big\nfacets that justifies its\nlegitimacy.\nRLK: One is the economic\ngrowth. This is the 40th\nanniversary of reform and\nopening up — China's economic\nmiracle. Increasing GDP per\ncapita is almost 50 times,\nmaking the standards of living of\nthe vast majority of people quite\ndecent. Second area is national\nrejuvenation, national pride. And\nso the trade war affects both.\nYou have economics, and the\npride: the economics, the tariffs,\nare certainly suboptimal in all\nrespects for all countries, but\nChina must respond because it\nhas to maintain the dignity of\nthe country, but it does so in a\nway to signal that it wants this\nto resolve.\nRLK: It won't resolve soon. No\none expects it before the midterm\nelections. But it's very\nimportant to understand from\nthe US point of view what the\nreal issues are and where we\nseek the solution.\nHOST: What are the real issues?\nRLK: There are five real issues\nand I do not include the trade\ndeficit — because, obviously the\ntrade deficit is complicated. You\nhave components coming from\nother countries that is counted\nas part of the trade deficit, but\nChina gets no benefit from them.\nAn iPhone for example. Maybe,\nChina gets 6 or 10 percent of the\ncost of roughly $350 for a $1000\nretail price. China has also\nservice purchases that's not\nincluded in the trade deficit,\nsomething like $40 billion per\nyear — tourists, students.\nRLK: But there are five big\nissues that are really critical.\nOpening up of China's markets\nwhich have been closed. They're\nmaking some progress, not\nenough. Intellectual property:\nthis is an area that China really\nhas made substantial progress.\nAgain, not enough, need to do\nmore, but they've made\nsubstantial progress. This is\naffecting Chinese companies and\nChina knows it needs to improve\nIP protection.\nRLK: Third is industrial\nespionage, a very sensitive area.\nCyber theft: China has decreased\nit. It's a complicated area. It\nneeds to do more. Hard to know\nwhat the government does and\ndoesn't do, but everybody knows\nthat's looked at.\nRLK: Fourth is technology\ntransfer. And then government\nsupport of new technologies.\nThe last is the most sensitive\none.\nHOST: Robert Lawrence Kuhn,\nwe’re going to have to leave it\nthere. Lots to talk about. We do\nappreciate your time.\n"
