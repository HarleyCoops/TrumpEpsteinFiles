However, the history\nof the ancient Silk Road has fed our imagination\nfor centuries. Today, China speaks for reality\nwhile Europe is limiting itself to curiosity. But newly\nelected French President Emmanuel Macron can accelerate\nEurope’s interest in the initiative.\nPresident Xi Jinping surprised the rest of the world\nwhen he announced the Belt and Road Initiative. As\noften happens in China, the idea is the result of a deep\nstrategic reflection.\nChina is seeking big markets for its industrial products.\nMarginal gains of globalization are shrinking,\nand growth needs a new revival. In Asia, this new\nrevival is called connectivity. By helping the economies\nalong the Belt and Road routes to develop and\nimprove their infrastructure, hard and soft, China is\nreinforcing its openness and the upgrading of its\nmanufacturing sector.\nThe initiative will also help the internationalization\nof its currency and, in the long run, the transformation\nof its growth toward quality.\nEurope should find interest in this. Under the initiative,\ncooperation with China on its two aisles, Eurasia\nand “Eurafrica”, can allow the European Union to\nreach its economic growth and employment targets.\nThat big geostrategic region must become “a community\nof interests, of responsibility and common fate”.\nAs Premier Li Keqiang has often said, “today, no\nnation can succeed alone”. Therefore we must invent\ninternational engaging projects. This perspective is\ndefinitely pacifist. And by serving development and\nprosperity, it serves peace.\nChina’s analysis needs to be studied. In the past, the East\nwas the place where goods were born, and the West where\nthey matured. Today, the West is standing still or even\ngoing backward while the East initiates reforms.\nAsian dynamics must reach Europe. As a country of\nnew technologies, France is ready. Its interest is even\nmore relevant since the United States has become\nmore unpredictable and is turning toward the Asia-Pacific\nregion while ignoring Europe.\nEurasia is the future global balancing power. In the\ninitiative, Europe can find a historical opportunity to\nput itself into a more central world position. So, is this\nthe time to redefine transatlantic relations?\nFor China, the West-led globalization has created\nharsh competitions, partly destructive. It points to civilizations\nmoving backward, for example, by giving rise\nto populism in the West and Brexit. That is why the\nelection of Macron as French president sends a message\nof trust and hope.\nEurasia, marked by great civilizations such as Egyptian,\nBabylonian, Greek, Indian and Chinese, can be\nthe place of rebirth of civilization. And oceans must\nagain find a place in this civilization.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative, like other innovative\n21st century ideas, is not speculative or virtual. Huge\nfinancial means and multilateral tools have been\ninvested to give shape to the initiative, which will\nreform global governance.\nThe Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank will\ndefinitely leverage growth for Eurasian economies.\nAnd the initiative, BRICS New Development Bank and\nthe Silk Road Fund all show that China has the power\nto realize its vision.\nIn the next five years, China will import $10 trillion\nworth of goods and invest more than $500 billion\nabroad. The current pace is faster than the 13th Five-\nYear Plan (2016-20) forecast. For the first time this year,\nChinese investments abroad have exceeded foreign\ninvestments in China.\nFrance is following the initiative with interest, and\nmust realize that it directly touches its interests and\nalliances. This is a great opportunity for the new\nFrench president.\nBy choosing a message of openness, the French people\nhave shown they are open to great adventures that\nserve development, hence peace.\nJean Pierre Raffarin is former prime minister of\nFrance and president of the Senate’s Foreign Affairs,\nMilitary and Defense Commission, and Xu Gai is his\nadvisor on China affairs.\nCONTACT US\nChina Daily\n15 Huixin Dongjie Chaoyang, Beijing 100029\nNews: +86 (0) 10 6491-8366;\neditor@chinadaily.com.cn\nSubscription: +86 400-699-0203;\nsubscribe@chinadaily.com.cn\nAdvertisement: +86 (0) 10 6491-8631;\nads@chinadaily.com.cn\nPhone app: chinadaily.com.cn/iphone\nChina Daily USA\n1500 Broadway, Suite 2800, New\nYork, NY 10036 +1 212 537 8888\neditor@chinadailyusa.com\nChina Daily Asia Pacific\nChina Daily Hong Kong\nRoom 1818, Hing Wai Centre 7 Tin Wan Praya Road Aberdeen, Hong\nKong\n+852 2518 5111\neditor@chinadailyhk.com\neditor@chinadailyasia.com\nChina Daily UK\n90 Cannon Street London EC4N 6HA\n+44 (0) 207 398 8270\neditor@chinadailyuk.com\nChina Daily Africa\nP.O.Box 27281-00100, Nairobi, Kenya\n+254 (0) 20 522 3498 (Nairobi)\neditor@chinadailyafrica.com\nenquiries@chinadailyafrica.com\nsubscription@chinadailyafrica.com\nYang Yanyi\nTogether we can make a difference\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn\nInitiative marks transition of grand vision\nThe Belt and Road\nForum for International\nCooperation\nmarks a transition of\nhigh symbolism in President\nXi Jinping’s grand vision for a\nnew era of win-win globalization.\nThe core idea is to structure,\nfinance and build critical\ninfrastructure in developing\neconomies, as well as diversify\nand expand the Chinese economy,\nwhich needs restructuring.\nThis is the fourth Belt and\nRoad forum I will attend.\nXi announced the Silk Road\nEconomic Belt as a “grand\ncause benefiting people in\nregional countries along the\nancient route” in Kazakhstan in\nSeptember 2013. In June 2014, I was\nasked to articulate the vision at the first\nBelt and Road forum in Urumqi, Northwest\nChina’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous\nregion. I described five categories:\nhistory, culture, trade, mutual development\nand peaceful development.\nThe second forum was in Quanzhou,\nSoutheast China’s Fujian province, in\nFebruary 2015. It enlarged the vision to\ninclude the 21st Century Maritime Silk\nRoad, engaging Southeast Asia, South\nAsia, the Middle East and East Africa.\nThe third forum was held in Xi’an,\nNorthwest China’s Shaanxi province, in\nSeptember 2016, with the theme “Shared\nMemory, Common Development”.\nTo comprehend Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative,\none must appreciate globalization,\nwhich is founded on the perennial\nlaw of comparative economic advantage\nSultan Ahmed Al Jaber\nbut which is suffering discontent due to\nits differential impact on workers in\nWestern countries. In a reversal of historic\nproportions, China now champions\nglobalization, while the United States is\nnow conflicted with “America First” protectionism.\nChina’s developmental miracle is\nfounded on globalization, as Chinese\nworkers made China the low-cost manufacturing\ncenter of the world.\nBut China’s old model no longer works\n— for one, workers must be paid higher\nsalaries to rebalance severe socio-economic\nimbalances. China must develop\nnew modes of globalization, leveraging\nits expertise and experience, especially in\ninfrastructure construction, which is just\nwhat the developing economies need for\ntheir development.\nThe initiative is to expand links\nbetween Asia, Africa and Europe, and\nthus reduce imbalances in national\ndevelopment and promote global economic\ngrowth. It focuses on projects such\nas high-speed railways. Development\ncomes first, China believes; nothing good\ncan happen without economic growth.\nThe Beijing forum seeks consensus on\nmajor cross-regional projects, especially\nnetworks of roads, railways and shipping.\nAt the Xi’an forum, I chaired a session\n(on the media), which was held at precisely\nthe same time as the first debate\nbetween US presidential candidates\nDonald Trump and Hillary\nClinton.\n“One hundred years from\ntoday,” I began, “when the history\nof our times is written, our forum\non the Belt and Road (Initiative)\nwill carry more significance than\nthe Trump-Clinton debate.”\nI was joking in one sense, but\nnot in another. Why is the initiative\nso significant?\nFrom the global perspective,\npoverty, under-development, and\nvast inequalities are deep, seemingly\nintractable problems — and\neconomic development, catalyzed\nby infrastructure construction,\nis an essential part of the\nsolutions.\nFrom China’s perspective, after\ndecades of remarkable growth, economic\ntransformation is necessary, and\nthis includes geographical rebalancing\nwithin China and expanding China’s\ntrade by enhancing globalization.\nAll of these can be achieved by the initiative,\nbut only if formulated synergistically\nand implemented assiduously.\nThere are substantial challenges, of\ncourse — economic, financial, structural,\npolitical instability, nationalism, terrorism\nand, in certain circles, suspicion of\nChina’s motives.\nBut for sure, the world has great need\nand China has a grand plan in the Belt\nand Road Initiative.\nThe author is a public intellectual, political/economics\ncommentator, and international\ncorporate strategist.\nBuilding a bridge to our common future\nThe Belt and Road Forum for\nInternational Cooperation to\nbe held in Beijing on Sunday\nand Monday will see the participation\nof some 1,500 officials, scholars,\nentrepreneurs from more than 130\ncountries, and representatives from more\nthan 70 international organizations. Of\nthe 29 heads of state and government\nwho will participate in the forum, quite a\nfew are from Europe. European Commission\nVice-President Jyrki Katainen, too,\nwill take part in the forum.\nAt a time when the global economic\nrecovery is still sluggish, trade and investment\nremains weak, and growth impetus\nunstable, the forum offers an excellent\nopportunity to review the gains and,\nmore importantly, to build a closer and\nstronger partnership.\nChina and the European Union share\nmuch in common in pursuing shared\ngrowth, development and connectivity,\nincluding through the Belt and Road Initiative,\nand have come up with a proud\nrecord so far.\nAt the 17th China-EU Summit in 2015,\nChina and the EU agreed to synergize the\ninitiative and the Investment Plan for\nEurope. China and some EU countries\nhave signed inter-governmental cooperation\nagreements and launched a Belt and\nRoad working group mechanism to jointly\nadvance the initiative. Also, China and\n16 Central and Eastern European countries\nhave worked closely to enhance\ncooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative\nand the 16+1 framework.\nAs concrete steps to promote seamless\ntraffic flows, China and the EU signed an\nMOU for the establishment of a “Connectivity\nPlatform”. China has launched railway\nfreight service to some European\ncountries. And cooperation in such areas\nas railways, ports, airports, power, transportation\nand logistics has gathered\nmomentum.\nThe two sides are also working\ntogether to deepen dialogue and cooperation\nin information and communications\ntechnology.\nTo develop practical financial avenues\nfor mutually beneficial cooperation, China\nand the EU agreed to set up a co-investment\nfund. And early this year,\nChina became the 67th member of the\nEuropean Bank of Reconstruction and\nDevelopment.\nThe Beijing forum has now raised the\ntwo sides’ interest in exploring potential\nareas of cooperation to create fresh energy\nfor pursuing interconnected development.\nTo contribute to the ongoing\nefforts and deliberations, here are my\nsuggestions.\nFirst, the Belt and Road Initiative is\nThe Belt and Road Forum for\nInternational Cooperation in\nBeijing is a milestone in the\ndevelopment of China’s Belt\nand Road Initiative, a historic effort to\ntransform the economies along the two\nroutes, strengthen links between them\nand better connect them to the rest of\nthe world. The United Arab Emirates\nstrongly supports the initiative, which\nwill foster economic growth and security\nboth regionally and globally.\nSubstantial progress has been made\nsince President Xi Jinping announced\nthe initiative in 2013. During this period,\nChina has directly invested more than\n$50 billion and helped establish the\nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank —\na new multilateral institution designed\nto finance vital public works in Asia’s\nemerging economies. The UAE is a\nfounding member of the AIIB and committed\nto its central mission of bringing\nthe Belt and Road Initiative vision to life.\nChina’s approach to economic development\nmirrors our own. We share the\nsame core beliefs in the essential connection\nbetween trade, peace and prosperity.\nFor both our peoples, these beliefs\ngo beyond stated principles to concrete\nactions, best expressed by the strength\nof our bilateral trade, which has grown\ndramatically — almost 800 times, in the\nthree decades since we established formal\nrelations — from $63 million in\n1984 to more than $50 billion in 2016.\nOur cultural and economic ties with\nChina go back centuries. But today’s\ntrade spans multiple sectors, with one of\nthe most important being energy.\nRecognizing that energy demand in\nthe economies along the Belt and Road\nroutes will grow by 50 percent by 2040,\nboth China and the UAE have made strategic\nco-investment in this sector. China\nNational Petroleum Corp and China\nEnergy recently took a minority share in\nthe UAE’s onshore oil reserves, beginning\na partnership with the Abu Dhabi\nNational Oil Company that will secure oil\nLI MIN / CHINA DAILY\nsupplies for decades and ease market\naccess for essential and higher value\nproducts throughout the region.\nADNOC’s petrochemical company,\nBorouge, is celebrating seven years of\noperations in China during which the\ntrading volume has quadrupled. Borouge\nis gearing up for market growth\nboth within China and in the economies\nalong the Belt and Road routes, where\ndemand for petrochemicals and plastic,\nincluding essential utility piping and\ncable insulation, is expected to more\nthan double by 2040.\nAt the pivot point between Asia,\nEurope and Africa, the UAE is ideally\nlocated as a logistical hub that can facilitate\ntrade to and from the economies\nalong the Belt and Road routes. DP\nWorld’s Jebel Ali Port is the largest in the\nMiddle East and Abu Dhabi Ports Company\nis one of the fastest growing. Last\nyear, Abu Dhabi Ports Company partnered\nwith China’s shipping giant COS-\nCO to build a new terminal at Khalifa\nguided by the spirit of openness and\nconstructive cooperation. Given the rising\nprotectionist and anti-globalization\nsentiments in many parts of the world,\nit is in our interest that China and the\nEU stay committed to free trade and\neconomic openness, a rules-based,\ntransparent and fair international trading\nregime and order, and open up markets,\noppose protectionism and secure\ngreater connectivity and economic\ndevelopment and prosperity.\nSecond, the initiative is a win-win formula.\nThe notion that this project is\ndesigned to enable China to access new\nmarkets, which will pose a challenge,\neven “threat”, to the future of Europe is\nwrong, as it neglects the fresh perspectives\nit will bring to European integration.\nBeing open, transparent, harmonious and\ninclusive, the initiative is an invitation to\nall economies along the Belt and Road\nroutes to build synergies between their\ndevelopment strategies and the initiative,\nexplore cooperation, and share the benefits\nof the projects.\nThird, it is time that China and the\nEU capitalized on the new opportunities\noffered by the initiative. Among others,\nChina wishes to broaden policy\ncoordination and advance cooperation\nconsensus through an institutionalized\ndialogue mechanism, more closely collaborate\non concrete projects within the\nChina-EU Connectivity Platform, work\nclosely to explore ways and means of\njoint financing and initiating projects,\nand deepen China-EU legal affairs dialogue\nwith a view to creating a favorable\nenvironment for business.\nWe are more than ready to add new\ndimensions to our cooperation with the\nEU. For instance, given that China is\ntransforming its economic development\nmodel based on innovation, and innovation\nremains essential to European integration,\nwe should make deepening\ncooperation in science and technology\nand innovation our top priority.\nAnd fourth, we hope that at the Beijing\nforum and the 19th China-EU Summit,\nChina and the EU will send out this\npositive message: as the two parties\nvital to the maintenance of world peace\nand promotion of common development\nand shared destiny, China and the\nEU will shoulder the shared responsibility\nof promoting the construction of a\nmore fair, reasonable and balanced\nglobal governance system based on\nopenness, inclusiveness and win-win\ncooperation, and that together we can\nmake a difference.\nThe author is the head of the Chinese\nMission to the European Union.\nPort that will double cargo capacity, further\nexpanding the flow of commerce\namong the economies along the Belt\nand Road routes and the world’s other\nmajor trading blocs. As many economies\nalong the two routes look to extend their\nfootprint in Africa, the UAE represents a\nnatural nexus for developing mutually\nbeneficial trading links.\nThe 65 economies along the two routes\naccount for 30 percent of global GDP. By\n2040, they will account for almost twothirds,\nthereby becoming the world’s\nmost significant driver of economic\ngrowth. Making the right investments\nnow will ensure this growth remains sustainable\nand more evenly spread.\nIn short, the success of the Belt and\nRoad Initiative can provide the foundation\nfor a more secure, prosperous and\nprogressive future for the world.\nThe author is a minister of state in the\nUnited Arab Emirates and ADNOC\nGroup CEO.\n"
