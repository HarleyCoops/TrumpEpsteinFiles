Kennedy, listed for sale about 90 acres \nof land in Martha's Vineyard, a resort island off the Massachusetts coast. \nTwo waterfront parcels in the town of Aquinnah are on the market -- a 39.5-acre (16-hectare) property available \nfor $20 million, and a 53.5-acre piece for $25 million, according to the listings for 6 Red Gate Farm and 8 Red \nGate Farm. \n\"An exclusive waterfront property with incredible views of Squibnocket Pond, with further views over towering \nsand dunes to the Atlantic Ocean,\" the listing for 6 Red Gate Farm reads. \"Plenty of privacy with varied \ntopography and easy pond access. Yours to create a marvelous estate.\" \nThe land is part of a 366-acre stretch that has been private since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis bought it in 1978, \nsaid John O'Connell, broker and owner of Vineyard Realty Group in Edgartown, Massachusetts. \nThe property is \"a piece of the island that very few people have seen,\" said O'Connell, who isn't involved in the \nsale. \nCorporate records for Red Gate Farm LLC, which owns the land, lists Edwin A. Schlossberg as the person \nresponsible for the parcels. He is the husband of Caroline Kennedy, who is expected to be Obama's choice as \nthe next U.S. ambassador to Japan. \nTo contact the reporter on this story: Prashant Gopal in Boston at___________________________ \nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kara Wetzel at \nFind out more about Bloomberg for iPad: http://m.bloomberg.com/ipad/  \nSent from my iPad \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025591 \n"
