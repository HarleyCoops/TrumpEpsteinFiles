The tax changes\nmay come in two parts: (1) from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and its related taxes and (2)\nfrom comprehensive tax reform. Since Republicans will also have majorities 1 in both the House and Senate, it is\nanticipated that such changes could be undertaken without the need for bipartisan support. It is likely that the\nAffordable Care Act, and its taxes, could be repealed in early 2017 and result in an immediate tax cut for dividends,\ncapital gains and high‐income earners. It is more time consuming to enact comprehensive tax reform and such\nefforts may not result in a tax bill until midsummer\nor the fall, which could push the\neffective date of broad‐based tax changes into\n2018. Although it is not yet known exactly\nwhat the changes will be or when they would\nbe effective, we are issuing this Tax Alert to\ninform you of changes that are anticipated,\nbased on proposals made during the campaign\nby both President‐elect Trump and the House\nRepublicans. We also discuss how these\nchanges may impact your planning, both\ncurrently and in the future. When we have\nmore specifics, we expect to issue another Tax\nAlert.\nINCOME TAX\nCurrent law. Ordinary income can be subject\nto rates as high as 39.6%, and capital gain can\nbe subject to rates as high as 20%. In both\ncases, an additional 3.8% surtax might apply.\nCertain itemized deductions are “phased out”\nunder the so‐called “Pease limitation” when\nIndividual\nTax Rates\nTop Capital\nGains/Dividend\nTax Rate\nItemized\nDeductions\nAMT\nInvestment\nSurtax\nEstate Tax\nCurrent Law*\n10, 15, 25, 28,\n33, 35, 39.6%\n20%\n(plus 3.8%\nsurtax)\n3% of itemized\ndeductions are\nlost when adj.\ngross income\nexceeds\n$313,800\n($261,500 if\nsingle)\nParallel tax\ncalculation\nTrump Plan\nHouse GOP\nPlan\n12, 25, 33% 12, 25, 33%\n20% 16.5%\nLimited to\n$200,000\n(couples);\n$100,000\n(singles)\nEliminates\nEliminates\nexcept for\ncharitable and\n(likely capped\nand modified)\nmortgage\ninterest\nEliminates\n3.8% Eliminates Eliminates\n40% rate,\n$5,490,000\nexemption\n*Inflation adjusted amounts for 2017\nEliminates\n(capital gain at\ndeath subject to\n$10 million\nexemption)\nEliminates\nadjusted gross income reaches certain thresholds. The Alternative Minimum Tax can result in additional tax\nliability. The income from so‐called “carried interests” is taxed as capital gain.\n1\nIn the House of Representatives, a simple majority is sufficient to pass legislation. It is more complicated in the Senate,\nwhere 60 votes (a super majority) are required to avoid a filibuster. Republicans have a simple majority, but not a super\nmajority, in the Senate. However, there is a budget procedure known as Reconciliation, which allows certain legislation to\nbe passed without filibuster. Accordingly, it would appear that Republicans could pass tax legislation in the Senate with just\na simple majority.\nTAX ALERT 2016‐5: THE 2016 ELECTION: TAX CHANGES EXPECTED\nProposals. Both President‐elect Trump and the House Republicans would lower the top tax rate for ordinary\nincome to 33%. President‐elect Trump would maintain the top rate on capital gains at 20%, though it might be\napplicable at a lower threshold than current law. House Republicans would lower the top rate on capital gains to\none‐half of the highest rate imposed on ordinary income, or 16.5%. Both President‐elect Trump and the House\nRepublicans have proposed repealing (and replacing) the Affordable Care Act, which is the source of the current\n3.8% surtax. The Affordable Care Act is also the source of the extra 0.9% surtax on high‐income earners (wages\nexceeding $250,000 for couples; $200,000 for singles) and other indirect tax increases such as the reduced cap on\nflexible spending accounts and tighter rules for deducting medical expenses. A repeal of the Affordable Care Act\ncould lead to an immediate tax cut. President‐elect Trump would impose a $100,000 cap on itemized deductions\n($200,000 for joint filers); the House Republicans would eliminate itemized deductions other than charitable gifts\nand mortgage interest. Both President‐elect Trump and the House Republicans would eliminate the Alternative\nMinimum Tax. President‐elect Trump’s proposal would tax the income from “carried interests” as ordinary\nincome.\nPlanning. At its most basic, income tax planning is (i) timing income so it is recognized in a lower‐tax year, and (ii)\ntiming deductions so they are deducted in a higher‐tax year. However, the proposals listed above contain both\n“good news” and “bad news” for 2017, so we cannot offer a universal rule as to whether income or deductions\nare better recognized in 2016, 2017 or even 2018. Each taxpayer needs to make an educated prediction. If there\nis not a clear answer, sometimes it can make sense to recognize some income (or deductions) in one year and\nsome the next. That approach has the benefit of making sure you don’t completely pick the worse year.\nThe following are some general planning considerations.\n�\nInstallment sale. If a sale is made in return for an installment note, the resulting gain can be reported\non the installment method, meaning gain can be deferred into the year in which payment is received.\nNot all assets can be sold via the installment method, and there are several special rules. For example,\nmarketable securities cannot be sold and reported using the installment method. We have a separate\nWealth Strategy Report: Installment Sales.\nIf a sale is made for an installment note, you can also elect to be taxed in the year of sale rather than\ndeferring the gain. This election must be made by the due date (including extensions) of the return\nfor the year in which the sale occurred. Thus, an installment sale in 2016 could allow you to wait until\nas late as October 2017 to decide whether to use the installment method or report all the gain in\n2016. This could allow a decision to be made with 20/20 hindsight, at least as of October.\n�\nEquity‐based income. Certain types of compensation are tied to the value of an underlying stock. As\none example, a nonqualified compensatory stock option’s value will vary with the changing value of\nthe underlying stock. As another example, a grant of restricted stock will be taxed when it vests,\nunless a so‐called “83(b) election” is made to be taxed at the time of grant. In either case, the amount\nof compensation that is taxable will depend on the value of the stock at the appropriate time. When\ndeciding the most favorable tax year to recognize these types of equity‐based compensation, in\naddition to the usual considerations of the applicable tax rate, it is important to account for the\nexpected investment performance of the underlying stock. As a simple example, deferring a stock\noption exercise to the next year might produce a better result not because of a better tax rate but\nbecause of the expected growth in the stock’s value.\n2\nTAX ALERT 2016‐5: THE 2016 ELECTION: TAX CHANGES EXPECTED\n�\nRoth conversions. It is generally better to convert traditional retirement funds to a Roth IRA in a\nlower tax rate environment rather than a higher rate environment. For taxpayers who converted a\ntraditional IRA to a Roth IRA in 2016, the normal rules will provide a chance to review whether 2016\nor 2017 would be the better year for a conversion. Generally, a 2016 conversion can be unwound\n(“recharacterized”) as late as October 16, 2017. Following a recharacterization, the IRA could again\nbe converted to a Roth IRA 30 days later (assuming the original conversion occurred in 2016). Thus,\nyou could wait until October 2017 to determine whether 2016 or 2017 would be the better year for\nconversion based on the relative tax rates, changes in the market value of the retirement funds and\nother relevant considerations. If 2016, then you could let the 2016 conversion remain. If 2017, you\ncould “recharacterize” in October of 2017 and re‐convert 30 days later.\nESTATE AND GIFT TAX\nCurrent law. Under current law, the federal exemption for estate and gift tax is $5 million, subject to an inflation\nadjustment each year. For 2016, the exemption is $5,450,000, and for 2017, it is $5,490,000. For gifts or estates\nabove the exemption, the federal tax rate is 40%. If an appreciated asset is includible in the estate, it generally\nreceives a step‐up in basis for income tax purposes equal to the fair market value at death. Accordingly, there\nwould be little or no capital gains tax for appreciated assets sold soon after death.\nProposals. President‐elect Trump has proposed to repeal the estate tax. The House Republicans’ Tax Proposal\nalso proposes federal estate tax repeal. It would appear that such repeal would be temporary, unless the tax\nchanges proposed can be enacted on a revenue neutral basis. 2 It is not clear whether the federal gift tax would\nalso be repealed. The federal gift tax may be viewed as serving two purposes. First, it serves to support the estate\ntax, because without it you could make unlimited gifts during your life and thereby avoid federal estate tax at\ndeath. From that perspective, repealing the estate tax would suggest that the gift tax would also be repealed.\nHowever, the gift tax also serves to support the federal income tax. Without a gift tax, income‐producing property\ncould be given to family members or others in a lower tax bracket (or residing in a state without an income tax),\nand subsequently given back. From that perspective, repealing the estate tax would not suggest that the gift tax\nalso be repealed. Neither President‐elect Trump’s proposal nor the House Republicans’ Tax Proposal includes a\nrepeal of the gift tax.\nAs noted, appreciated assets includible in the estate generally receive a step‐up in basis. President‐elect Trump\nhas proposed to change this, however specific details have not been offered. The proposal sets forth a $10 million\nexemption for gains at death. It is not clear whether this exemption is for each decedent, or if that is the combined\nexemption for a married couple. It is also not clear whether any gains above the exemption would be subject to\ncapital gains tax at death (in effect a deemed sale at fair market value), or only subsequently when the asset is\nactually sold. It is also uncertain whether any unused exemption could be transferred to a surviving spouse.\n2\nIn order to comply with the Reconciliation procedure, the repeal needs to “sunset,” resulting in reinstatement of the estate\ntax after approximately 10 years. Under the 2001 Tax Act, there was a temporary repeal of the estate tax (and other taxes)\nfor this reason. Reconciliation rules will likely also add pressure to produce a revenue‐neutral tax bill in order to avoid such a\n“sunset.” That could cause Congress to abandon repealing the estate tax.\n3\nTAX ALERT 2016‐5: THE 2016 ELECTION: TAX CHANGES EXPECTED\nValuation discounts. On August 2, 2016, the IRS released proposed regulations, which may limit valuation\ndiscounts for transfers of interests in family‐controlled entities. 3 These regulations contain many ambiguities,\nand the IRS requested comments and held a public hearing on December 1, 2016. The regulations are\ncontroversial, many comments were sent and only a few clarifying changes were provided at the hearing. As a\nresult of the election, we believe it is likely the IRS will not proceed with these regulations. For now, there has\nbeen no official word from the IRS.\nPlanning. The proposal to repeal the federal estate tax appears straightforward, but will be complicated if it is\ntemporary. The possibility of reinstatement of the estate tax may be a reason for traditional estate planning\ntechniques, such as gifts and sales, to continue to be utilized. There is also significant uncertainty as to the related\nfederal gift tax and basis step‐up proposals. This makes current planning difficult because you may be comparing\nthe consequences of taking action currently (such as making a gift), with the uncertain future consequences of\nnot taking such action. Nevertheless, there are some general guidelines to consider.\n�\n�\nIt does not appear advisable to make a current gift that requires the payment of gift tax. Although\nthe gift tax may be less costly than the estate tax, that would not be true if the estate tax is repealed.\nThere are many types of “free” gifts that do not require the payment of gift tax, such as annual\nexclusion gifts, tuition and medical gifts, gifts utilizing the lifetime gift exemption, and zeroed‐out\nGRATs.\no\no\nIf such gifts are being considered only to save estate tax, it does not appear necessary to make\nthese gifts, unless there is an applicable state estate tax 4 . However, if repeal is temporary\nand the estate tax will be reinstated, then such gifts may continue to be advisable.\nIf such gifts are being considered for other non‐tax reasons (such as benefitting the recipient\nor asset protection), such gifts may still be beneficial. Even if the gift tax were repealed, you\nwould still have made the gift for free.\no If a gift will be made currently, it may be advisable to include flexible provisions, such as a\ntrust which allows for discretionary distributions to the donor’s spouse. This could allow the\ngift to be “undone” in the future by distributions to such spouse, if that becomes desirable.\nAs to future planning, it will obviously depend on what changes are enacted. If the estate tax is repealed, or if\nother significant changes are made, all wills, trusts and estate planning documents should be reviewed to\ndetermine if any revisions are desirable. Since most wills have dispositive provisions, such as credit shelter trusts\nand QTIP trusts, based on the estate tax, it will require a re‐thinking of estate planning and what dispositions and\ntrusts would be appropriate. Non‐tax considerations, such as trust provisions, asset protection and fiduciary\nselection, will play an enhanced role. If federal estate tax repeal is only temporary, it will presumably be necessary\nto include alternate dispositive provisions, in case the tax is reinstated.\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of the 2016 election are expected to lead to significant income and transfer tax changes, some through\nthe potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act and others through a push for comprehensive tax reform. In this\nTax Alert, we have highlighted some of the tax proposals, and the possible impact these changes may have on\n3\nWe have a separate Tax Alert 2016‐3, Proposed Regulations May Limit/Eliminate Valuation Discounts for Family Controlled\nEntities.\n4\nCertain states impose their own estate tax, independent of whether the federal estate tax is repealed.\n4\nTAX ALERT 2016‐5: THE 2016 ELECTION: TAX CHANGES EXPECTED\nplanning. It is our view that due to fiscal and political pressure to keep future budget deficits in check and the\nnarrow corridor which could result in the passage of a major tax bill (Reconciliation), we expect the tax bill to be\ncloser to the House Republicans’ Plan than the Trump Plan and perhaps narrower in scope. When more\ninformation is available, we expect to issue a more detailed Tax Alert.\n— National Wealth Planning Strategies\nIMPORTANT: This publication is designed to provide general information about ideas and strategies.
