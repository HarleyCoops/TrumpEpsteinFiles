The west antarctic ice sheet is melting at an unprecedented rate.. if it all goes into the ocean, \nsea levels will rise by about a meter. You are correct that we should ask if it can be reduced.. We are currently \ninvolved in a proposal that explores capturing CO2 from the atmosphere.. That may cost about 100/ton CO2.. if \nthere was a carbon tax, that might be doable. it is not clear yet, but total research on this so far <10 \nMillion. Total research each year on oil and gas exploration >2 billion. \nLawrence M.

That may be true at some level, and indeed during a period of the earth's history when there was \nmore CO2 (hundreds of millions of years ago), there were very large plants of certain types... but what does this imply, really? more \ncorn in the arctic? do we need more corn in the arctic?
