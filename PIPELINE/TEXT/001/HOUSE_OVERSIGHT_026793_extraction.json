Indyke, Esq. \nDarren K Indyke, PLLC \n575 Lexington Avenue- 4th floor \nNew York, NY 10022 \nRe: Jeffrey Epstein \nDear Mr. Indyke: \nAs you are aware, our firm represents TowersInvestors.com, Inc and Mr. Steven \nHoffenberg. \nMr Hoffenberg, through his long term contacts, as set forth below, believes he can assist \nMr. Epstein in resolving his existing disputes with the Federal government without any jail time \nand to arrange for the sale of his financial business interests. \nGovernor Ben Barnes is prepared to meet with President Trump with respect to obtaining \nan agreement with the Federal government. \nGary Baise, a Washington, D.0 based attorney who has worked as senior attorney in the \nDepartment of Justice, is working with us and will meet with the Department of Justice to obtain \nan advantageous agreement in exchange for Mr. Epstein's cooperation. \nLastly, Don Engel, who Mr. Epstein knows, who worked with Michael Milken at Drexel \nBurnhan, will work with Goldman Sachs to take over Mr. Epstein's business NOW. \nWe strongly believe that Mr. Epstein will benefit substantially from the foregoing and will \nwant to engage in mutually beneficial discussions. \nI am attaching a draft of a Complaint which Mr. Baise will file through local counsel if we \ncannot reach a mutually beneficial agreement. \nPlease contact me at your earliest convenience. \nVery truly yours, \nThe Mintz Fraade Law Firm P.0 \nCC: TowersInvestors.com \nAPF/TSG \nEncl.
