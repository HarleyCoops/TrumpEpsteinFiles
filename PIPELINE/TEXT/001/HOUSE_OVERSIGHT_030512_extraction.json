We set the news agenda for the BBC and in many \nrespects we set the daily news agenda for the country. Our interviews are regularly re broadcast across the BBC's national and \ninternational news network including - BBC World, BBC World Service and BBC Online. The combination of these outlets means \nthe global 'reach of a BBC Today programme interview is second to none. \nProgramme guests have included a selection of some of the biggest names in politics, business, international relations and the arts \nincluding US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, President Nicholas Sarkozy, President Hamid Karzai, HRH the Prince of Wales, \nformer President Musharraf, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former President Bill Clinton, Senator George Mitchell, Al \nGore, Kofi Annan, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Dalai Lama, Bill Gates, George Soros, Stephen Hawking, Sir Paul \nMcCartney, Mick Jaggar and Salman Rushdie. \nWe are a programme that carries considerable weight and influence and which prides itself in being a first port of call for many of the \nmost important and influential figures on the international stage. \nI can best be reached via my cell phone - \nMy very best wishes and my thanks! \nKirsty \nKirsty MacKenzie, \nInterviews Editor, \nToday Programme, \nBBC News \n- or this email address. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030512 \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk  \nThis e-mail (and any attachments) is confidential and may contain personal views which are not the views of the \nBBC unless specifically stated. \nIf you have received it in error, please delete it from your system. \nDo not use, copy or disclose the information in any way nor act in reliance on it and notify the sender \nimmediately. \nPlease note that the BBC monitors e-mails sent or received. \nFurther communication will signify your consent to this. \n--\n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
