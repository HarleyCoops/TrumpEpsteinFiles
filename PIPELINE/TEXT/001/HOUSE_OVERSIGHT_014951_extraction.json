As an adult, he created a robot to dance with: KUKA.\nTaiwanese dancer, choreographer, inventor, and videographer Huang Yi’s pioneering work is steeped in his fascination with the partnership\nbetween humans and robots. He interweaves continuous movement with mechanical and multimedia elements to create a form of dance\nwhich corresponds with the flow of data, effectively making the performer a dancing instrument. Named by Dance Magazine as one of the\n“25 to Watch,” Huang is one of Asia’s most prolific choreographers.\nHarmoniously weaving together the art of dance and the science of mechanical engineering, HUANG YI & KUKA is a poetic work that\nintertwines modern dance and visual arts with the realm of robotics, revealing humanity through a series of vignettes between live dancers\nand KUKA, a robot conceptualized and programmed by Huang. “Dancing face to face with a robot is like looking at my own face in a\nmirror...I think I have found the key to spin human emotions into robots,” Huang asserts.\nHUANG YI & KUKA is an original production of Huang Yi Studio +, developed at 3LD Art & Technology Center, in association with\nSozo Artists. Commissioned by Quanta Arts Foundation.\nfacebook.com/HuangYiStudio\nAnab Jain\nFuturist, designer\nSuperflux co-founder and TED Fellow Anab Jain parses uncertainties around our shared futures to create provocative experiences, tools\nand tactics that we can adopt today.\nIn 2009, Anab Jain co-founded the design firm Superflux with Jon Ardern, inspired by influences as far-flung as avant-garde architecture\nand Andrei Tarkovsky. The challenges Jain explores are some of the biggest -- climate change, biotech, intelligent machines -- and her\nresulting work “navigates the entangled wilderness of our technology, politics, culture and environment to imagine new ways of seeing,\nbeing and acting.”\nIn her work, Jain creates worlds, stories and tools that provoke and inspire us to engage with the precarity of our rapidly changing world.\nSuperflux is building tools, methods and commons that can enable us to mitigate the shock of food insecurity and climate change. Recently\nthey produced a series of civilian drones, and created a vision of a near-future city where these intelligent machines begin to display\nincreasing autonomy with civic society. Among Superflux’s previous projects is a headset allowing blind subjects injected with a lightsensitive\nvirus to develop a kind of “super-sight” sensitive to spectrums that ordinary vision cannot detect.\nsuperflux.in @anabjain\nGarry Kasparov\nhttps://ted2017.ted.com/program\nPage 1 of 21\nTED2017: The future you\n4/20/17, 12:07 PM\nGarry Kasparov\nGrandmaster, analyst\nGarry Kasparov is esteemed by many as the greatest chess player of all time. Now he’s engaged in a game with far higher stakes: the\npreservation of democracy.\nWhen 22-year-old Garry Kasparov became the world’s youngest chess Grand Champion, few could predict his turbulent career in chess or\nas a dissident. His chessboard wizardry was already the stuff of legend when, in 1997, he made headlines when he lost a rematch to IBM’s\nDeep Blue supercomputer, ushering AI into the public sphere.\nKasparov’s book Winter Is Coming details the rise of Putin’s Russia as well as Kasparov’s persecution and self-exile, and it serves chilling\nwarnings of reactionary forces gathering in the West. He is the chair of the Human Rights Foundation, succeeding his predecessor Vaclav\nHavel.\nkasparov.com @Kasparov63\nLaura Galante\nCyberspace analyst\nLaura Galante analyzes how states use cyberspace: a domain where militaries, intelligence services, criminal groups and individuals pursue\ntheir interests with far fewer restraints than in the physical world.\nAt FireEye, Galante's teams have profiled advanced cyber threats, investigated network breaches and portrayed the political, military and\nfinancial implications of cyber operations. Part of the original Mandiant Intelligence team, Galante has led strategic analysis, developed\nintelligence capabilities and offerings, and directed publications including APT28: A Window into Russia’s State Cyber Espionage; Red\nLine Drawn: China Recalculates its Use of Cyber Espionage; and Hacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market among others.\nIn November 2016 she spoke at the UN Security Council’s Arria Formula meeting on cybersecurity and international peace and security.\nShe frequently appears on and provides commentary to: CNN, Bloomberg, NPR, BBC, Fox News, the New York Times, The Financial\nTimes, The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, the Associated Press and other global and industry media. Prior to her work at FireEye and\nMandiant, Galante led a contractor team analyzing cyber capability development and military doctrine at the US Department of Defense.\nShe supported the 2010 US-Russia bilateral information security talks.\nfireeye.com @LauraLGalante\nOK Go\nBand\nA wildly creative band of music- and video-makers, OK Go is building a media empire on the back of endless, boundless ingenuity.\nWith a career that includes award-winning videos, New York Times op-eds, a major label split and the establishment of a DIY trans-media\nmini-empire (Paracadute), collaborations with pioneering dance companies and tech giants, animators and Muppets, and an experiment that\naims to encode Hungry Ghosts on actual strands of DNA, OK Go continue to fearlessly dream and build new worlds in a time when\ncreative boundaries have all but dissolved.\nThe band has been honored with a Grammy, three MTV Video Music Awards (one of them from Japan!), a CLIO, three UK Music Video\nAwards, two Webby Awards (including one for their collaboration with The Muppets and Sesame Street) and a spot in a Guggenheim\ninstallation. Their latest video is “The One Moment,” directed by the band's singer, Damian Kulash Jr.\nokgo.net @okgo\nTim Ferriss\nHuman guinea pig, author\nTim Ferriss is author of \"The 4-Hour Workweek,\" a self-improvement program of four steps: defining aspirations, managing time, creating\nautomatic income and escaping the trappings of the 9-to-5.\nTim Ferris brings an analytical yet accessible approach to the challenges of self-improvement and career advancement through what he\ncalls \"lifestyle design.\" His 2007 book, The 4-Hour Workweek, and his lectures on productivity are stuffed with moving, encouraging\nanecdotes -- often from his own life -- that show how simple decisions, made despite fears or hesitation, can make for a drastically more\nmeaningful day-to-day experience at work, or in life.\nWord-of-blog chatter in Silicon Valley may have propelled his book to bestselling success, but Ferriss himself takes a fervid stance against\nthe distractions of technology toys that promote unnecessary multitasking. Following the success of his book, Ferriss has become a fulltime\nangel investor.\nTitus Kaphar\nArtist\nTitus Kaphar's artworks interact with the history of art by appropriating its styles and mediums.\nAs Titus Kaphar says of his work: “I’ve always been fascinated by history: art history, American history, world history, individual history -\n- how history is written, recorded, distorted, exploited, reimagined, and understood. In my work I explore the materiality of reconstructive\nhistory. I paint and I sculpt, often borrowing from the historical canon, and then alter the work in some way. I cut, crumple, shroud, shred,\nstitch, tar, twist, bind, erase, break, tear, and turn the paintings and sculptures I create, reconfiguring them into works that nod to hidden\nnarratives and begin to reveal unspoken truths about the nature of history.\"\nHis latest works are an investigation into the highest and lowest forms of recording history.

Historical portraiture, mug shots, and YouTube stills challenge viewers to consider how we document the past, and what we\nhave erased. Rather than explore guilt or innocence, Kaphar engages the narratives of individuals and how we as a society manage and\ndefine them over time. As a whole, this exhibition explores the power of rewritten histories to question the presumption of innocence and\nthe mythology of the heroic.\nkapharstudio.com\nRabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks\nReligious leader\nIn a world violently polarized by extremists, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks is proposing and advocating solutions to mounting religious\nintolerance.\nRabbi Lord Sacks is one of Judaism’s spiritual leaders, and he exercises a primary influence on the thought and philosophy of Jews and\npeople of all faiths worldwide. Since stepping down as Chief Rabbi of the UK and Commonwealth in 2013, Rabbi Lord Sacks has become\nan increasingly well-known speaker, respected moral voice and writer; his 2015 book is Not in God's Name: Confronting Religious\nViolence.\nGranted a seat in the British House of Lords in 2009, Rabbi Lord Sacks is a key Jewish voice for universalism and an embrace of tolerance\nbetween religions and cultures. He rejects the “politics of anger” brought about by the way “we have acted as if markets can function\nwithout morals, international corporations without social responsibility and economic systems without regard to their effect on the people\nleft stranded by the shifting tide.\" He also sees, as a key idea for faith in our times, that unity in heaven creates diversity on earth.\nrabbisacks.org @rabbisacks\nTuesday, April 25, 8:30AM - 10:15AM PDT\nSession 2: Our Robotic Overlords\nHosted by Chris Anderson and Helen Walters.\nMarc Raibert\nRoboticist\nMarc Raibert is the founder and CEO of robot maker Boston Dynamics.\nWorking with his team at Boston Dynamics, Marc Raibert builds some of the world’s most advanced robots, such as BigDog, Atlas, Spot\nand Handle. These robots are inspired by the remarkable ability of animals to move with agility, dexterity, perception and intelligence. A\nkey ingredient of these robots is their dynamic behavior, which contributes to their lifelike qualities and their effectiveness in the real\nworld.\nRaibert founded Boston Dynamics as a spinoff from MIT, where he ran the Leg Laboratory, which helped establish the scientific basis for\nhighly dynamic robots. He was a professor of EE&CS at MIT and before that associate professor of CS & Robotics at Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity. Raibert is a member of the National Academy of Engineering.\nbostondynamics.com\nNoriko Arai\nAI expert\nCould an AI pass the entrance exam for the University of Tokyo? Noriko Arai oversees a project that wants to find out.\nNoriko Arai is the program director of an AI challenge, Todai Robot Project, which asks the question: Can AI get into the University of\nTokyo? The project aims to visualize both the possibilities and the limitation of current AI by setting a concrete goal: a software system\nthat can pass university entrance exams. In 2015 and 2016, Todai Robot achieved top 20 percent in the exams, and passed more than 60\npercent of the universities in Japan.\nThe inventor of Reading Skill Test, in 2017 Arai conducted a large-scale survey on reading skills of high and junior high school students\nwith Japan's Ministry of Education. The results revealed that more than half of junior high school students fail to comprehend sentences\nsampled from their textbooks. Arai founded the Research Institute of Science for Education to elucidate why so many students fail to read\nand how she can support them.\nnii.ac.jp/en/faculty/society/arai_noriko researchmap.jp/arai_noriko/english\nStuart Russell\nAI expert\nStuart Russell wrote the standard text on AI; now he thinks deeply on AI's future -- and the future of us humans too.\nStuart Russell is a professor (and formerly chair) of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at University of California at Berkeley.\nHis book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (with Peter Norvig) is the standard text in AI; it has been translated into 13 languages\nand is used in more than 1,300 universities in 118 countries.

The algorithm looks like the simple face\ndetection of a camera app but with the level complexity of systems like Google's Deep Mind Cloud Vision, using Convolutional Deep\nNeural Networks to crunch object detection in realtime. It's the kind of technology that will be embedded on all smartphones in the next\nfew years.\nRedmon is also internet-famous for his resume.\npjreddie.com @pjreddie\nTom Gruber\nAI developer\nAs co-creator of Siri, Tom Gruber helped redefine the role of machine intelligence in our lives and transformed the way we interact with\nour devices.\nBy connecting humans and machines with AI, designer, inventor and polymath Tom Gruber is opening up new ways to improve our lives\nand augment human intelligence.\nGruber led the team that revolutionized human-machine interaction with Siri, the intelligent personal assistant that can understand your\nspoken language and help you get things done.

Through Last Mile Health, 2017 TED\nPrize winner Raj Panjabi aims to extend health services to all -- by training members of the community.\nRaj Panjabi was nine years old when civil war broke out in his native country of Liberia. His family fled, eventually resettling in High\nPoint, North Carolina. Raj dreamed of going to medical school and, as a student in 2005, he returned to Liberia. He was shocked to find a\nhealth care system in total devastation. Only 50 doctors remained to treat a population of four million.\nWith a small team of Liberian civil war survivors, American health workers and $6,000 he'd received as a wedding gift, Panjabi cofounded\nLast Mile Health in 2007. Initially focused on care for HIV patients, Last Mile Health has grown into a robust organization that\npartners with the government of Liberia to recruit, train, equip and employ community health care workers who provide a wide range of\nservices to their neighbors in Liberia's most remote regions. In 2016, Last Mile Health workers treated 50,000 patients, including nearly\n22,000 cases of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea in children. While the organization focuses on integrated primary care, its network can be\nleveraged in a crisis. In the fight against Ebola, Last Mile Health supported government response by training 1,300 health workers in\nsoutheastern Liberia.\nPanjabi is a physician in the Division of Global Health Equity at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital and an advisor\nto the Clinton Global Initiative.

But radiation used in the wrong way can be harmful. To maximize the benefits of the many different types of\nradiation, we need to understand exactly how they affect us -- from our DNA to the whole person.\nBrenner directs the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Medical Center. He started his career in theoretical physics --\napplying quantum mechanics to radiation therapy. While he has no doubt forgotten everything he knew about quantum mechanics, he has\nretained his love for applying hard-core physics concepts to solve biological problems. David has designed new “patient friendly”\napproaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy that are now in common use worldwide, and he is currently very excited about the\nprospects of beating pancreatic cancer with new types of radiation.\nOver the past 6 years, Brenner has also been working towards a safe way to kill drug-resistant bacteria such as MRSA, as well as airborne\nviruses such as influenza, using a unique type of ultra-violet light.\ncolumbia.edu/~djb3 @CRR_CUMC\nLevon Biss\nPhotographer\nWith his \"Microsculpture\" series, Levon Biss photographs the incredible details of insects.\nLevon Biss is a British photographer who works across many genres, including reportage, sport and portraiture.
