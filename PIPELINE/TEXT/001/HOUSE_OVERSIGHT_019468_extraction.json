He served 13 months in prison.\nPresident Clinton had been so close to both to Epstein he had joined him on his private jet and stayed on\nhis private Caribbean island.\nSpeaking to the Mail On Sunday in 2011, Virginia Roberts - who claims in court papers she was kept as\nEpstein's 'sex slave' and forced to sleep with Prince Andrew three times - said she met President Clinton\ntwice, but was never 'lent out'.\nBuckingham Palace vehemently denies the claims, as does Maxwell. Her legal team stresses she was not\ninvolved in, or connected to the criminal proceedings against Epstein and with regards to Virginia\nRoberts' claims, they stressed she denies each and every allegation.\nVirginia, now a married mother of three, claimed that President Clinton traveled with Epstein to a number\nof destinations, including three times on the billionaire’s private jet, and enjoyed intimate dinners with\nboth him and Maxwell.\nOn one occasion, she said that Epstein flew the former President, Hollywood actor and staunch Democrat\nKevin Spacey and another actor friend of Mr Clinton’s, Chris Tucker, to Africa, to ‘discuss AIDS policy’.\nEpstein, who has donated more than £75,000 over the years to candidates from the Democratic Party,\nalso flew with President Clinton in November 2003 to destinations including Russia, Oslo, Hong Kong,\nShanghai and Beijing.\nOn one occasion, she alleged, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his\nisland for President Clinton shortly after he left office. But, as far as she knows, the ex-President did not\ntake the bait.\nMaxwell declines to comment on Prince Andrew allegations\nMysterious: Ghislaine Maxwell beams as her ex-lover, disgraced billionaire Jeffrey Epstein\nhugs her as they attend a Manhattan bash on March 15, 2005 - the same day Palm Beach\npolice launched an investigation into his abuse of underage girls\n‘I’d have been about 17 at the time,’ she said: ‘I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine\nMaxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her.\n‘She’d always wanted to fly and Jeffrey paid for her to take lessons, and I remember she was very excited\nbecause she got her licence around the first year we met.\n'I used to get frightened flying with her but Bill had the Secret Service with him and I remember him\ntalking about what a good job she did.\n‘I only ever met Bill twice but Jeffrey had told me that they were good friends.\n'I asked, “How come?” and he laughed and said, “He owes me some favours.” Maybe he was just joking but\nit constantly surprised me that people with as much to lose as Bill and [Prince] Andrew weren’t more\ncareful.'\nShe said that when dining that night, Maxwell sat at President Clinton's left, while they were joined by two\n'olive-skinned brunettes' who had been flown in from New York.\nVirginia claimed: 'I’d never met them before. I’d say they were no older than 17, very innocent-looking.\n‘They weren’t there for me. They weren’t there for Jeffrey or Ghislaine because I was there to have sex with\nJeffrey on the trip.\n‘Maybe Jeffrey thought they would entertain Bill, but I saw no evidence that he was interested in them. He\nand Jeffrey and Ghislaine seemed to have a very good relationship. Bill was very funny\n'He made me laugh a few times. And he and Jeffrey and Ghislaine told blokey jokes and the brunettes\nlistened politely and giggled.\nStar of the night: Rod Stewart and his wife Penny at the Cipriani Wall Street event, where\nhe performed in front of a crowd including Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein\nNew York elite: Padma Lakshmi (left) and Sean Lennon (right) both attended the Cipriani\nWall Street event\nIndeed, the trio were so close that DailyMail.com told last week how Epstein kept 21 numbers for\nPresident Clinton in his contacts book, under the name of his adviser Doug Band.\nAs Virginia Roberts' astonishing claims have made headlines around the world, it was reported last week\nthat President Clinton's continuing friendship with Maxwell has caused a rift between him and his wife,\npotential Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\nHowever, the pair were pictured looking cosy together as they left the funeral of former New York\nGovernor Mario Cuomo.\nEpstein and Maxwell met shortly after she moved to New York in the 1990s following the death of her\nfather, shamed newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell.\nAnd they remained just as close even after an initial romance faded.\nFor Epstein, Maxwell was a useful conduit to some of the most powerful people in the world, from\nPresidentClinton to Prince Andrew.\nClose: Not only was Ghislaine Maxwell friends with Prince Andrew, but his ex-wife Sarah\nFerguson as well. The pair are pictured together at the opening of the Asprey Flagship\nStore on 5th Avenue on December 8, 2003, in New York City\nAllegations: Ghislaine Maxwell is accused of 'facilitating Prince Andrew's acts of sexual\nabuse by acting as a madame for Epstein'. Above, Miss Maxwell looks on as Prince Andrew\nsmiles with Virginia Roberts in 2001\nWhile Maxwell became used to the luxuries that Epstein could afford her, trips by private jet and his very\nown Caribbean island.\nRarely photographed or seen out in public unlike his friend Maxwell, Esptein was however pictured with\nthe brunette as they partied the night away on March 15, 2005, at a Manhattan charity event featuring\nsinger Rod Stewart.\nBut as they socialized with the cream of Manhattan society, including CBS President Les Moonves, his wife\nJulie Chen, Sean Lennon and Padma Lakshmi, at the Wall Street Rising event, Epstein, now 63, and\nMaxwell, would have been entirely unaware of a police probe that was launched that very day.\nIn May 2006, a 'probable cause affidavit' revealed that Epstein was the subject of an 11-month undercover\ninvestigation by police after a complaint in 2005 from the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl, who claimed\nshe was paid $300 to give him an erotic massage at his flamingo-pink villa in Palm Beach.\nClose: Ghislaine Maxwell with Jeffrey Epstein (left) at The Queen's residence of\nSandringham in 2000. The picture shows just how close she and Epstein were with Prince\nAndrew\nThe girl is said to have been taken there by 18-year-old student Haley Robson, who claims in a sworn\nstatement that she was recruited at the age of 17 to provide the billionaire with a $200 nude massage.\nOne of the girls ‘cried hysterically’, according to a police report, as she recalled how she was recruited to\nprovide services for Epstein when she was 16.\nShe claims in a sworn statement that he introduced her to a woman whom he said he had brought from\nYugoslavia ‘to be his sex slave’.\nEpstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from a minor - a minor in the US is someone younger than\n18 - and served 13 months in prison.\nNow, lawyers for four of Epstein's alleged victims are fighting to get a federal non-prosecution agreement\nagainst Epstein thrown out so he can potentially face criminal charges for allegedly sexually abusing the\nwomen, one of whom says she was only 13 at the time of the assault.\nBizarrely, Maxwell was initially served with a subpoena in September 2009, as she was leaving the Clinton\nGlobal Initiatives Conference in New York.\nPower people: Ghislaine Maxwell and newspaper billionaire Rupert Murdoch, pictured\ntogether in at the Fifth Important Dinner for Women hosted by Her Majesty Queen Rania\nAl Abdullah, Wendi Murdoch and Indra Nooyi in New York in September 2010\nEpstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from a minor - a minor in the US is someone younger than\n18 - and served 13 months in prison.\nNow, lawyers for four of Epstein's alleged victims are fighting to get a federal non-prosecution agreement\nagainst Epstein thrown out so he can potentially face criminal charges for allegedly sexually abusing the\nwomen, one of whom says she was only 13 at the time of the assault.\nAs for Maxwell, bizarrely, she was initially served with a subpoena in September 2009, as she was leaving\nthe Clinton Global Initiatives Conference in New York, and continues to deny all allegations made against\nher.\nGossip girls: Ghislaine Maxwell (right) and Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford at an event\nto celebrate Anna Netrebko's new album 'Verdi', in New York in September 2013\nShare or comment on this article\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n"
