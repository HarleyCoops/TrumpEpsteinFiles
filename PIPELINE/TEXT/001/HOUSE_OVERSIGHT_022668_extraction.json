I mean I can see why a statement might help \nin some way -- but its Andrew (not clinton and the rest) that is keeping the story alive. Until you are \nable to come forward and address that the story lives on. I mean in the end he had consensual sex \nwith M. And Mworked for you. The rest is atmospherics. You have moved on! People don't know \nthat and cant accept that unless you say as much. \nDoes franc drama worry you? Am writing on it now... \nOn Fri, Jan 16, 2015 at 2:35 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation(&,gmail.com> wrote: \nvery well, my reputation has admittedly taken a hit. however, again, more calls re currency than i can \nhandle. in addition I am considering a statement and positon that Out of respect and love for my former \ngirlfrend I have tried to keep her out of my mess. she was never questioned, or subpeonaed. her name never \nsurfaced..
