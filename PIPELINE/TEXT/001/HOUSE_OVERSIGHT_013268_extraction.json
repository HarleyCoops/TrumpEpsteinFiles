Tasked to modify and refurbish a\nGlobal 5000 for the sports entertainment giant, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE,\nformerly WWF), New York-based International Jet Interiors is putting a progressive spin\non cabin design. While the livery boasts WWE’s corporate colours, the interiors use\n“hand-woven carpets, custom-made metal finishes including a spun black pearl finish,\ncustom-dyed leathers and bespoke seating from Italy”, says Eric Roth, the designer at\nInternational Jet Interiors’ helm.\nBut the highlight is in the high-tech facilities: studio-grade equipment that enables on-thefly\nediting of feeds from live sports entertainment shows, which are transmitted via on-board\nsatellite. Meanwhile, specially programmed iPad minis control the cabin functions. “It will be\nthe ultimate couture craft when completed in January 2014,” says Roth.\nNo stranger to special client requests, Roth says he loves the challenge — the more unusual\nthe request, the more he and his team seem to excel in delivering the solution. His clients\ncome from around the world with a varied wish-list, ranging from entertainment systems with\nsatellite TV and high-speed WiFi to 24-karat gold-plated fixtures throughout the craft. >>\nThe more unusual the request, the more Roth and\nhis team seem to excel in delivering the solution\nJETGALA\n49\nWINGS\n“Helping clients strategise is a key part of the\ndesign process. I look at how long they have owned\nthe craft and at its depreciating asset value”\n50 jetGALA\nDetails set Roth’s work\napart from other aircraft\ninteriors — from the\nchoice of lighting, carpet,\nupholstery and cabinetry,\nto gadget stowage and\ndining accessories\n>> Its refurbishment of Donald Trump’s Boeing 757,\nfor instance, included a 24-karat gold-plated bathroom\nsink. Other projects have required reconfiguring the\nseating layout to make kennel space for hunting dogs,\ninstalling ultra-secure bassinets for newborn infants,\nand wrapping a toilet seat in crocodile skin for a client\nin India.\nRoth says that as a designer and design director,\nhis main task is to develop an intimate understanding\nof a client’s lifestyle and his use of the jet — the\npercentage of time spent for business, pleasure,\ncorporate entertainment and family time. “Helping\nclients strategise is a key part of the design process. I\nlook at how long they have owned the craft and at its\ndepreciating asset value, and work out if it’s worth it to\ninvest in the latest piece of technology or ultra comfort\naccessory. Most of them will opt for the investment\nbecause they want their aircraft to be up-to-date, even if\nthis does not up its asset value.”\nAt times, thorough strategising is needed even before\nInternational Jet Interiors accepts a project. A US-based\nfilm producer once wanted a ‘sky studio’ so that he\nand his four-member team could edit films onboard\nhis Gulfstream. This required state-of-the-art editing\nequipment, surround sound, and a 42-inch, flat-screen,\nhigh-definition TV. “The client perceived the theatre >>\nJETGALA\n51\nWINGS\n52 jetGALA\n>> aspect as the great challenge — yet it was balancing\nthe weight of the floor-plan change and equipment\nfurnishing that was the real challenge. The structural\nand technical analysis consumed the better part of\nthree weeks before we could make the commitment to\nproduce this unique aircraft,” says Roth.\nDespite many quirky refurbishing requests, Roth says\na fair percentage of his clients avoid using their aircraft\nto make a statement: “They will come to me saying ‘Eric,\nI want it to be luxuriously comfortable,\nvery functional but extremely understated’.” Nearly\n75 per cent of the firm’s clients are US-based, but it is\nnow receiving more requests from private-jet owners in\nAsia. The company has worked with clients in Shanghai,\nTokyo and Mumbai, and is in discussions with new\ncustomers in Africa.\nHe hopes to one day produce a “green and\nsustainable” solution for a client. That may sound like\nan oxymoron, and it will take a designer used to pushing\nthe limits of convention to create such a ground-breaking\ndesign. It looks like Roth is cut out for the job.\nOPPOSITE\nInternational Jet Interiors\nachieves a sleek, streamlined\nappeal by modifying an\naircraft’s window line\nand periphery, and using\ncomposite materials\nexclusively\nTHIS PAGE\nHand-stitched leathers and\nfinely woven fabrics create\na luxurious, comfortable\nambiance\nGadgets can be configured\nto control the lightings in the\ncabin interior\n“Clients come to me\nsaying ‘Eric, I want it to be\nluxuriously comfortable,\nvery functional but\nextremely understated’.”\nJETGALA\n53\n"
