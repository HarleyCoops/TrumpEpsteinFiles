    "full_text": "From: Deepak Chopra \nSent: 6/6/2018 11:32:09 AM \nTo: Jeff Epstein [jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: Lunch with Deepak I: LSD, Quantum Healing, and Plato I Psychology Today \nImportance: High \nFYI \nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psyched/201806/1unch-deepak-i-lsd-quantum-healing-and-\nplato?amp& twitter impression=true  \nLunch with Deepak I: LSD, Quantum \nHealing, and Plato \nA skeptic and a mystic seek common ground. Part one of four. \nPosted Jun 04, 2018 \nIn March, I attended a debate on the proposition \"The more we evolve, the less we need \nGod,\" With Michael Shermer and Heather Berlin for the motion and Deepak Chopra and \nAnoop Kumar against the motion. The next day I published an account titled \"Do Not  \nDebate Deepak Chopra\" (subtitle: \"He's not even wrong.\"). Soon after, Chopra reached out \nto me and invited me to lunch. In April I met him in his office at Deepak Homebase in \nManhattan, we had lunch downstairs at ABC Kitchen, and returned to his office. This is a \nnearly full transcript of our two-hour conversation. \nThis is part 1 of 4. Here are parts 2, and \nMatt: So, I'm curious why you invited me, what you wanted to talk about. \nDeepak: I read your article, \"Not Even Wrong.\" [Laughter.] That's been my label for a long \ntime from a lot of people, so I thought I'd give you my perspective on what I think reality is \nand see if we can expand the conversation. \nMatt: So the debate, it seemed like it was ships crossing in the night. The two sides were \ntalking about different things and so I think it was clear to___or everyone else had one \nconception about what the debate was going to be about: the usefulness of the idea of God as \nconceived in monotheistic religions. Whereas the two of you were___it seemed like you were \navoiding that debate and talking about something else. \nDeepak: So let me give you a little background to that. The first time we were invited to the \ndebate by the organizers____I didn't know who they were___the topic was, \"As we evolve do \nwe need religion?\" So I called the organizers and I said, \"Let me rephrase that if you don't \nmind. Can we say, As we evolve do we need religious experience?' So they said \"We don't \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029509 \nknow what that means.\" I said, as I look across the religions of the world, the common \nfeatures I see are: Number one: transcendence___as a religious experience, not the dogma, \nnot the ideology, not the institution___but transcendence, going beyond subject-object split. \nNumber two: the emergence of platonic values as a result of that experience, like the desire \nto know the truth, goodness, beauty, harmony, love, compassion, joy, equanimity, gratitude  \nand humility, wonder, curiosity. It's very human but it gets overshadowed by everyday \nexperience. And number three: a loss of the fear of death, because that happens to \nexperience, not to the consciousness in which that experience occurs. I think they didn't \nunderstand that, honestly, so they rephrased it as \"Do we need God?\" So I said, \"Listen, \nbefore I even go there, can we have a conversation?\" So they were very gracious. We all got \ntogether with the board or whatever and we had a conversation. I said, \"Honestly, God is a \nvery loaded term and if by God we mean some imagined deity or some dead white male in \nthe sky then it's not something that we can even address because we don't have that \nconception of God as an imagined deity.\" \nMatt: You mean that's not something you personally can address? \nDeepak: Yeah I can't address it, nor can my partner. They said, \"Well if you make that clear \nup front, then it's fine, but we still want to maintain God in the title.\" So I was keen to have \nthis conversation because Michael and I have been going back and forth for 30 years now, \nand I thought, Michael's come to a very good place with me personally. So we agreed to the \ntitle. But if you go to the Eastern wisdom traditions___Buddhism, Vedanta, Shaoism, all the \nEastern traditions___then God is pure consciousness, period. So the debate, you're right, they \nwere talking about the mythical God and we were talking about that which is inconceivable \nas consciousness but makes every concept possible. \nSo I can give you a background on that because monotheistic religions are at war all the time \namongst each other, and all of the problems in the world right now are a consequence of \nthat. But nobody talks about \"What is a religious or spiritual experience?\" Hundreds of \nmillions of people across the world don't have that idea at all that the monotheistic religions \npropose. In fact, if you go deep into the teachings of Buddhism, etc., the word God is not \nmentioned. Only consciousness is mentioned. Vedanta, only consciousness is mentioned. \nAnd it's a very different take on consciousness. So, if you'll allow me for a moment to \nexplain that. So when I was a kid, I grew up in India with a father who was agnostic or \natheist, who was trained in England as a cardiologist. He went on to become a very famous \nperson. He discovered high altitude mountain sickness. When the Indian and Chinese army \nwere fighting in Tibet he was putting catheters in people's hearts and measuring their \ncardiac pressures. He described high altitude pulmonary edema and hypertension. My \nmother was what you might call a Hindu. But even when she told us stories as kids and she \ntalked about all these mythical gods and goddesses, she emphasized the fact that these are \nmythical, imaginary, symbolic expressions of deep aspirations in human consciousness to \nunderstand reality. Now she was also, by the way, she wasn't a very educated woman like \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029510 \nmy father was. But she had enough ideas in her upbringing to say that the world you \nexperience as everyday reality is not real. She would say that probably because she had \nheard it an amount of times. But when you're a child, that sticks with you, that the world \nyou experience is not real. So that's my childhood background until I went to medical \nschool. Medical school, I embraced everything that my father had taught about reality being \nphysical, material. He was actually more than___he was almost like Michael Shermer in the \nearlier days when I was growing up. \nMatt: How did your parents get along? \nDeepak: Oh he was a very loving person. \nMatt: Completely different philosophies. \nDeepak: Yeah but he was an amazing person in terms of being a physician. I mean this is \nlong before technology. He could listen to a heart with a stethoscope and tell you, which you \nmay or may not know, the PR interval, which means the difference in microseconds between \nthe atrial and the ventricular beat, which you could verify on an electrocardiogram. He was \nastonishing as a diagnostician. He trained with Wallace Brigden in England who was one of \nthe earlier pioneers in electrocardiography. He was a consultant to the royal heart hospital to \nthe queen at one time before he came back to India, the British army. So, he was an amazing \nperson but he was also very compassionate. On weekends he would see patients free of \ncharge, and my mother would cook food for them and make sure they had enough money for \ntheir bus or their train. So there was a very compassionate aspect to him, but he didn't \nbelieve in religion or anything like that. \nSo then when I went to medical school I totally embraced my father's constructs. Except for \none or two experiences during medical school, which was in India by the way. And it was \none of the newer medical schools after British independence, called the Indian Institute of \nMedical Sciences, and it was funded by, amongst other people, the Rockefeller Foundation, \nand so we had lots of international faculty. So in my fourth year of medical school, when the \nBeatles were in India___that's George Harrison behind you, by the way, in a turban sitting \nnext to me. So that is a later picture but the Beatles came to India in 1969, when I was \nfinishing my medical school. I didn't know these guys at that time. But Sergeant Pepper's \nhad come out, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, and we had four medical students as visitors \nto our classroom for the summer from Harvard. And they had with them a bunch of LSD. So \nmy first experience was___and I was just near 18, when we had the first LSD experience. \nAnd then another one. Twice. And suddenly what my mother had been saying all these years \nabout the world being an illusion was in the way an epiphany to me, at the age of 17. I mean \nI saw that the construction of___dissolving of boundaries like this, this, this and melting \naway. And then just colors and shapes and forms and sounds. And then a vast nothingness \nwith no boundaries. But I was there. Not as a body, not as a mind, not as anything I could \nidentify with, but just totally boundless. It was totally life-shifting at the age of 18 years. But \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029511 \nthen what happened is the medical school is very busy. You have to study, pass exams, this, \nthat. And I put that aside, that experience side. \nThen at the age of 22, I came to the United States, and I had to do a lot of hardship to get \nhere. My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps and be an academic. He was a \nprofessor, too, of cardiology. So I worked hard. India wasn't encouraging people to leave. I \nhad to go to Sri Lanka to pass my exams, I had to borrow money to get a flight to the United \nStates, I passed all that, I had to spend a year in New Jersey at a very ordinary community \nhospital, hard-working, and I got a residency in Boston with various hospitals with \nacademics. So, Harvard, Tufts, BU, internal medicine, hard work, no thinking about \nconsciousness whatsoever. Just passing one exam after another, getting one fellowship after \nanother. \nAnd then I came here in 1970, July 1, basically as an intern in a hospital that no longer exists \nin New Jersey, MuhlenbergHospital, but then in the next year I got into all these academic \ninstitutions in Boston and went from one to another. I trained in internal medicine. And then \nI had heard vaguely of a discipline called neuroendocrinology, and I had also heard vaguely \nof this new revolution in medicine at that time, which was looking at peptides in the \ncirculation. And the peptide that was very popular at that time was something called opiates, \nwhich are now popular again, and the opioid receptor, with somebody called George \nSolomon in Washington, who was an expert in that, but I discovered that the number one \nguy in the world in neuroendocrinology at that time was a professor at Tufts New England \nMedical Center, and his name was Seymour Reichlin and he was a legend. Okay, so, if you \nfound a snake in his garden he would dissect it and look at the hypothalamus and identify \nreceptors for opioids, serotonin, this and that. I'll show you his photo recently. I just met him \nthe other day at the consciousness conference, which is bizarre because I hadn't met him in \nall these years. He's 94, and he was giving a lecture on serotonin and mystical experiences, \nat the age of 94, and he came to my lecture, and he was one of the most amazing guys in the \nworld, actually. It was a real joy to meet him. This is him, let me show you. Anyway I'll \nshow you his photo in a second. He's 94, he gives talks on serotonin, but he was a legend. \nI got a fellowship with him, and through him I met somebody who is no longer alive, \nCandace Pert, who had actually discovered the opioid receptor, and she and I met at a \nconference. She later became the chief of brain chemistry at the NIH. And she told me these \nmolecules that we're talking about, serotonin, opiates, oxytocin, dopamine they are the \nmolecules of emotion. So that's the first time I've heard that expression. I said, \"You should \nwrite a book about it.\" She did. I wrote the foreword and it was for me one of the milestones \nof my life. And so I applied to Reichlin's fellowship and I got it, and it was like the most \nprestigious thing you could get. \nBut then I had my own issues with medicine. Is this interesting to you? So I had my own \nissues, including the fact that I was seeing patients and I can see that the response was not \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029512 \npredictable. You could give two patients the same disease and they had completely different \noutcomes. So at least in human beings, we didn't respond predictably. As does always occur, \nthe bell-shaped curve, which there is to everything now. So, I started getting interested in \nmind-body medicine, and I would say I probably coined the phrase. In 1985 I wrote a book \nwhich nobody would accept, no publisher would accept, so I published it on my own, \ncalled Creating Health: Exploring the Mind-Body Connection. The book then was picked up \nby Houghton Mifflin and became at national bestseller. And I wrote another book \ncalled Quantum Healingwhich was vilified by the medical establishment because I was \nbasically proposing, long before anybody was talking about entanglement, I was talking \nabout the entanglement of mind, body, neuropeptides, molecules of emotion, etc., etc., from \nmy own experience. But the books did very well with the lay public. The New England \nJournaldid a good review of Quantum Healing in 1988, but basically I'm still ridiculed for \nit by the regular medical establishment. \nMatt: Were you talking about quantum entanglement \nDeepak: I wasn't using the word quantum entanglement. I was talking about the fact that \nthoughts and molecules are inseparable, basically, and that between a thought and a \nmolecule there's a gap, and that gap is consciousness. It's now 30 years since the book, and \nRudy was my co-author. He's a neuroscientist at Harvard and the head of neuroscience at \nMass General. He wrote the foreword to the reissue of Quantum Healing, which I'll send \nyou, but it's almost now quaint with all that we know of now. But I used that word which \nannoyed a lot of people, including Richard Dawkins, who ridiculed me, and I said, \"Listen, \nI'm using it as a metaphor.\" \nAll science, I was saying, was a metaphor anyway, but it was then that I also got very \ninterested in meditation. And then I went to India, and I spend about 10 years in India \ntalking to these teachers, basically, of consciousness, where consciousness is fundamental \nreality, it is beyond thought or experience, and the word they use is pure consciousness. So I \nwent through an experience with a teacher of meditation who basically asked me questions \nlike I can ask you right now. What is this? [Matt: \"It's a glass.\"] And what's this? [Matt: \n\"Flower.\"] And what's this? [Matt: \"A candle.\"] What's this?\" [Matt: \"A Sharpie.\"] \"What's \nthis?\" [Matt: \"A hand. Did I get them all right?\"] So far. I said the same thing. But I was \nhaving a conversation with somebody, and he said to me, \"Those are human \nconstructs.\" And I was trying to tell this person, who was a meditation teacher, I was telling \nhim about the molecules of emotion. Serotonin. He said they're not real. \nSo that got me thinking, okay, and I seriously went into wanting to experience pure \nconsciousness, which they all talk about, as transcendence, beyond subject-object split. So, \nthis person that I had this conversation with, he said, \"If you were a baby and you had no \nlanguage, not exposed to any language, this would not be a hand. This would be a shape, a \nform, a color, maybe a smell, a texture, a sensation, as an activity of consciousness. But then \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029513 \nyou would be told, This is a hand, you have a body, and then you would have an \ninterpretation of that experience, which you would call a thought. And then you would also \nbe told, This is your body. You have a mind. You're Indian. And you come from a Hindu \nfamily.' All social constructs. Fundamental reality is sensory perception, which is an \nactivation of consciousness, and its interpretation is thought. The rest is a story. Mind, body, \nand even universe is a story.\" Well, that was pretty mind-boggling for a young person at \nthe age of 35. I'd already trained now, here. Slowly, that lead to how one construct leads to \nanother construct. Okay, so this is an iPhone. It's matter. Well I have now reified sensory \nexperience in consciousness, an activity of consciousness in consciousness, with a construct, \niPhone. Then I reify it further, made of matter. And now this is very convenient. I can study \nit. It's made of molecules, made of atoms. So one construct leads to another construct, \nparticles. Then you get ultimately to possibility waves and then you're stuck again. \nOkay [laughter], but along the chain, one construct built to another construct to another \nconstruct to another construct. Very useful. New York City is a construct. Latitude is a \nconstruct. Longitude is a construct. Time is it construct. Money is a construct. Wall Street is \na construct. Religion is a construct. God is a construct. Universe is a construct, which you \ncall a model, Okay. So, this led me to consciousness, exploring consciousness. Where now, \nyou have___you know I just came from this conference, on the science of consciousness, \nwhere you have physicalists, you have dualists, you have panpsychists, you have idealists, \nand they're all arguing about the constructs. \nSo the physicalists are now in a difficult position, because they're trying to explain \nconsciousness with the construct of physicality, and you can't. Because physicality itself is a \nconstruct. Then you have the idealists going back to Plato who are saying it's all mental. But \neven mental ideas are constructs. Then you have the dualists, Descartes, the two are \nseparate, mind and body. But then how do you explain their interaction? It violates simple \nlaws like thermodynamics. If mind is separate and body is separate, how do I lift my arm? I \nstart with a thought so I do this. How do I speak, how do I walk, how do I do anything? So, \ndualism doesn't make me happy. Idealism doesn't make me happy. Physicalism, I don't \nknow what matter is anymore. \nI interviewed the Nobel laureate Wilczek, physicist from MIT. So I said, \"What is \nmatter?\" \"It's particles.\" I said, \"What are particles, subatomic particles?\" He says, \"They are \nlittle things.\" I said, \"But then everybody says that's a wave potential, that's in Hilbert space. \nWhat is that? Where is Hilbert space?\" He says, \"It's mathematical.\" \"What is it?\" \"It's \ninfinitely dimensional or zero dimensional.\" \"Where is it?\" The usual answer is \"Shut up and \ncalculate,\" right? So I realized that the entire new paradigm of multiverse, superstrings, \neternal inflation, whatever, is all in mathematical imagination. Hilbert space is in \nmathematical imagination, the wave potential is in mathematical imagination. I said to \nWilczek, \"What is matter?\" And he said, \"We're still trying to figure that out.\" [Laughter.] I \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029514 \nmean this is coming from a Nobel laureate who discovered a particle, you know. So I \nended up where I began, which is non-dualism, that there is only consciousness. \nMatt: Isn't that idealism? \nDeepak: Idealism comes out of non-dualism. \nMatt: So there are two types of monism [non-dualism]. There's materialism and then there \nis idealism. [Each holds that] there's only matter or there's only consciousness. \nDeepak: Okay then we can say idealism is closest to non-duality. They don't use that word \nin the East. Let's go for lunch. [We head downstairs.] \nDeepak: With idealism one usually relates to Plato in the West or to Bishop Berkeley and \nall those guys, you know. But basically, what idealism espouses, it's mental. But non-\ndualism says even mental is a construct. When you say mental you have words. As soon as \nyou have a word for an experience it's no longer fundamental. \nMatt: Non-dualism is a construct too. \nDeepak: If I have to use words, yes. \nMatt: There's no getting away from constructs. \nDeepak: No, there is a way of getting away from constructs. It's called transcendence. Shut \nup and just be. \nMatt: We never stop filtering experience \nDeepak: Every experience is filtered through given constructs. There is no getting away \nfrom it. But then we start looking at consciousness____let's find our table.
