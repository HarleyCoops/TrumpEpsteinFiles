Kennedy, listed for sale about 90 acres \nof land in Martha's Vineyard, a resort island off the Massachusetts coast. \nTwo waterfront parcels in the town of Aquinnah are on the market -- a 39.5-acre (16-hectare) property \navailable for $20 million, and a 53.5-acre piece for $25 million, according to the listings for 6 Red Gate Farm \nand 8 Red Gate Farm. \n\"An exclusive waterfront property with incredible views of Squibnocket Pond, with further views over \ntowering sand dunes to the Atlantic Ocean,\" the listing for 6 Red Gate Farm reads. \"Plenty of privacy with \nvaried topography and easy pond access. Yours to create a marvelous estate.\" \nThe land is part of a 366-acre stretch that has been private since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis bought it in 1978, \nsaid John O'Connell, broker and owner of Vineyard Realty Group in Edgartown, Massachusetts. \nThe property is \"a piece of the island that very few people have seen,\" said O'Connell, who isn't involved in \nthe sale. \nCorporate records for Red Gate Farm LLC, which owns the land, lists Edwin A. Schlossberg as the person \nresponsible for the parcels. He is the husband of Caroline Kennedy, who is expected to be Obama's choice as \nthe next U.S. ambassador to Japan. \nTo contact the reporter on this story: Prashant Gopal in Boston at \nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kara Wetzel at \nFind out more about Bloomberg for iPad: http://m.bloomberg.com/ipad/  \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
