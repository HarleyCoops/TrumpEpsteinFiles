    "full_text": "﻿CNN – Quest Means Business\nNew Tariffs — Trade War\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn, September 18, 2018\n1\nHOST: Now from Beijing, Robert\nLawrence Kuhn is a long-time\nadvisor to China's leaders and the\nauthor of “How China's Leaders\nThink”. Thank you so much for\njoining us. We appreciate it. Your\nreaction to Jack Ma's prediction and\ndo you agree?\nRLK: The public stance of China has\nto be strong. The legitimacy of the\ngovernment and of the Communist\nParty is based on two primary\nfactors. One is the economic\ndevelopment.\nRLK: China is celebrating this year\n40 years of reform and opening up\nreally having created an economic\nmiracle, an astonishing 50 times\nincrease of GDP per capita. So that\nhas been terrific. The second area is\nnational pride and national\nrejuvenation. And frankly, China as\nalmost every other country, if the\ntwo come into conflict, the latter\nhas to prevail, especially in China\nwith a history of 100 years of\nbullying, as they say, by foreign\npowers, mostly Western, and then\nof course Japan.\n2\nRLK: This has caused a deep scar in\nthe Chinese psyche. So you have all\nof these factors coming together —\nbut I can tell you the public stance\nof the government, of Jack Ma we\njust heard, is very strong and they\nhave to be.\nRLK: If you look at what President\nTrump said, that is not a public\nposture for seeking solution. Not\njust saying tariffs will go up to 25\npercent in January will go up, but\nthen threatening if you retaliate at\nall, we're going to levy tariffs on\neverything else [$500+ billion\nChinese goods]. That's a very\naggressive stance and China really\nhas no choice.\n3\nRLK: But behind the scenes, I\ntalked to economists, the leading\neconomists officials, every day.\nEverybody wants a solution and\nthey want it a lot sooner than 20\nyears. But number one, they have\nto have a government in\nWashington that are people they\ncan talk to, that they will have\nconfidence that what they say will\nbe implemented. And the Chinese\nwant a solution because many of\nthe problems, if we look at the\nproblems, solutions are consonant\nwith what China needs itself,\nopening up markets further is one\nof them.\nRLK: Economists tell me all the time\nthat China needs to open markets.\nThat more competitiveness within\nChina — that’s good for China, but\nthey can't look like they're\nsubservient or bowing to foreign\npressures. We can go through each\nof the issues that are critical: China\nhas made progress in intellectual\nproperty. Is it perfect? Of course\nnot, but they know they really need\nto improve that. They will reduce\nforced technology transfer.\n4\nRLK: What they will not do is\nchange their industrial model,\nwhich is government support for\nfuture industries. So that's a\nsticking point, but I believe that\nthey will open their markets further\nand this is critical.\nHOST: So how do you find\ncompromise when on the one hand,\nas you've described, you've got a\ncountry that wants to come across\nas a superpower equal to that of\nthe United States, so any\nconcessions would make them look\nweak. On the other hand, there's\nnot much love lost for China here.\nHOST: In the United States, as you\nknow, Republicans and Democrats\nalike, some that may not even\nagree with most of President's\nTrump's policies can't go out\nnecessarily and throw their arms\naround China and support China\nopenly to the voters. So where do\nyou come up with a middle ground\nto where both sides look like\nthey're walking away with\nsomething?\n5\nRLK: Certainly that's the objective.\nYou're absolutely right: There's no\nissue in American politics that the\nall sides of the spectrum agree\nupon more than on China. In fact,\non every other issue, one could say\nfrom the Bernie Sanders / Elizabeth\nWarren, Democrats on the left, to\nDonald Trump Republicans on the\nfar right, they disagree on virtually\neverything we can say except on\nChina. So that's the reality we are\ndealing with.\nRLK: Nobody expects this to be\nresolved before the midterm\nelections. That's for sure. But if we\nlook at the details, if the people\nwho really know what's going on\nlook at the detail, we look at the\nreal issues, we have the trade\ndeficit, sure, but most people in the\nU.S recognize that it's a simplistic\nnumber.\n6\nRLK: The trade deficit has a lot of\nthings in there that are not\naccurate. You look at the iPhone,\nChina will get 6, 10 percent of\nthat, the rest are components that\ngo into China. Services are 40\nbillion dollars — what Chinese\ntourists and students pay in the\nUS — not counted in the trade\ndeficit, which is a very\ncomplicated number. It also\nbenefits the US because we have a\nlot of good products at cheaper\nprices.\nRLK: But there are five real\nreasons that are problematic to\nthe US with respect to China:\nclosed markets; intellectual\nproperty protection; industrial\nespionage, which includes cyber\ntheft; forced technology transfer\nin JVs; and government support\nfor future industries. Those are\nfive real issues that the smart\npeople in America are focusing on.\nAnd legitimately so.\n7\nRLK: But there are five real\nreasons that are problematic to\nthe US with respect to China:\nclosed markets; intellectual\nproperty protection; industrial\nespionage, which includes cyber\ntheft; forced technology transfer\nin JVs; and government support\nfor future industries. Those are\nfive real issues that the smart\npeople in America are focusing on.\nAnd legitimately so.\nRLK: But these are, I believe,\nsolvable — because intellectual\nproperty rights, China's\nimproving. Industrial espionage,\nthey're reducing and they have\nreduced. It needs to be more.\nTech transfer, I think that will be\neliminated.\nRLK: The two critical issues are\ngovernment support of nascent\nindustries in China and the\nopening of markets. I think\nultimately those two can be\ntraded. The US can recognize that\nChina can do some of those things\nwith certain restrictions and really\nopen their markets more. I think\nthat's the ultimate trade.\n8\nHOST: As you\nmentioned, it's\na long-term\nprocess, not\nanything we're\ngoing to see\nresolved in the\nnext few\nmonths or even\nyears. Though\nmany people\nwould say it\nwould be\neasier from the\nAmerican\nperspective if\nthe president\nwasn't\napproaching it\nas I go it alone,\na type of\nrelationship\nand getting out\nof TPP. But\nthat's for\nanother\nconversation.\nRobert, we\nappreciate you\njoining us.\n9\n"
