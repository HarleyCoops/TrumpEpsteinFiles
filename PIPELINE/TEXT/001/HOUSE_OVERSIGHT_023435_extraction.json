    "full_text": "﻿PROPOSAL: Poetry in America for Middle and High School Teachers\nA. NATURE OF THE REQUEST\nPoetry in America, a collaboration between Elisa New and Programs in Professional\nEducation (PPE) at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE), will produce courses\nfor national and international distribution to K­12 teachers. Drawing on Elisa New’s extensive\narchive of raw instructional video, HGSE has the goal of providing online graduate­level\nprofessional development courses for teachers who have never before had the opportunity to\nadvance their careers online. Teachers will be able to use to this course to strengthen their\nclassroom practice while accumulating credits toward advanced degrees in education.\nThough American teachers are required to take professional development courses, very few\nof these courses offer teachers content support. This initiative will provide such support at a\nhigh level, offering Harvard credits and career advancement to participating teachers.\nAdditionally, this initiative will produce classroom­ready video content designed to engage and\neducate middle and high school students, thus enabling teachers to bring the content of their\nprofessional development directly into the classroom. It will give teachers the confidence and\ntools to discuss poetry while also meeting English Language Arts standards and providing\nteachers with professional development opportunities. The first such course, Poetry of the\nCity, is already in active development, with its first one­credit module, on the poetry of Walt\nWhitman, currently entering the post­production stage. The second proposed course (either\n“The Poetry of Character Development and the Feelings” ­­concerned with building literacy\nskills and character awareness­­ or “The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky” ­­concerned with\nmaking connections between science and poetry) will enter post­production as soon as funds\nbecome available.\nIn addition to the production team (including an executive director, video editor, media\nmanager, and instructional designer), we are joined by a diverse set of senior partners\nincluding:\n● James Ryan, Dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education\n● Mary Grassa O’Neill, Managing Director of HGSE Professional Education and former\nsuperintendent of the Archdiocese of Boston and Milton Public Schools\n● Roland Fryer, Henry Lee Professor of Economics at Harvard, Macarthur “Genius,”\nand founder of the Education Innovation Laboratory\n● Robert Polito, American academic, critic, poet, and President of The Poetry\nFoundation.\nOur advisory board includes:\n● US Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky\n● Actor John Lithgow\n● Hip­Hop Artist Nas\n● distinguished academics and poets from Harvard and elsewhere\nParticipants and Filmed Conversations include:\n● President Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock, poet Sonia Sanchez, and children from the\nHarlem Children’s Zone on disappointment and discrimination (filmed in Harlem and\nLA)\n● Nas on traditions of American urban long­form poetry\n● Lena Dunham on truth­telling and romantic love (filmed in Brooklyn)\n● Woody Allen on poetry, sincerity, and morality\n● Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan on poetry and the law\n● Vice President Al Gore on poetry and the environment\n● Robert Frost biographer Jay Parini with Harvard students on trauma (filmed in\nVermont)\n● Alfre Woodard on Gwendolyn Brooks and rebellion\n● Senator John McCain on love and loyalty to comrades (filmed in Washington DC)\n● Katie Couric on grief and self­control\n● NBA athletes Shane Battier and Jason Collins on form and basketball\nB. PROJECT ACTIVITIES\nThe activities of this proposal fall into three major categories: production, post­production, and\ndistribution. The activities involve collaboration between academics, professional course\ndevelopers, curricular designers and video producers.\nPoetry in America has amassed well over one hundred hours of high quality instructional\nvideo, including dozens of interpretive conversations with well­known personalities across the\nprofessions. Some additional production is expected, and a crew is now assembled to\naccomplish additional production in a cost effective manner. The post­production stage will\ninvolve discussion and planning with the Harvard Graduate School of Education and other\neducational and media partners based on this current sizeable archive of raw video footage.\nAt the post­production stage, we will shape and edit the raw footage into curricular content for\nteachers, and produce classroom­ready video. The post­production team, led by an\nexperienced course developer and producer, will also include a professional\nvideographer/editor with experience in creating high­quality pedagogy, a media manager, and\na curriculum design team comprised of an instructional designer and IT specialist. HGSE will\ndevelop graduate course materials, including classroom­usable lesson plans, based on video\ncontent. Courses offered will include uncoached, lightly coached and fully coached versions of\nteaching poetry in the classroom. Teachers enrolled in coached versions of the course will\nreceive real­time classroom support by HGSE instructional staff.\nThe distribution phase will rely heavily on our media and educational partners. Distribution\nemanates from PPE, which attracts thousands of educators every year to its programs on\nHarvard’s campus, and enrolls thousands of others in its highly successful WIDE World\ncourses. Previous offerings of Poetry in America courses on edX have attracted over 25,000\nlearners worldwide.\nOther partners include:\n● The Poetry Foundation\n● WGBH\n● The Atlantic\n● The Aspen Institute\n● The Nantucket Project\n● Genius\n● Nautilus\n● The Big Think\n● The Emily Dickinson Museum\nNew corporate partners include:\n● Digital Partners Incorporated\n● Adobe\n● Netsuite\nC: OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES\nThis project will eventuate in for­credit professional development materials, developed by the\nHarvard Graduate School of Education to support relevant educational standards, including\nbut not limited to the Common Core. With funds sufficient to the task, we expect to release\ntwo full­credit courses for teachers by Spring 2016. HGSE has a business plan to produce\nthese courses, which they expect will fill a market niche.\nD: FUNDING OPTIONS\nFunds to support Poetry in America for Middle and High School Teachers may be directed to\nthe Harvard Graduate School of Education. There is an HGSE account dedicated to Poetry in\nAmerica that is ready to receive donations.\nAlternatively, funds can be donated to Filmmaker’s Collaborative, a 501c3 dedicated to\nsupporting independent film and media initiatives such as the Poetry in America project.\nFilmmaker’s Collaborative provides low­cost fiscal sponsorship for over 200 media projects\nacross the country, and also offers professional support and public programming. Filmmakers\nCollaborative allows maximum autonomy and flexibility in the use of resources to support the\nobjectives of the Poetry in America project.\n"
