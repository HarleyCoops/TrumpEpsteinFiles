Would let you sound smart and offer what \nI think would be a crowd-pleasing perspective, and make you seem like a credible player--former friend of \nTrump, advisor to world leaders, sought after person, etc--without having to too much rehash old stuff. \nDoesn't seem like they can win...but who knows. I'm meeting Bannon had 3 tomorrow and will stay with him \nuntil the end. \nOn Mon, Nov 5, 2018 at 2:08 PM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nif the republicans pull this off, steve would deserve most of the credit. . he was way out in front on this way \nout. .. execution not to his liking but on another note , what were you thinking about me in the \nbook, with what moniker \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
