What Can We Do About It?\nNotes\nAbout the Author\nPreface\nMy father always told me that I would be a teacher. He didn’t mean\nit in a nice way. My father talked in riddles. As the only child in the\nhouse, I had plenty of time and opportunity to figure out what he was\nreally saying. This was it: I am afraid that like me, the best you will be\nable to do in life is to be a civil service worker. He was also saying: If he\nhad realized he was going to be a civil service worker, at least he could\nhave been a teacher, which he might have enjoyed. He wasn’t really\ntalking about me at all.\nI never had any intention of being a teacher. I didn’t particularly\nlike school and later, when I became a professor, the part of the job I\ndisliked the most was the teaching. One might wonder how I wound\nup being a professor if I disliked teaching, and one might wonder why\nI am writing a book about teaching if I dislike teaching. One also might\nwonder whether I still dislike teaching. Yes. And no. It depends on what\none means by teaching, which is, after all, what this book is about.\nThe other day my 3-year-old grandson Milo told me he was going\nto teach me how to throw rocks. It seemed an odd idea. What could he\nmean by this? To Milo, “teach” means to tell someone what to do and\nhow to do it and then have the person do it too. Teach is part of tell\nplus imitate for Milo. Milo is 3. It is not too surprising that this is what\nteach means to him. It is a little surprising that he thinks he should\nbe his grandfather’s teacher, but that is another issue. But it is really\nno shock that Milo thinks this is what teach means. It is what nearly\neveryone thinks teach means. The commonly accepted usage of teach\nis tell and then have the person who was told, do what he was told.\nThis certainly is not what teach ought to mean, or more important, is\nnot what good teaching is. And, every good teacher knows this. The\nproblem is that the system that employs teachers doesn’t know it and\nmore or less insists that Milo’s definition be the one that is followed.\nActually, I am being too generous here. Milo’s view, namely, that\nafter he tells me, I will do what he has said, is a better definition of\nix\nx\nPreface\nteaching than the one actually employed commonly today. Milo at\nleast thinks that the end result will be the student doing something\nthat the teacher did. In school, teach usually means helping the student\nto know something that the teacher told him. Milo doesn’t know\nabout that definition of teaching yet since he hasn’t been to school,\nbut, unfortunately, he soon will.\nI have been thinking about teaching for more than 50 years. First\nI thought about it when my father said that was what I was going to\nbe. Then I thought about it as I watched my teachers teach me and, no\nless important, watched my father teach me.\nMy father eventually retired from his civil service job and became\na junior high school teacher in Harlem. He loved his new job and, I\nhave to assume, became a good teacher. I say it that way because he\nwas certainly not a good teacher for me, at least not when he thought\nhe was trying to teach me. I remember him trying to teach me algebra\nand it making no sense to me whatever. I remember him teaching me\nsports and I mostly think of him as being totally frustrated with my\ninability to perform as well as he had hoped. (Being a jock was a big\nthing to my father.)\nI did fine in algebra without his help and, in fact, became a math\nmajor in college. But, as I look back at it, my father was my first and\nbest teacher. Why do I say this after all the bad things I have just said?\nBecause my father was at his best when he wasn’t teaching but was\njust saying what was on his mind and arguing. He often talked about\nhistory because he liked history. And when he talked about history\nand I asked questions, he became a good Socratic teacher. He forced\nme to think and question in our discussions. The conversations were\noften very heated but also were a highlight of my intellectual life at\nthat time. My father didn’t teach me anything except how to think.\nThat’s better than algebra, actually. For this I am grateful.\nSo, I thought about teaching then and I thought about it again\nwhen I went to college. As part of my father’s conversations with\nme about life, he talked a great deal about his own experiences. His\nmother sent him to New York City to live with his aunt in Brooklyn\nand to go to college. He was 15 and had, until that time, spent his\nentire life on a farm/hotel run by his parents in upstate New York.\nHe was unprepared for the city, had no money, missed his family,\nand had no idea why he wanted to go to college at all. Did I mention\nthat he was 15? He had graduated first in his class (a class of 16, I\nPreface\nxi\nthink) and had skipped a few grades on the way. Suddenly he found\nhimself at New York University, which in those days was located in\nthe Bronx.\nThis is what he remembered most about college in 1923: Apart\nfrom the poverty stories, the “how hard he had to work to support\nhimself” stories, the stories about watching the Yankees from the elevated\ntrain and wishing he could go to a game, he remembered that\nteachers lectured, that you had to memorize what they told you and\nthen tell it back to them on a test. He thought college was stupid, but\nhe assured me (in 1960) that college surely had changed by now and\nthat teachers wouldn’t still be doing this. Oh yeah? In 1962, when I\nentered college, they were doing exactly that. And, in 2000, when I\nretired from 32 years of professoring, not that much had changed.\nSo I was thinking about teaching before I got to college and I was\nthinking about it while I was a professor and I am thinking about it\nnow that I have, for the most part, finished teaching. To make sure I\nhave been thinking about it correctly, I asked former Ph.D. students of\nmine, (now tenured professors mostly and some industry executives)\nwhat they had learned from me while they were spending 4–7 years\nstudying with me. I thought their answers might help me think about\nteaching in a new way. I sent an e-mail to maybe 20 former students\nwhose e-mail addresses I happened to have, and most responded. Here\nare some excerpts.\n1. I remember quite specifically a homework presentation I\nmade in your class. When I presented it in class, I was a junior\nin college, and all the other students in that class were grad\nstudents. When I was done you smiled at everyone (a rare\nevent) and said, “Anyone care to follow that act?” Your clearly\nheartfelt endorsement of my little research product was a key\nmoment in my coming to trust my own ideas. I just submitted\na $16.7 million proposal to NIH that would create the first allcomputational\ngenome center. The kind of chutzpah embodied\nin that proposal is one consequence of my experience with you.\n2. The way you assigned me to a project—you sent me to each\nexisting project for 2 weeks until I hit on a project with a good\nfit (I was enthusiastic and coherent talking about it). I used this\ntechnique when I was assigning people at Accenture.\nxii\nPreface\n3. You taught me to teach by telling students stories that are\nmeaningful to you. I think to be a real teacher you have to let\nyourself be vulnerable. So the students can see that you are a\nhuman with feelings and fears and goals. And then being able\nto say to the students: This is the way I do it; it fits who I am; it\nhelps me be successful; and don’t let anyone tell you that you\ncan’t do something.\n4. You taught me that not everyone will like you no matter what\nyou do and no matter how hard you try. I came back from a\nDeloitte course evaluation, and the deans just hated me. Instead\nof being upset with me, you assured me that you have to just say\nwhat you believe, and some people won’t like you, and oh well.\n5. You taught me to start by collecting data. I recall watching\nmost of your papers start by collection of data. I recall watching\nyour criticisms of work that was just abstraction on abstraction,\nwith no data at its roots.\n6. You once told me to imagine that my mother was my\naudience—if I could explain it to my mother, I could explain it\nto anyone. Incredibly, this seems to work for every audience out\nthere. So I’ve passed that tip along to my students and it seems to\nwork for them too.\n7. I remember that you used to tell us we need to be excited to\nget up and go to work in the morning, that that was the most\nimportant thing. For some people, it’s because of the people\nyou will be with. For some, it is because of the passion about\nwhatever it is. But, in general, I still give people that advice (and\nit is advice I’ve also been giving my own kids). You have to love\nwhat you are doing.\nThis is just a sample but it reflects what these former students, now\nall in their 40s and 50s, remember about what I taught them. Hadn’t\nthey learned any facts from me? Didn’t I teach them some real stuff?\nSome said in passing that they had learned the actual content of the\nsubjects I taught as well, but that that wasn’t as important to them as\nthe things they chose to write about. Why not?\nPreface\nxiii\nThere are two important answers to this question and those answers\nare what this book is really about. My father offered these same\nanswers to me, not explicitly by any means, when I thought about the\ngood and bad of having him as my teacher. When he tried to teach me\nfacts, I learned nothing much. When he engaged my mind, I learned a\nlot. As a professor I never forgot this lesson. I rarely tried to teach facts,\nupsetting many a student along the way. I just argued with them, or\nencouraged them. I never told them much, except maybe some good\nstories.\nSo here are the answers:\nThe first is:\nTeaching isn’t what outsiders to the profession think it is.\nThe profession I am referring to here is, of course, the teaching\nprofession.\nThe second is:\nLearning isn’t what outsiders to the profession think it is.\nIn this case, the profession I am referring to is not teaching at all.\nLet’s start with teaching.\nA professor friend of mine once asked her class what they thought\na professor’s biggest fear was while teaching a class. They all agreed\nit was not knowing the answer to a question a student might ask.\nWhen she told this story to a group of professors, they all laughed\nout loud.\nWhy am I telling this story? Because a student’s view of teaching\nvaries greatly from a teacher’s view. No teacher worries about not\nknowing the right answer to something a student will ask. You can\nalways fake it (say—What do you think? or, Class, can you help here?) if\nyou think it is important, but answers don’t matter very much. Teachers\nare not supposed to be encyclopedias. They are supposed to be\nsomething else. The question is: What?\nMy students’ responses above give a hint. Teachers are supposed\nto be people who help students find their interests in life, think about\nxiv\nPreface\nhow to make decisions, understand how to approach a problem, or\notherwise live sensibly. Teachers are never shocked to be asked to provide\npersonal or professional advice to a student having a problem—\nany problem. If one takes one’s job seriously, teaching means being\navailable to help. But this important advisory job is confused by lesson\nplans, and class hours, and lectures, none of which matter very much.\nWhy do I say that these things don’t matter very much? This is the\nessence of what this book is about—the move from content-based instruction\nto cognitive-based learning, assisted by good teaching. This\nmeans we will have to define this “new” kind of learning (it’s not really\nnew, of course, just new to schools) and the “new” kind of teaching\nthat is a natural consequence of using this new learning method.\nMost teachers understand and appreciate that delivering the required\nmaterial is not their real job, at least it is not the reason they\nsigned on in the first place. The employers of teachers, on the other\nhand—administrators, governments, department heads, and so on—\nexpect certain material to be covered. Exciting students is not on their\nworry list. This is a big problem for teachers and for students, and one\nthat we will address here.\nBut my more serious concern is our conception of learning, not\nteaching. Teaching follows one’s conception of learning so getting\nlearning right is of prime importance. When I said earlier that outsiders\nto the learning profession wouldn’t get the real point, I was being\nironic. There is no learning profession. Why not?\nIn 1989, I moved from Yale to Northwestern to establish a new\ninstitute, funded by Andersen Consulting, devoted to issues of changing\ntraining and education by the use of new technologies. I needed a\nname for the institute and came up with The Institute for the Learning\nSciences. I made up the term learning sciences. There was no such field\nin academia. Most people thought I meant we were planning to work\non how people learned science. The only academic fields that “studied”\nlearning were psychology and education. Psychology, being an\nexperimental field, allows faculty to work only on experiments about\nlearning that provide data in a controlled environment. Education\nfaculty study how schools work and very rarely think about learning\noutside of the school context or in a way different from the paradigm\nalready extant in schools. I wanted to create a learning profession. In\n1989, there certainly didn’t seem to be one.\nPreface\nxv\nToday this is less true. Cognitive science, a field I also had a big\npart in creating, has become more important in the academic world.\nTraining, and e-learning, the first new field to come about as a result\nof our work at my new institute (for better or for worse, I am not too\nfond of most e-learning work) have become more important to think\nabout within the academic context, in part because online courses are\nseen as potential revenue producers.\nSo, while there is still no learning profession per se, there is much\ninterest in what learning is about. This book is meant to address the\nissue of what learning really is, in or out of school, and to answer the\nquestion: How does learning really work? The questions that follow\nfrom the answer to that question are:\n• What kinds of learning situations occur naturally?\n• How can we focus education (and training and\ne-learning) on those types of situations in a new\nparadigm?\n• What would teaching look like in this new paradigm?\n• If what we know about how learning works is antithetical\nto how school works, then what can we do?\nAnswering these questions is one goal of this book.\nAnother goal of this book is to think seriously about what it means\nto teach. Typically, we look at teaching in precisely the way that our\nsystem forces us to look at it. There are subjects and there are experts,\nand experts talk about their subjects to students who listen to what\nthey have to say. This idea is not only archaic—it is wrong. In the history\nof humankind, teaching could never have looked this way.\nUntil recently, teaching always meant apprenticeship. We are set\nup to be apprentices, to learn by doing with help from a mentor. We\nhave done this since the beginning of time. When learning became\nacademic in nature, when students were expected to become scholars,\nall this changed—and it didn’t change for the better. Teaching started\nto mean talking, and talking is a terrible way to teach. People aren’t\nreally that good at listening, after all. Small children don’t listen to\ntheir parents. They may copy their parents. They can be corrected by\ntheir parents. They may be impeded from doing something by their\nparents. But listen? Not really. We listen in order to be entertained, not\nin order to learn.\nxvi\nPreface\nThis lack of understanding about what learning really is like, and\nwhat teaching must be like in order to be useful, has caused us to set\nup school in a way that really does not work very well. When students\ncomplain about school, when politicians say school isn’t working, we\nunderstand that there is a problem. But we don’t understand what\nthe problem is. We think we can fix schools by making them more\nfriendly, or safer, or paying teachers better, or having students have\nmore say, or obsessing about test scores, but none of this is the case.\nThe problem with schools lies in our conception of the role of\nschool. We see school as a place to study academics, to become a\nscholar, when in fact very few students actually want to become scholars\nor study academics.\nAs a society we have gotten caught up in a conception of school\nfrom the late 1800s that has failed to change in any significant way,\ndespite the fact that universal education has made the system unstable.\nUniversities dominate the discussion, and everyone listens to\nwhat academics have to say because they don’t see the alternative or\nknow whom else to listen to. But, if we understand how learning actually\nworks, and how teaching actually should work, the alternative\nbecomes much clearer.\nIt is establishing that clarity that is my goal in this book.\nCHAPTER 1\nCognitive Process-Based Education\nEducation is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember\nfrom time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be\ntaught.\n—Oscar Wilde\nLearning begins with a goal. However, when we think about education\nand school, we often forget this. Someone, somewhere, decides that a\nstudent must learn about Napoleon, but fails to ask how such learning\nmight conform to a goal that the student consciously holds. We don’t\nforget this when we try to teach a child to walk or talk, because we\nknow that the child does want to learn to do these things. When we\nteach a child to hit a baseball, we usually determine beforehand that\nthe child wants to learn to do this. But, we forget this simple idea of\ngoal-directed learning as soon as we design curricula for schools. Who\ncares if the child wants to learn long division? Make the child learn it.\nIt is very important. Full speed ahead!\nSomewhere along the way, many students get lost. They may get\nlost in high school, or in college, or in job training. But somewhere\nthey learn to shut off their natural learning instincts, the ones that\ndrive them to improve because they really want to accomplish something.\nInstead they try hard to do what they were told to do—they\nstudy, they pass tests, and eventually their love of learning is gone.\nThe feedback that they previously have gotten from accomplishing a\nreal goal, one that they truly had held, has been replaced by pleasing\nthe teacher, or getting a good grade, or progress in their goal of getting\ninto a “good college.”\nDesigners (and teachers) of courses must contend with this truth:\nThe students that you have may not want to learn what it is that you\nwant to teach.\nWhat to do?\n1\n2 Teaching Minds\nFirst, we must establish whether students can learn whatever it\nis that you want to teach. I always wanted to teach my daughter to\nthrow a ball properly. She threw a football astonishingly well at the\nage of 6. But, she never got it about how to throw a softball. I don’t\nknow why. She just couldn’t learn to do it right. She can’t do math\neither. Believe me, I tried.\nSecond, we must determine whether what you want to teach can\nbe taught. Not everything can be taught. It is hard to learn to be a\nnice guy if you are inclined to be nasty. You can learn to be nicer, or\nat least to fake it, perhaps, but certain things are hard to learn after\na certain age. You can teach a 2-year-old to be nice—a 22-year-old is\nanother story.\nThird, we must figure out what method of learning actually would\nteach what we want to teach. This is an important question that is\nmade more important, in part, by the fact that the learning methods\navailable in schools tend to be of a certain type. The things that\nschools desire to teach are of a type that conforms to the available\nmethodologies for teaching. Content that lies outside the range of the\ncurrently available methodologies typically is not considered something\nworth teaching.\nFourth, we must decide whether a selected learning methodology\nactually will work, given the time constraints and abilities of the students,\nand other constraints that actually exist. This is, of course, the\nreal problem in education. It is easy to say that students would learn\nbetter if they had real experiences to draw upon. This isn’t that hard to\nfigure out. What is hard is implementing this idea within the time constraints\nof the school day and the other demands of the school year.\nFifth, we must determine a way that will make what you want to\nteach fit more closely with real-life goals that your students actually\nmay have. By real-life goals I mean things like walking and talking\n(and later driving). Why is it that teachers, or more accurately school\nsystems and governments, want to teach things that are not in accord\nwith a student’s real interest? While we argue about how best to\nteach algebra, no one ever asks what to do if a student doesn’t want to\nlearn algebra. The question is so weird; the possibility that you could\nskip algebra because it doesn’t interest you is so remote that we don’t\neven think about this in any way. What is the real cause of this problem?\nWhy can’t we just let students learn what interests them? Are the\npeople who run schools simply out of touch with how learning really\nworks or how actual students behave when faced with something they\nCognitive Process-Based Education 3\ndon’t want to learn, or is something else more complex going on?\nI will summarize these five issues as follows:\nABILITY\nPOSSIBILITY\nMETHODOLOGY\nCONSTRAINTS\nGOAL ALIGNMENT\nSchool is subject-based and, further, those subjects are predefined and\nagreed upon by those in charge. Without giving a history of how this\nstate of affairs came to be, 1 or why it is an issue, it is first necessary to\nnote that it is the case. I say this because when we were students in\nschool, we accepted the fact that school was the way it was, and we\nassumed that it was the way it was supposed to be. We may not think\neach subject we learn is valuable or interesting, and perhaps we long\nto learn different subjects, but never do we hear people suggest that\nthere shouldn’t be subjects in school at all. This is a very difficult idea\nto swallow. There have always been subjects. What else would there\nbe? What would it mean to not have subjects?\nAnswering this question is the aim of this book. We need to understand\nwhat goes on in schools and what might be preferable. The issue\nreally is not schooling at all. The real issue is how learning actually\ntakes place in the human mind.\nAsk a student how he is doing in school and he will tell you the\nsubjects he likes. I like English but I am bad at math, he might say. This\nis such a normal sentiment among students that we never think about\nhow weird a sentiment it really is. We don’t ask: How are you doing at\nlife? We could ask that of a teenager and she might say: I am good at\ndating but bad at driving.\nBut, actually, you would never hear teenagers say something like\nthat. This is weird because, in general, dating and driving are much\nmore important subjects in a teenager’s world than English and math.\nBut they don’t talk about whether they are good at it or bad at it in\nthe same way.\nThey continue to practice and get better at those things because\nthey care about them. Saying, I am bad at math, means, in essence,\n. . . and I don’t care and have stopped trying because I don’t see the point.\nSaying, I am good at English, typically means, I am getting a good grade\nin English. This state of affairs defines the main problem in education:\n4 Teaching Minds\nThere are subjects that are school subjects and there are subjects\nthat are life subjects and teenagers can tell the difference. They\nwork harder at the life subjects.\nAnd, what is the difference between these two kinds of subjects? Goals.\nIt is as simple as that.\nInstead of simply saying what is wrong with schools and what\nteenagers are really like in school, I want to take a different tack.\nSome teenagers wake up in the morning wanting to learn history\nor algebra but they are a very small minority of the school population.\nThere is no minority, however, when it comes to dating or driving for\nteenagers. They all want to do these things. So the question I want to\nask is:\nAre there other things that all teenagers want to do and are those\nthings connected in some way with learning?\nOr, to put this another way, if school had been designed around\nsomething other than subjects, what would it have been designed\naround? Driving and dating, which we know are winners in a teenager’s\nworld, could be seen as subjects, or they could be seen as instances\nof something else, and that something else might be something\nimportant to learn.\nStudents everywhere might want to learn whatever that is and they\nwould work hard to learn it. If we can turn the question around in that\nway, maybe we can design better learning situations for everybody.\nSo, the question is:\nWhat are driving and dating instances of, with respect to learning?\nOr, to address this from the cognitive science point of view:\nWhat is it that students are doing when they learn to drive\nand date that they might be getting better at while doing those\nthings?\nCan we view whatever it is they are getting better at as an example\nof the kinds of things we should want to teach and that students\nshould want to learn? Answering these questions will allow us to\nCognitive Process-Based Education 5\nlook at education in a new way. We need to think about how people\nactually learn, regardless of the subject, in order to address them.\nLet’s think about dating, then. I was never any good at it as a kid.\nI know how the non-cool guys feel. But, later on, much later on, I got\nvery good at it. So, I must have learned something. What?\nWhat was I bad at as a kid? Meeting girls, for one thing. Other kids\ncould do it easily. I always needed to be fixed up.\nTalking to girls, for another. I hardly knew any girls. I went to an\nall-boys high school. I was 16 when I went to college and the other\nfreshmen were 18, so that didn’t help either. In other words, I had no\nconfidence.\nBut mostly, I had no idea what to say to a girl. What did they talk\nabout?\nAnd, one more thing. I really didn’t get the point. I didn’t know\nwhy one wanted to go out with girls anyway. I mean I eventually got\nthe idea, at least I think I did.\nWhy am I saying it this way? I am trying to get an insight into the\nlearning process and I am a fine example. I didn’t know how to do it\nand then I did. I didn’t get the point and then I did, sort of. So I must\nhave learned something between the ages of 16 and 60. What?\nHere are some things I learned:\n• Human relationships are important, but they aren’t easy\nto establish or maintain. They require work.\n• The work involves, among other things, learning how to\nlisten and respond to the needs of another human being.\nIt involves subjugating one’s own interests from time to\ntime for the interests of another.\n• Girls, and later women, feel good. Being with someone\nwho loves you feels good. Learning to love feels good.\nMore than feeling good, these things are critical for\nstaying alive. This is not so obvious when you are\nsurrounded by love from your family. But eventually you\nare alone, and alone is not so much fun.\nAs this is not a chapter on love, I will stop there. Suffice it to say\nthat I learned how to meet girls, how to gain their interest, and how to\nform relationships with them. I also learned why I wanted to do that.\nNow let’s see what we have learned about learning from my little\ndiversion into teenage angst.\n6 Teaching Minds\nWe have learned that learning about how other people behave is\nvery important.\nWe have learned that learning about one’s own emotions and\nfeelings is very important.\nWe have learned that building confidence is very important.\nWe have learned that learning to listen is very important.\nWe also have learned that learning how to express oneself is very\nimportant.\nNow let’s go back to discussing learning.\nWhy is it that teenagers are more interested in thinking about dating\nthan they are in thinking about algebra? Why is it that they don’t\nrate themselves on their success in dating in the same way as they do\nwhen they are discussing how they are doing in science?\nWhat do teenagers know about learning that their school doesn’t\nknow?\nThis is it:\nTeenagers know that the issues I have mentioned above will be\nimportant for them for the rest of their lives in a large variety of\narenas, not just dating.\nNo matter what they do in life they will need to form relationships,\nassess their own abilities, gain confidence through practice, learn to\nlisten, learn to love, try things out and see how well they work, and\nlearn why they do what they do. To put this another way:\nDating is way more important than algebra and every teenager\nknows it.\nDating is much more important not because teenagers have raging\nhormones and they crave sex, as this phenomenon often is described.\nIt is important because what they learn while dating serves them in\nmany areas in life and relates strongly to who they will be and how\nwell their lives will go.\nAlgebra relates to none of this and they know that too.\nSo, let me ask a simple question:\nIf we must have subjects in school, why wouldn’t dating be rated\nas way more important than mathematics?\nCognitive Process-Based Education 7\nThe answer to this is simple enough. School was not designed to help\nkids live better lives. That was never the point. But shouldn’t it be? 2\nFrom a cognitive growth point of view, school wasn’t even designed\nto teach us things that relate to learning per se.\nScholars designed the subject matter of the current school system.\nYou hear sportscasters describe football players as scholar-athletes. Really?\nScholars? Why would that be what we are seeking to create? There\nare only so many jobs for scholars, and while scholarship is very nice,\nit ought not be the goal we seek in school in a system of universal\neducation.\nYes, but dating? Is that the subject I am proposing? Really?\nLet me explain the real issue here. Take a look at the items I\nmentioned above.\nWe have learned that learning about how other people behave is\nvery important.\nWe have learned that learning about one’s own emotions and\nfeelings is very important.\nWe have learned that building confidence is very important.\nWe have learned that learning to listen is very important.\nWe also have learned that learning how to express oneself is very\nimportant.\nNow, I will transform these slightly:\nStudents need to learn about how other people behave and why,\nand they need to learn how to interact with different kinds of\npeople.\nStudents need to learn about their own emotions and feelings\nand how to deal with them.\nStudents need to learn how to rely on themselves and feel\nconfident in their own abilities.\nStudents need to learn how to listen to others and really hear\nwhat they are saying.\nStudents need to learn how to express themselves effectively.\nNow this list doesn’t seem so crazy, does it? In fact, most parents will\ntell you that they try very hard to teach all these things to their children.\nSo one argument might be that the school doesn’t have to do it,\nsince parents do it.\n8 Teaching Minds\nAnother argument might be that if the schools worked on these\nissues, they would have students memorize the 12 principles for building\nself-confidence and learn to express themselves by analyzing classics\nin world literature.\nHere is the key point:\nThese issues, the ones that could be learned from dating,\ntranscend all aspects of our lives.\nAnd, more important, students know this. I started with the idea that\nlearning begins with a goal. The points I listed above are goals that\nteenagers actually have. They would not have to be talked into those\ngoals. Moreover those goals are, as all students know anyway, way\nmore important than algebra. They aren’t interested in becoming\nscholars.\nNow let’s consider the cognitive science behind this. Everything\nwe do as human beings is goal-directed. We go for a walk for a reason,\nwe shower for a reason, we get a job for a reason, we talk to people\nwe meet for a reason. We pursue goals as soon as we are born. We try\nhard to learn to walk, talk, get along with our family, get our needs\nsatisfied, and find out what we like and what we don’t like. We do\nthis from birth. If school related to the goals that children actually\nhad, that they were working on at the very moment that they entered\nschool, school would seem like a natural and helpful experience. Students\nwouldn’t stress about satisfying their teachers any more than\nthey stressed about satisfying their parents when they were learning\nto walk and talk. Yes, they want to please their parents, but that is not\nexactly the same thing.\nPeople know what their goals are and they know when something\nthey are being offered, a parasailing lesson or a pomegranate, for example,\ndoesn’t fit with their goals. They can be convinced to try out\na new activity that they believe will not satisfy any of their goals, but\nfor the most part it is difficult to convince them that weird things that\nwere not on their goal list actually should be on the list. We say things\nto students like, “You will need this later.” But this is usually a boldfaced\nlie. You don’t need algebra later. Making up nonsense convinces\nnobody.\nThere is a more important issue here. Later on in this book I will\ndetail the 12 kinds of learning that make up what it means to learn. If\nCognitive Process-Based Education 9\nyou get good at learning these things, you get good at what life has to\noffer. The list above is a partial list of the group of learning processes\nthat I detail in Chapter 4. It is really quite important. I have used dating\nas a simple way of explaining it because no one has to explain why\nthat matters to a teenager. Teenagers know that they have to learn the\nprocesses that I discuss in Chapter 4. As things are now, these important\nissues are not considered significant enough to deal with seriously\nin school. World history is always considered more important. But\nwhy should that be the choice?\nEarlier, I mentioned that students want to learn how to drive as\nwell as how to date. This is a pretty universal goal that teenagers have\nso we should ask of it as well whether it is important and what it\nmight be an instance of that is inherently significant in real life.\nOn the surface, driving seems a skill that is an important part of\ndaily life. So, one is led to ask why driving isn’t a school subject? The\nanswer is that it is. Driver’s education has been taught in schools for\nmany years. Not every school offers it, but many do. So what is the\nproblem? It is just a useful skill, not a scholarly subject, so surely I\nam not suggesting that it is more important than physics. That is, of\ncourse, exactly what I am suggesting.\nIn our test-driven society, when driver’s ed is taught, it is taught\nwith a clear goal and a clear notion of success. When a student has\npassed the tests and gotten her driver’s license, everyone is satisfied.\nWell, not everyone. I was once called in on a consulting assignment\nfor a university hospital that was working on a study to prevent\nteenage car accidents. The study was funded by an insurance company\nthat would have been happy to pay out less in damages and, presumably,\nalso thought fewer dead kids would be a generally good thing.\nWhat is the problem?\nStudents may have their licenses but they don’t know much about\ndriving and responsibility. It wouldn’t be a shock to anyone to know\nthat kids drink and drive, text message and drive, and generally yell\nand scream and goof around while driving. They often die from this\nbehavior. Could we teach them not to do that? The answer always\nseems to be to put up posters that say don’t drink and drive and to\nmake them watch scary movies about car accidents. The school system\nstrikes again.\nIf we tell them, then they will do it, never seems to work, but we keep\ntrying.\n10 Teaching Minds\nI often have used the Department of Motor Vehicles (the DMV) as\nan example of the best there is in testing. They have two tests. Dumb\nmultiple choice questions that make no sense and a real test that tests\nto see whether you can drive. Schools typically don’t have the real test\nat all, one that tests to see whether you actually can do something, so\nthe DMV at least is smarter than the school system.\nBut the real issue is something else entirely. Driving is an instance\nof a piece of very complex behavior that exemplifies one of the ways\nin which we learn. Perhaps more important, driving entails a great\ndeal of other things, which could be learned and should be learned.\nA simple example of this is car mechanics. Once upon a time\nschools taught kids to fix cars as well as to drive them. Perhaps they\nstill do. But vocational subjects like that have been relegated to the\nback burner of education so that more testable subjects can be taught.\nAlso, cars have gotten more difficult to fix. This is too bad, because\nif car mechanics were required instead of physics, students actually\nmight learn science.\nWhat do I mean by this?\nWhen we hear an outcry about the nation’s need to make children\nlearn science, no one ever asks why. The standard answer, if this is\never asked, is that science is important in tomorrow’s world or some\nsuch nonsense. Push harder and you might get some remarks along\nthe lines that soon all the scientists will be Indian and Chinese, which\nmay be the real fear of those who push science in the United States. To\naddress this question properly, one has to ask what exactly is meant\nby “science.”\nImagine that you are a student working on fixing a car in a car\nmechanics class. As I write this I am imagining a scene from the musical\nGrease, which was set in the 1950s when there actually were cars\nto work on in school. I never got to work on a car because I went to a\nscience high school where such a thing would be looked down upon.\nSo when I graduated from high school and drove to college and my car\nbroke down, I hadn’t the slightest idea what to do. I wish I could tell\nyou that at least I understood the physics of the engine but I didn’t. I\njust knew F = MA and other stuff that wasn’t going to help me fix my\nengine.\nNow let me ask you, how is fixing one’s car engine like fixing\none’s air conditioning or plumbing? The answer to this question has\nCognitive Process-Based Education 11\nembodied within it what it means to do science. When science means\nlearning facts about science, we are talking about useless information\nthat is readily forgotten after the test. I have no idea why anyone\nlearns to balance chemical equations or apply physics formulas or\nlearns about biology classifications in high school. None of this is of\nany use to most adults. (It is easy to test, however.)\nWhen the stuff that is being taught does not relate to the inherent\ngoals of the students, it will be forgotten. You can count on it.\nWhy this stuff is taught is simply that it derives from a conception of\nscience prevalent in the 1890s that has not been modified since. It is\ndefended by people as a way to produce more scientists, which makes\nno sense since it probably deters more students from entering science\nthan it encourages.\nScientific reasoning, on the other hand, is worth teaching.\nWhy?\nBecause car mechanics, plumbers, doctors, and crime investigators,\nto name four random professions, all do scientific reasoning on a daily\nbasis. As a society we anoint only doctors with the glory of doing\nactual scientific reasoning. The other professions get less glamorous\ninterpretations. But they are all doing the same stuff. This is what they\nare doing:\nThey are taking a look at evidence and trying to determine the\nprobable causes of the conditions that they have found.\nTo do this one must know what causes what in the real world, which\nis science; what counts as evidence of known conditions, which is science;\nand previous cases that are similar and that any good scientist\nmust know. So while we may not think of a plumber as doing scientific\nreasoning, that is exactly what he is doing.\nScience is about creating hypotheses and gathering evidence to\nsupport or refute those hypotheses. Children are natural scientists.\nThey often try stuff out—skipping rocks on the water or dropping\nstones from the roof or lighting things on fire—to see what happens.\nBut there is more to science than trying stuff out. One must seek explanations\nand make sure those explanations are correct. Knowing what\nconstitutes a correct explanation is really the essence of what scientific\nknowledge is about. But notice that there are correct explanations for\n12 Teaching Minds\nhypotheses in plumbing as well as in medicine and that these explanations\nexist for repairing a faulty engine and for understanding who\ncommitted a crime. It is all scientific reasoning.\nThe difference between plumbing and medicine is in the complexity\nof the science. Not a lot of invention goes on in plumbing and\nthere aren’t all that many explanations to choose from. The degree of\ndifficulty in understanding what is going on and why is what separates\nthose fields and makes one science and one not. But the basic\nthought processes are the same.\nThis is important to notice because all these areas of inquiry are\nwhat we might call diagnostic.\nSo, and this is the important part, the real issue from a cognitive\nscience point of view is not in teaching science per se, but in teaching\nscientific activities, one of which is diagnosis. And, since diagnosis is a\nsimilar process no matter what you are diagnosing, it makes sense that\nall through school, diagnosis would be a subject, and not physics or\nliterature. The things that children are asked to diagnose might start\nwith things little kids like, like finding out what is wrong with their\npets or their toys, and then move on to things bigger kids like, like cars\nand crime, and then move on to large issues, like why a business has\nfailed or why our foreign policy doesn’t work.\nDiagnosis matters a great deal in our lives, yet it is not a subject in\nschool. This is not surprising because the origins of the school subject\nareas, as I have said, are scholarly. But if we want to teach children to\ndo things that matter and we want to retain their interest because they\nknow intrinsically that these things do matter, then we must have\nthem practice diagnosis all through their school lives, in a variety of\nvenues that correlate with their interests. They don’t all have to diagnose\nthe same stuff. It is the diagnostic process itself that matters, not\nwhat is diagnosed.\nI have been using the word subject for an idea like diagnosis but it\nis not a subject and should not be seen that way. I have been using the\nword only to contrast it to existing subjects in school. Diagnosis is a\nfundamental cognitive activity. Cavemen did diagnosis. They may not\nhave done it well, but they did it well enough to continue the species.\nThe diagnostic process is as old as people. Knowing why, being able to\nprove a hypothesis, is a fundamental cognitive process.\nSchool needs to be organized around fundamental cognitive activities.\nIt would be easy to demean what I have said here by saying\nCognitive Process-Based Education 13\nI want to teach kids to date and drive better. What kind of school is\nthat?\nBut this trivializes the point. I do want to teach students to date\nand drive better. But these are just a few instantiations of general cognitive\nprocesses. Forming human relationships and figuring out what\nis going in the physical world are two of many very important cognitive\nabilities that manifest themselves in myriad ways in real life.\nA properly designed school system needs to focus on cognitive\nabilities, not scholarly subjects. Kids will recognize instantly that these\nactivities are the ones they know how to do and that they need to get\nbetter at. If we allow them to choose what areas of knowledge they\nwould like to focus on while learning these skills, they would be attentive\nand interested students. No more ADHD. Poof!\nA society that organized schools around cognitive abilities would\nbecome one where people were used to thinking about what they did\nand how and why they did it. They would not find school stressful or\nboring.\nThis wouldn’t be a bad thing.\n\nCHAPTER 2\nTeaching Kids to Walk and Talk\nFailure is instructive. The person who really thinks learns quite\nas much from his failures as from his successes.\n—John Dewey\nTeaching is a serious issue. Teachers matter. Or at least they should matter.\nBut we have the sense that it is the job of the teacher to tell us stuff.\nStudents expect it and teachers do it. Often, teachers get criticized if\nthey do anything else. And, this is pretty much the beginning and the\nend of the problem with teaching. We force teachers to teach wrong.\nI am beyond the age where I have little kids that I have to teach\nhow to walk and talk. But when I did, I don’t remember preparing\nany lesson plans. In a cognitive process-based model of education, all\nteaching looks like the teaching you do when you teach your children\nto walk and talk.\nLately I have been personally interested in being taught. This is\nbecause at the age of 55 I started to play softball in an old guys’ softball\nleague in Florida. I discovered I wasn’t really very good. This was a bit\nsurprising since I had played in the university softball leagues while I\nwas a professor and had stopped playing only in my 40s. I wasn’t a bad\nplayer then. There hadn’t been that long a hiatus. And, I was playing\nagainst people a good deal older than myself since I am rather young\nas recent Florida transplants go. I used to be a good hitter and I wasn’t\nnow. The reason was easy enough to understand. In the university\nleagues they play fast pitch. A batter has a second or so to decide about\nswinging. It is all instinct. At least it was after having played for 40\nsome odd years.\nBut, in Florida, old guys play slow pitch. The pitcher throws the\nball in a high looping arc and it is a strike if it lands on the plate. Quite\na different experience from trying to hit a ball that is zinging by your\nhead. Should be easier, no? Not for me. It took a bit of thinking to\nfigure out why.\n15\n16 Teaching Minds\nI analyzed how I was swinging, when I was swinging, and what\nkinds of pitches I was swinging at, and I came to many different conclusions.\nI realized I needed to wait longer before I swung. I realized I\nhad to stop swinging at inside pitches (the ones that almost hit you).\nI realized that I had to stop swinging at pitches that looked good but\nyet dropped in front of my feet. I realized I had to see the ball hit the\n“sweet spot” on the bat. I realized I needed to change my whole approach\nto hitting, in fact.\nOK. I realized a lot. I had come to many conclusions. Now what?\nJust do it, right? Aha. Not so simple.\nYou can’t just do what you know you should do. Why not? Because\nyour subconscious isn’t listening to what you have to say. This is\nwhy you don’t tell a little kid how to walk and talk. Apart from the fact\nthat he wouldn’t understand you anyway, even if he could understand\nyou, the part of his mind that would be doing the understanding is\nthe conscious part. Cognitive process-based teaching teaches nonconscious\nprocesses a good deal of the time.\nA child learns a lot more from falling down than he ever will learn\nfrom hearing Mom say, “Watch your step.”\nWe are wired to learn from failure. Those who don’t learn from\nfailure typically die young. We are descended from people who learned\nnot to eat certain poisonous plants, and not to travel in a way that\nwould expose them to danger, and to stay near their mates, and to\nprotect their offspring. Those who didn’t do these things, those who\ndidn’t learn from their own failures and from the failures of others,\ndidn’t get to have surviving offspring. The human race exists precisely\nbecause it is capable of learning from failure, both individually and\ncollectively.\nDid you ever wonder why what you learned in school isn’t still in\nyour head, or why you can’t remember what your wife wanted you to\nget from the store on your way home? Or, why the things you have\ndecided to do to improve your business or make more money or be a\nbetter person actually don’t ever get executed? The answer is simple:\nYou can’t learn by listening—not from teachers, not from your wife,\nnot from helpful suggestions from wise people, and not even from\nyourself.\nWhy not? Because it is your subconscious that is in charge of executing\ndaily activities—from swinging a bat, to driving home, to talking\nto people you want to make an impression on, to getting along\nwith your wife. Your conscious mind can make decisions, but your\nTeaching Kids to Walk and Talk 17\nsubconscious pretty well does what it is in the habit of doing. The\nsubconscious is a habit-driven processor.\nBad habits, as they say, are hard to break. Actually, all habits, good\nor bad, are hard to break. A new swing is really hard to develop, as is a\nnew way of selling, or a new way of treating people, or driving a new\nroute home.\nThis is the real use of education: the creation of new habits. This\ncan be done in only one way. The subconscious learns in only one\nway.\nThe subconscious learns by repeated practice.\nThe only teaching that can work, then, is the kind of mentoring that\nhelps someone execute better while they are practicing.\nHow is a high school football coach different from a high school\nhistory teacher?\nBefore we attempt to answer this question, we need to consider\nwhy it is an important question to consider. In general, I think most\npeople would agree that the behavior of these two types of teachers is\nlikely to be quite different. In our mind’s eye, we see images of yelling\nand crude behavior versus refined lecture and discussion. But let’s get\nbeyond the superficial stereotypes and think about what they teach\nrather than their style of teaching it.\nThe history teacher at his worst teaches facts, and at his best teaches\ncareful analysis of sources of facts.\nThe football coach at his worst teaches that someone could never\npossibly do something, and at his best coaches someone to do something\nbetter.\nThe history teacher teaches the conscious. The football coach\nteaches the subconscious.\nThis makes sense if we view education (in school) as a conscious\naffair. It certainly seems to be a conscious affair. We discuss history,\nwe don’t do history. And, it makes sense in football since the coach\ndoesn’t need players who can discuss football—he needs players who\ncan execute.\nIt begins to make less sense when we consider how the conscious\nand the subconscious interact.\nAs long as we see ourselves as rational beings who can think logically\nand make carefully reasoned decisions about our daily lives,\nthen education indeed should be about the promotion of reasoned\n18 Teaching Minds\ndeliberation and the gaining of knowledge that will enhance our ability\nto reason. But suppose this conception we have of ourselves and\nour ability to reason logically is simply wrong?\nOur entire education system depends on this debate. Actually the\nword debate is really not right here as there is no debate. The other\nside, the side that says we need to teach our unconscious because our\nconscious isn’t capable of listening, has not really been expressed directly\nvery often. It is, however, indirectly referred to often enough.\nPlato comments:\nThe most important part of education is right training in the\nnursery. The soul of the child in his play should be guided to\nthe love of that sort of excellence in which when he grows up to\nmanhood he will have to be perfected.\nWhy should this be the case? Why should it be in the nursery where\nreal training takes place? And, what kind of training could the nursery\nprovide—the kind of the football coach or the kind of the history\nteacher? And, what can we learn about education by considering seriously\nwhat Plato said?\nThe principles of learning in childhood are rather simple really.\nThe first and most important part of an analysis of early childhood\nlearning is an understanding of where the motivation comes from.\nIf learning starts with a goal, as we have said, one question is, What\ngoals do children have and how do they happen to have them?\nWhen people mention motivation, the word reward often is added\ninto the discussion. What kinds of rewards do children receive and to\nwhat extent are these involved in learning? Bear in mind that there\nare three kinds of rewards: intrinsic, extrinsic, and systemic. If it makes\nme happy, I don’t need you to tell me I did well. If the activity doesn’t\nreally matter to me (an algebra test, for example), I will need some\noutside reward to even try. When do kids learn because of the use of\nexternal rewards? If I do well on an algebra test, it might be that it\ngives me intrinsic happiness to know I did well at algebra. As a mathoriented\nkid, I did get that kind of reward. It also makes you happy\nwhen your parents are proud of you. And it makes you happy when\nyour grades win you admission into Yale or get you something else\nyou might want. Which types of rewards figure into early childhood\nlearning and what can we learn from this about learning? And, what\nwill this tell us about teaching?\nTeaching Kids to Walk and Talk 19\nLet’s start with walking and talking.\nWalking and talking are intrinsically rewarding. No kid needs encouragement\nto do either. They do have to be discouraged from crying\nwhen a word will serve them better. I want milk works better than wah.\nBut they learn this quite naturally without very much parental help.\nThey learn to walk when their parents hold their hands and cheer\nwhen they succeed, but they would have learned to walk anyway.\nThe parents’ role as the teachers of their children can be seen very\nclearly when we consider walking and talking. Kids can learn to do\neither without much help, but they do these things quicker and better\nwith parental help. Children who are spoken to by their parents, and\nlistened to and corrected when they make an error, learn to speak well\nand more clearly as adults. While everyone learns to walk, parental\ncare prevents falls when steps and other hazards present themselves.\nSo, is the parent teaching the child? What does the parent actually\nknow about how to teach walking and talking? Actually the parent\nknows quite a bit about teaching. We are wired to teach our children\nand help them. All higher level animals do this as well. It is not a particularly\nconscious process.\nSo, at what point are children better taught by professional teachers\ninstead of their parents? This is an important and interesting question.\nA professional teacher is better than a parent if and only if the\nteacher knows more about what is being taught than the parent does.\nTeachers may take education courses and that may seem to qualify\nthem to teach, but really those courses are not so much about the art\nof teaching per se. Teachers learn to teach by teaching, like anyone\nelse learns how to do anything. But teachers learn to teach in the\nsystem they find themselves in. This means that typically they learn\nhow to manage classrooms and deal with administrators and handle\nvarious issues that are very specific to school.\nTeaching outside of school usually does not entail managing multiple\nchildren nor should it entail dealing with state standards and other\ngovernmental interference (although that often happens anyway).\nSo, knowledge is the real issue in teaching, not teaching skill. Or\nso it would seem.\nActually this idea is clearly wrong if one thinks about university\nteaching. Professors become professors by writing a Ph.D. thesis, not\nby learning anything about teaching. They may have some teaching\nexperience prior to becoming professors because they may have\ntaught an introductory course or two as graduate students, but nobody\n20 Teaching Minds\nteaches them how to teach. In fact, professors are not qualified to\nteach since they know nothing about teaching. They are hired by universities\nbecause of their research credentials, and teaching doesn’t\nmatter much. There is some lip service about the subject but no one\never got hired at Yale as a professor because she was a great teacher\nwho did no research.\nHere is a professor of computer science from a very highly ranked\nBig Ten university (he does not want his name mentioned):\nEvery faculty member in the Department of Computer Science\nat my university thinks that their small insignificant area is\nimportant enough that all undergraduates must take a course in\nit. When you add all those courses up there is simply no time\nfor a student to do anything other than take crazy courses in\nsubdisciplines represented by the faculty in the department.\nEverybody’s course is a sacred cow. If you tried to put something\nnew in, something would have to come out, and no faculty\nmember wants his course to be eliminated.\nProfessors are not there because they are good teachers.\nI certainly knew nothing about teaching when I became a professor\nat Stanford many years ago. But I hated seeing students bored and\nmiserable and started to think about what the problem was and how\nI could fix it. Many professors do exactly this. They want to be good\nat something they do regularly and their pride makes them into good\nteachers. Not all professors do this, by any means. What does it mean\nto become a good teacher in that context?\nProfessors are rated for their teaching ability. It is clear if one looks\nat those ratings what the criteria are from the students’ perspective.\nThey rate the friendliness, fairness, enthusiasm, and even the “hotness”\nof their teachers. These ratings have been studied extensively and\nconclusions like this one are typical:\nWhile student evaluations of faculty performance are a valid\nmeasure of student satisfaction with instruction, they are not by\nthemselves a valid measure of teaching effectiveness. If student\nevaluations of faculty are included in the evaluation process of\nfaculty members, then they should represent only one of many\nmeasures that are used. 1\nTeaching Kids to Walk and Talk 21\nProfessors and universities are very concerned about the evaluations\nof the teaching of the faculty and these days websites (like www.ratemyprofessors.com)\nmake a very public show of how badly received\nsome professors are. The professors are concerned with how they appear\nand whether they are liked and how all this might affect their\nsalaries. They are not concerned with teaching effectiveness because\nthey are not really teachers in their own minds.\nLet’s hear from an Ivy League professor (who also doesn’t want to\nbe named):\nThere are faculty here who study real-world phenomena and\ndon’t know how to apply that knowledge to their own lives. We\ncould teach students here how to make use of what we teach\nin their own lives, we just don’t. Right now the approach that\nis taken makes most of the information that professors impart\nuseless. It doesn’t have to be that way.\nMy colleagues here don’t even do what they are studying\nwhen they are out of the lab. They are not successful people in\nlife. If someone studying memory had to remember something,\nwould they make use of their own data? I doubt it. Many of our\nprofessors don’t realize that they may not know as much as they\nthink they know. All these people assume that whatever they do\nis the best that can be done.\nWhen a child learns to walk, you cannot say you were very good at\nteaching her to walk. She would have learned to walk without your\nhelp, most likely. When you teach a child to play baseball, you can\nmore easily say that you were a good teacher, but really who knows\nyou didn’t screw him up with nonsense that it may take him years to\nundo? I was taught to step into the pitch in baseball and years later\nlearned that what I was taught was wrong.\nCollege professors can be evaluated on effectiveness only if someone\nknows what that means. Does it mean how well students do on\nexams? We can make easier exams then. Does it mean how many of\nthem get into Ph.D. programs at Harvard or how many get good jobs\nupon graduation? That likely has nothing to do with the effectiveness\nof the professors.\nThere are no measures that make sense, for a very simple reason.\nCollege teaching doesn’t make much sense in the first place. Lecturing\n22 Teaching Minds\nand giving grades is certainly not a paradigm that any parent would\nuse. You don’t grade your child on speaking ability; you help her speak\nbetter. If it takes longer to do that, then it does. Even the DMV doesn’t\ncare about effective teaching. It doesn’t give grades, just licenses. Can\nyou do it well? is the question the DMV is charged with answering. But\ncan you do it well? isn’t a meaningful question in the top universities\nbecause there is typically nothing, other than research, that anyone is\nreally being taught to do.\nThis leaves us in a quandary when it comes to understanding what\nit means to teach well. Here is the Ivy League professor again:\nPeople need to learn to generalize the information that they are\ngiven. They need to learn how to think about content in order\nto see how that content may or may not be true for them. We do\nnot do that here. Instead we teach that this is the way it is done.\nWe have kids at mediocre universities who don’t know the\nfacts and then we have kids at the good schools who know the\nfacts but very few who know that those facts are not necessarily\ntrue. We need a different approach to knowledge than we\ncurrently have. By having students memorize the facts, it makes\nit seem as if the facts are truer than they actually are. We need to\nteach students to attack the facts and not to replace them with\nother facts.\nIf facts are taught here in this way, and we are setting the\nstandard, then we have a problem. Some faculty here actually do\nteach in this way, but it is not the main culture. Even the hardcore\nfacts, like dates, are arguable. Students are not taught to use\nthe information they have to question other information.\nIf we are teaching something where there are no performance measures,\nthen effectiveness cannot be gauged. If the performance measurement\nis based on an exam, this likely would not reflect on the\nteacher’s ability at all. Some students do well on exams and others\ndon’t, even though they all hear exactly the same lectures. And, when\nthere are performance measures, it is not always clear that it was the\nteacher who was in any way responsible for the success of the students\n(or their failure).\nSo what is effective teaching?\nTeaching Kids to Walk and Talk 23\nIf a teacher is better at teaching a child than a parent is, it must\nbe because the teacher knows something the parent doesn’t know or,\nat least, doesn’t know how to teach. This makes the teacher more effective\nthan the parent, but for very uninteresting reasons. You can’t\nteach what you don’t know, of course.\nBut knowledge alone is meaningless because teaching is not about\nthe transfer of knowledge. I realize that a great many people think that\nthis is what teaching is about; except if that were the issue, students\nwouldn’t even think about rating their teachers on anything except\nhow much they knew. And, by the way, that is about the last thing\nteachers are ever rated on.\nFor the most part, teachers are rated by students on how entertaining\nthey are. But entertainment and teaching are really not particularly\nrelated. They are not unrelated because you can’t get through to\nsomeone who has tuned you out. But you can entertain your students\nand get great ratings and still teach them nothing.\nHere is the Big Ten professor again:\nAt a big state university, which one would think has an\nobligation to supply training to the students of that state in a\nmajor field in which students can readily find employment,\nthe faculty could care less about that and they only want to\ndo graduate teaching. We teach courses that are modeled after\ncourses in the professor training schools like Harvard and MIT.\nBut how many professors do we need?\nSuperstars who bring a lot of funding are very important in\nthe university. The superstar system made sense when there were\nsuperstars. But today how many of these superstars have really\nbig ideas? Does my school really have any superstars at all? I\ndon’t think so.\nThe School of Education, where I am also on the faculty,\nhas a research focus, which they do badly. Most of their\nstudents plan to be teachers. But they teach them the literature\nand not how to teach. It is the same situation as in computer\nscience. They really want their students to become professors of\neducation. They are not teaching teachers to teach because they\ndon’t care about that. They look down their noses at teacher\npreparation schools. Ninety-eight percent of their undergraduates\n24 Teaching Minds\nwant to become teachers but the faculty are focusing on their\ngraduate students. They don’t teach the teachers. They do it, but\nit is not their focus.\nThe average professor of education here understands that he\nis supposed to teach teachers to teach but he gets evaluated on\nhis research not on the quality of teachers who come out. It is\na research university. How many dollars do you bring in? How\nmuch do you publish? Where would quality of teacher training\nfit in that model?\nSo, again, what exactly is effective teaching? Let’s look at two of the longer\nversions of what my former Ph.D. students and former employees\nwrote to me when I asked about good teaching. These stories each need\nsome context in order to be understood, and then I will comment.\nThe first story is from a Ph.D. student of mine who then continued\nto work with me for 30 more years.\nYou were collecting key things teachers needed to know to do\nstory curricula properly. Your contribution was “know when to\nlie to students.” That triggered all kinds of discussion, pro and\ncon, leading eventually to a longer, more explicit statement\nabout knowing when to oversimplify, etc.\nReflecting on it later, I realized that “know when to lie to\nstudents” was the right way to say it. The rephrased version was\ntoo reasonable. It didn’t trigger any emotional reaction and reevaluation.\n“Know when to lie” is a lie, but that’s the point.\nWhy is this story important? I placed it here because it reflects an\nimportant belief that I hold about teaching. At the moment to which\nhe is referring, we were writing, as a group, a set of guidelines on how\nto teach Socratically using the online curricula we were building for\nhigh schools. We were, in essence, writing an instruction manual for\nteachers on how to teach in a new way. When I supervise very smart\npeople who know perfectly well how to do things, I deliberately provoke\nthem. I believe that my job is to make them think. There is no\nbetter way to make people think than by annoying them in a way that\nmakes them defend their point of view, especially when their point of\nview may not have been well thought out.\nTeaching Kids to Walk and Talk 25\nIt is important, when teaching Socratically, which is my preferred\nmethodology, to make students question their beliefs. No one is a better\nteacher than a teacher who makes students wonder whether he has\nbeen wrong about something.\nDo I think that teachers should lie to students?\nI think teachers should make students think harder than they\nmight have been capable of doing without the teachers. I also think\nthat teachers should not tell answers to students. Students do not learn\nfrom memorizing answers. They learn from developing questions for\nthemselves that they then can begin to find answers to.\nI believe that effective teaching makes . . .\nstudents develop questions to which they then will seek answers\nstudents look for answers from people other than the teacher\nstudents confused and less certain than they were before\nNow, I realize that these are pretty nonstandard ideas. That is, of\ncourse, the point.\nThis next writer worked for me (after getting his Ph.D. elsewhere)\nin the academic world and later in the business world.\nProbably the most important lesson I learned from you was the\nvalue of overstatement and oversimplification in communicating\nideas and getting people’s attention. I recently retired and was\nroasted at my retirement party by a group of longtime employees\nand there were some interesting anecdotes about what I’d taught\nthem about selling their ideas through management. Software\nengineers are often uncomfortable making a point without\ngiving every possible nuance, caveat, and detail. This typically\ncauses management’s eyes to gloss over and their ideas never\nget a fair hearing. So, I’ve (apparently relentlessly) encouraged\nemployees to make their points quickly and to use overstatement\nand oversimplification as rhetorical devices. I’m still wincing\nover the roasts that portrayed my predilection for interrupting\npresenters and asking, “What’s your point?”—I learned that one\nfrom you.\n26 Teaching Minds\nI most certainly taught the lessons this writer describes. I hated it\nwhen students couldn’t get to the point and I frequently interrupted\nthem when they were speaking. In business, I make a point of saying\nthings that are very simple, which tends to upset people. I find this a\ngood way to start a conversation that addresses complex issues.\nOf course, I never actually say any of this. I simply do it. The real\nissue in teaching, by parents or by teachers or by anyone else, is the\nmodel you present to the students. That model is presented by what\nthey see you do and how they see you act. They can choose to emulate\nyou or not. But a good teacher makes students think about how to\nbehave and about what works and what doesn’t.\nI believe that effective teaching makes . . .\nstudents think about how the teacher is behaving and causes\nthe students to wonder about whether copying this behavior\nwould be a good idea\nstudents think about what works and what doesn’t in the adult\nworld\nThis next writer is a professor at a major university. I hired him to be\non the faculty at Yale, which was his first academic job.\nI teach by telling stories that are meaningful to me. I let them\nsee who I am and how I live. I let them see what is important\nto me and why. To be a real teacher you have to let yourself be\nvulnerable. The student needs to see that you are a human with\nfeelings and fears and goals. You are saying to students: This is\nthe way I do it; it fits with who I am; it helps me be successful;\nand don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something.\nEveryone wants to control you, but in the end, you have to be\nyou, for better or worse. So, don’t let anyone tell you that you\ncan’t do something.\nI tell that story over and over and over again in different\nways. About my research, about my company, about my family. I\nwalk the talk.\nAnd, the students have to see that there are consequences\nof breaking the rules; that it costs; and the costs can be high\nTeaching Kids to Walk and Talk 27\nat times. But that’s part of the price of believing in yourself.\nSometimes you get hurt and then you have to pick yourself up\nand try it again.\nThis writer was writing about his teaching. I behave this way as well,\nand he knows it.\nI believe that effective teaching makes . . .\nstudents think about the stories the teacher tells\nstudents believe that their teacher is not a phony, so they can\ntake what is said seriously\nstudents think about what it means to put oneself on the line for\none’s own beliefs\nThe next writer worked for me as a writer for many years. Her main\ncareer was, and is, as a concert musician.\nMy high school English teacher was a great teacher. He was\nmarried to the Singer sewing machine heiress but committed\nto teaching kids. He had us keep a writing journal and was just\nexcellent at helping me understand what was so personal to me\nthat others wouldn’t be able to connect (or perhaps just plain\nsappy romantic drivel!) and what was “strong” and pertinent to\neveryone. I still have the journal and wince at what I wrote but\nstill really admire his comments in the margins.\nIn the future, in a world where online learning begins to preempt\nclassroom teaching, mentoring will replace lecturing. Many teachers\nknow how to mentor but often they are not given the opportunity\nor don’t take the time to do it. The teacher described above was a\npersonal writing mentor, which is about the only way you can teach\nsomeone to write.\nI believe that effective teaching makes . . .\nstudents look more carefully at the work that they themselves\nhave produced\nstudents believe that their teacher is their personal mentor\n28 Teaching Minds\nHere is the same woman, this time writing about how she learned\nmusic.\nMy mentor, Otto-Werner Mueller, was conducting the Yale\nPhilharmonia in the 1970s—I met him as an undergrad in\nMadison, WI. I attended his graduate seminars in Madison and\nspent a lot of time with him while he was in New Haven. He\nguest-conducted the Hartford Symphony (where I now work)\ntwice in the past few years. (He is 83 now.) I spent hours and\nhours in “lab orchestra” watching him teach his conducting\nstudents, both in Madison and at Yale. What always struck\nme was how students were either so self-conscious they were\nwooden, or how they’d try to imitate Otto (who at 6 feet, 7\ninches had amazing stature) physically and couldn’t pull it off.\nVery few were able to incorporate what he was teaching and then\nmake it their own.\nI believe that effective teaching makes . . .\nstudents look at what the teacher does and see how they can\nimitate it in a way that is consonant with who they are\nThe next writer was a Ph.D. student of mine and is now a professor at\na major university.\nTrust your intuitions. This was something you told many of\nus over and over. It has had three meanings for me—first, that\nthe only right things to work on are those that I can imagine a\nsolution to; second, that whether a way of attacking something\nis the right way or not, it will lead me to the right way; and\nthird, go out on a limb. I can’t say how I learned this except,\nperhaps, through trusting your advice and then noticing that it\ngot me to success over and over again. It began to really sink in\nwhen I had my own students. Often, the most interesting things\nthey brought to me were more intuitive than they were based\non what everyone else was saying. And I have had to reassure\npeople that their ideas are good and they should follow up on\nthem. Of course, there are also intuitions that my students have\nthat I don’t think are good, and I don’t advise them to follow\nTeaching Kids to Walk and Talk 29\nup on those. So I think I now believe in trusting intuitions that\nsomeone I trust can also see value in, and for my students, trust\nintuitions that someone they trust can also see value in.\nI believe that effective teaching makes . . .\nstudents trust their own intuitions\nstudents trust their teacher’s advice\nThe final two are a little different from the others. I included them\nbecause teaching is not always implicit, as the above stories indicate,\nbut sometimes explicit. The next writer was student of mine who is\nnow high up in a large corporation.\nYou taught me that you always start by collecting data—so basic,\nbut so often overlooked. I recall watching most of your papers\nstart by collection of data. I recall watching your criticisms of\nwork that was just abstraction on abstraction, with no data at\nits roots. For the work I’m currently doing, I have a log of all the\ntypes of entities (typically business or government enterprises),\ninteractions (typically business models or sustainability models),\nand outcomes. I just gave five talks last week and used the\nmethod of “start by collecting data” when introducing my work\nand when being a critical thinker about the work of others that\nwas being presented to me.\nThis point is about how to do real research does not apply to everyone.\nBut a more general form of this advice is to start at the beginning,\nwhich is usually useful advice. Knowing where the beginning is can\nbe complicated, however.\nI believe that effective teaching makes . . .\nstudents understand how to begin a process\nstudents understand what you tell if you constantly demonstrate\nthe value of what you tell them\nThis writer was another of my Ph.D. students who is now a professor\nat a major university.\n30 Teaching Minds\nYou taught me about the important role of explicit social\nhierarchies in a learning environment. At Yale the hierarchy was\nvery clear and everyone knew exactly where they stood. You\npay your dues before you join the club and academia is chock\nfull of clubs. You taught this by both example and explanation.\nSeeing a good clear example of a social hierarchy that works\n(such as the one we had in our lab at Yale) gave me one level\nof understanding, but I had to see what happens when the\nhierarchy is not so obvious to truly appreciate the importance\nof the whole concept. Any longstanding community will have a\nsocial hierarchy, but it’s not always so obvious (especially when\nthe community likes to pretend it doesn’t exist), and that makes\nit really hard on newcomers. I’ve seen some really stellar junior\nfaculty get into difficult tenure decisions because no one was\nguiding them politically (or else they just blew it off). And more\nrecently I’ve been running into more and more students with\n“entitlement issues” who just don’t seem to buy into any social\nhierarchies. There is a lot of social commentary on why this is\nhappening and how the workplace needs to adjust to a whole\ngeneration of kids who always got trophies.\nI believe that effective teaching makes . . .\nstudents understand where they fit in the world in which they\nlive\nstudents understand how to get ahead in the world in which\nthey live\nstudents understand the roles of those around them\nThere is certainly a great deal more that one could say about effective\nteaching. Unfortunately, much has been written on effective teaching\nthat is not particularly helpful. Mostly it is politically correct advice\nthat is quite difficult to implement. Here are two lists that I found. The\nfirst is from Learning to Teach in Higher Education. 1\n1: Interest and explanation\n2: Concern and respect for students and student learning\n3: Appropriate assessment and feedback\nTeaching Kids to Walk and Talk 31\n4: Clear goals and intellectual challenge\n5: Independence, control, and active engagement\n6: Learning from students\nThe second is from a Michigan State website and was taken from a\nbook by Arthur W. Chickering and Zelda F. Gamson entitled Seven\nPrinciples for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education. 2\nPrinciple 1: Good practice encourages student–faculty contact\nPrinciple 2: Good practice encourages cooperation among\nstudents\nPrinciple 3: Good practice encourages active learning\nPrinciple 4: Good practice gives prompt feedback\nPrinciple 5: Good practice emphasizes time on task\nPrinciple 6: Good practice communicates high expectations\nPrinciple 7: Good practice respects diverse talents and ways of\nlearning 3\nWhenever I see phrases like diverse talents or ways of learning or active\nlearning or active engagement I am very distrustful of the advice\nbeing offered. Active learning should mean learning by doing, but it\nnever does because learning by doing is very difficult to implement\nin the university context (which is where this advice comes from). It\nis easier to do it in 1st grade, but after a while the class has to sit still\nand listen and that is not active learning no matter what the teaching\nguides say. Different learning styles is usually a way of saying, “some\npeople are dumber than others,” which no one wants to say. What\nbothers me most about these kinds of lists is that they avoid saying\nwhat really needs to be said. It is nearly impossible to measure your\nsuccess as an effective teacher because the performance expectations\nof students are almost always about test scores and very rarely about\nactual production.\nWith this idea in mind, that effective teaching means helping students\ndo what it is they wanted to do and not what it is that you wanted\nthem to do, I will list the suggestions I have been scattering about\nin this chapter. Bear in mind that this is not meant to be a complete\nlist. I got this list the way you saw, by interpreting things written by\nstudents and former employees about their own experiences.\n32 Teaching Minds\nEffective teaching makes . . .\nstudents develop questions to which they then will seek\nanswers\nstudents look for answers from people other than the teacher\nstudents confused and less certain than they were before\nstudents think about how the teacher is behaving and causes\nthe students to wonder about whether copying this behavior\nwould be a good idea\nstudents think about what works and what doesn’t in the adult\nworld\nstudents think about the stories the teacher tells\nstudents believe that their teacher is not a phony, so they can\ntake what is said seriously\nstudents think about what it means to put oneself on the line for\none’s own beliefs\nstudents look more carefully at the work that they themselves\nhave produced\nstudents believe that their teacher is their personal mentor\nstudents look at what the teacher does and see how they can\nimitate it in a way that is consonant with who they are\nstudents trust their own intuitions\nstudents trust their teacher’s advice\nstudents understand how to begin a process\nstudents understand what you tell if you constantly demonstrate\nthe value of what you tell them\nstudents understand where they fit in the world in which they live\nstudents understand how to get ahead in the world in which\nthey live\nstudents understand the roles of those around them\nNow, taking my own advice about starting with the data and then classifying\nit, let’s look at these rules as a group. What exactly are they suggestions\nabout? Broadly speaking, they fall into the following categories:\nHelping students think:\nstudents develop questions to which they then will seek\nanswers\nstudents look for answers from people other than the teacher\nTeaching Kids to Walk and Talk 33\nstudents are confused and less certain than they were before\nstudents think about the stories the teacher tells\nHelping students observe and copy good behavior:\nstudents think about how the teacher is behaving and wonder\nabout whether copying this behavior would be a good idea\nstudents think about what works and what doesn’t in the adult\nworld\nstudents look at what the teacher does and see how they can\nimitate it in a way that is consonant with who they are\nMaking students respect their advisors:\nstudents believe that their teacher is not a phony, so they can\ntake what is said seriously\nstudents believe that their teacher is their personal mentor\nstudents trust their teacher’s advice\nstudents understand what you tell if you constantly demonstrate\nthe value of what you tell them\nTeaching students how and when to take action:\nstudents think about what it means to put oneself on the line for\none’s own beliefs\nstudents understand how to begin a process\nTeaching students to be good critics of their own work:\nstudents look more carefully at the work that they themselves\nhave produced\nstudents trust their own intuitions\nTeaching students their place in the world and how to succeed\nin that world:\nstudents understand where they fit in the world in which they live\nstudents understand how to get ahead in the world in which\nthey live\nstudents understand the roles of those around them\n34 Teaching Minds\nEffective teaching, then, means teaching these things:\nHow to be a critic\nWhom to respect and copy\nHow to know where you fit\nHow to take action\nHow to think\nThe relevant question for a teacher, then, is: Does your teaching result\nin students who can do the five things listed above? There are many\nways to get those things to happen for students. These, however, typically\ndo not include lecturing, being entertaining, giving easy grades\nor easy tests, or marching students through boring exercises that teach\nthem the truth.\nEffective teaching is made much easier, of course, if what you are\ntrying to teach is something worth learning. So, let’s move on to discussing\nthat.\nCHAPTER 3\nWhat Can’t You Teach?\nNothing in education is so astonishing as the amount of ignorance\nit accumulates in the form of inert facts.\n—Henry B. Adams\nWhen children are born, they come with distinct personalities. Ask\nany mother of a second child. “It even behaved differently in the\nwomb,” she will say. One kid is aggressive while the other is contemplative.\nOne kid is constantly talking while the other hardly says a\nword. One kid is shy while the other is outgoing.\nOften, when we think about teaching and learning, we have the\nidea that if we want someone to do something, or know something,\nor behave in a certain way, all we have to do is teach it to them. So we\nteach kids to appreciate music, when they may have no interest in,\nor inclinations toward, music at all, or to act in the class play, when\nthey are simply bad at acting, or to throw a baseball when they simply\ncan’t do it and don’t care. Often, but not always, we are forgiving of\nthe differences between people and their individual talents and we\nacknowledge that she is tone deaf, or he will always throw poorly, and\nwe give up.\nSmall children are like sponges. They ask questions constantly\nand, if they have reasonable parents, get answers. The belief system\nthat children adopt is usually quite similar to that of their parents.\nThey don’t decide to try out a different religion at age 5; they do what\nthey have always known. They eat what they were fed and they like\nto go to places they have been taken. Parents influence every aspect of\na child’s belief system. Because of that, we have the sense that we can\nteach children anything, but this gets less true as they get older. The\nJesuits have a saying about teaching a child before he is 7 and thus\nproducing the man he will become. There is some truth to this. If you\nreally learn honesty when you are 5, it is unlikely you will become a\ncrook. Your subconscious wouldn’t permit it.\n35\n36 Teaching Minds\nThen, what is the role of the subconscious here? When a child is being\ntaught at 3, he is not being taught consciously. He does not memorize\nrules for walking or talking and he does not learn anything very\nmuch by consciously trying to learn. Rather, a child absorbs by constantly\npracticing and then making that practice a part of who she is.\nLater, when the subconscious attitudes about walking, talking,\nrelating to others, family values, and all the rest, are well within the\ndeep subconscious of the child, we begin the attempt to teach the\nchild consciously. We worry when we hear, for example, that:\nAbout a quarter of teens questioned in the broad survey weren’t\nable to correctly identify Adolph Hitler as Germany’s chancellor\nduring World War II. About 20 percent couldn’t say whom\nAmerica fought in that war. 1\nMore than a quarter wrongly believed Columbus sailed to the New\nWorld after 1750. Half didn’t know whom Senator Joseph McCarthy\ninvestigated. And a third had no clue the Bill of Rights is the source\nof freedoms of religion and speech. Nearly a third couldn’t tell you\nwho said in a famous speech: “Ask not what your country can do for\nyou . . . .”\nUntil a child enters school, he has been learning things that are\nuseful to him. He knows where his toys are and how to play with\nthem; he knows how to get food; he knows how to get his parents to\ndo what he wants (perhaps); he knows how to entertain himself. In\nshort, he has learned what he has learned because he has found his\nnew abilities to be of value.\nAnd the history cited above? Of what value is it to know about\nJoe McCarthy? Not only is it of no value to a child, but what we know\nabout McCarthy is slanted by whoever is writing the history and biased\nby whatever point the person is trying to make. It is all very well\nto tell students the truth about what happened in the past and assume\nthat they will learn from it, and therefore not repeat it, but we can’t\neasily know the truth and they are not likely to learn much from the\ntelling anyhow.\nPundits scream and yell about what children don’t know. The\nquestion is: Why do they need to know it? If the answer is that it\nmakes the system happy that they know certain facts while not making\nthe child in any way happier, we all can guess how well that is\ngoing to turn out.\nWhat Can’t You Teach? 37\nThe bottom line here is one of initial belief systems and\nfundamental personality characteristics, coupled with the notion of\ntruly held goals. You cannot teach someone something that:\n• does not help them achieve some goal they actually hold\n• is not in line with their fundamental personality\ncharacteristics\n• goes against their subconscious beliefs\nYou can try, but you won’t succeed.\nSo the question of what you can’t teach, which is very important\nwhen we think about teaching and learning, comes down to a question\nof whom the child has become because of what she learned prior\nto the age of 7, and what she was anyway when she exited the womb.\nThose two things are powerful enough even if you don’t add in trying\nto teach something that in no way relates to any goal the child has.\nThis is even more true for adults, of course. We can try to teach\nadults things that are at odds with who they are as people, but good\nluck with that.\nTraits may come with the child, or they may have been learned\nby the child prior to the age of 7, but it really makes no difference\nwhen we are discussing teaching. Personality cannot be changed.\nCore beliefs are very hard to change. Interests are hard to change,\nalthough new ones can be found. Clinical psychologists try to make\nsmall changes in these aspects of people but they have a very difficult\ntime doing it.\nBut my point here is to address an issue in education and training\nthat is not well understood. Simply stated it is this: It is not possible to\nteach or train students to do things that are not in line with who they are as\npeople. This matters because much of what we try to teach in school\nand train for in companies is an attempt to alter behavior.\nI have been building what have come to be called e-learning systems\nfor about 25 years. Over the years, I have realized that there is\nnothing new under the sun in the subject matter that e-learning systems\nare asked to address. One of my least favorite subjects, one that\ncomes up frequently, is integrity and compliance. I have been asked\nto work on this subject quite often. Usually what is being asked is impossible.\nMost e-learning companies simply do what they are asked to\ndo by the client without pointing out—if they even know—that what\nthey are being asked to teach can’t be taught. Companies that need\n38 Teaching Minds\nto train their employees in such things, because of some regulation or\nother, ask for it, and e-learning companies willingly build it.\nUnfortunately, as my mother would have attested to, were she still\naround, I was born with off-the-scale honesty. I can’t build e-learning\nI know won’t work any more than I was able, when I was 5, to let my\nmother walk out of a store without paying (by mistake) without becoming\nhysterical.\nSo, now I am hysterical about fraudulent education and fraudulent\ne-learning—namely, courses that claim to teach subjects that alter the\nvery nature of a person. Of course, such courses don’t say that is what\nthey are trying to do, but it is pretty much the basis of courses about\nsafe driving or drugs or sexual behavior, or how not to violate the law.\nHow is training about compliance an attempt to alter basic\nbehavior?\nRecently I was presented with an opportunity to teach integrity\nand compliance to the employees of a large company that bids on\nRFPs. The bidding process is part of a legal process and the company\nwants its employees to stay within the guidelines.\nFair enough. Makes sense.\nExcept, when you look at the guidelines, they include an array\nof rules spelled out in a complex document, typically a signed legal\ncontract for potential bidders. To know those rules, one would have\nto read the contract. In effect, the company wants to train people to\nread, and pay careful attention to, the contract. The company wants\nto do this by putting employees in fictitious situations in which someone\nhas not read the contract and this failure to read causes serious\ndifficulties for the company when the employee violates a rule he\ndidn’t know about.\nMuch of e-learning is like this. You are the manager of a large\nproject, which needs to finish on time, and is over budget. Do you:\n• steal money\n• lie about the time you have spent\n• tell the company it can keep the damn project\n• carefully explain to your superiors the problems that exist\nand let them decide\nDo people learn from stuff like this? Of course not. But everyone feels\nbetter after producing it. At least I assume they do.\nWhat Can’t You Teach? 39\nIf this stuff makes people happy, then build more of it, by all\nmeans. But if we want to address real issues, we need to discuss personality\nand how to deal with it.\nI have insisted, as long as I have been discussing education, 2 that\nlearning has to be experientially based. I proposed building complex\nsocial simulators 20 years ago, and this has come to be understood by\nthe e-learning community as telling people they are in a situation that\nthey may or may not relate to instead of actually putting them into a\nvery realistic simulation of that situation. The reason they do it that\nway is money, of course, but something gets lost in the translation.\nWhat is the difference?\nSuppose that I tell you that you are a baseball player in the major\nleagues and your team is down by one run with one out in the bottom\nof the ninth with the bases loaded. I then give you a set of multiple\nchoices about what to do on the first pitch (like, a—take the first pitch,\nb—look for a fast ball, etc.). What is the problem with this? There are\nright answers about what to do, but they depend on many variables\n(Do you know this pitcher’s habits? How have you been hitting today?\nHow fast is the guy on third?). Pretending that we can abstract a situation\nwith a simple description and then suggest there is a right answer,\nis absurd. But more important, if you have never actually been in that\nsituation, if you have never played baseball, your comprehension of\nthe unmentioned details is likely to be zero. Attempting to teach anything\nthrough short descriptions of situations followed by multiple\nchoice answers is just dumb.\nWhy, then, do e-learning companies keep on building courses that\nsound like that? Usually the answer is that corporations that don’t\nknow any better asked them to.\nWhat does this have to do with altering basic behavior? I do indeed\nplay baseball, as I have said, and what I would do in that situation\ndepends on my personality in many ways. It also depends on\nan accurate assessment of my own abilities. What it doesn’t depend\non is deep thought. Professional athletes do not become professional\nathletes owing to their superior cognitive abilities. They have superior\nphysical abilities and rely on instinct for thinking. They do what they\n“know” to do. They don’t think it out. Coaches try like crazy to get\nthem to think it out, but you often can find a 20-year professional veteran\ngetting chewed out by his coach and being asked, What were you\n40 Teaching Minds\nthinking? Nothing. He was thinking nothing. Correct action is rarely\nabout thought, especially when little time for thinking is available.\nSo, then, how do we teach people to do the right thing, especially\nwhen the right thing is not in line with their normal behavior?\nCan we teach nurturance, or aggression, or extroversion, or orderliness?\nI hope that it is obvious that we cannot do this. People are\nborn with these characteristics. They are not learned. Ask any parents\nof more than one child. They will respond that their children had\ncertain personality traits that were apparent from birth. My grandson\nMilo is a neatnik. Everything has to be in its place. Also, he loves to\nperform in front of an audience. His parents do not share and did not\nteach him these behaviors. The degree to which we have such traits\ndefines our innate personalities. So, we need to translate this question\ninto one we can answer.\nThe real issue is one of degree and not of kind. You will never\nteach someone who is fundamentally dishonest to be very honest,\nor vice versa. You will never teach someone who is very aggressive to\nbe very passive. What you can do is make people aware of the consequences\nof their actions and hope to change their behavior slightly,\nwhen they have the time to think about what they are about to do.\nYou can make people aware of their behavior, and their rational selves\ncan direct what they do, if they have time to think about. But their\nsubconscious is likely to want them to behave differently, and it is\ntheir subconscious that is usually in charge in a pinch.\nSomeone who hates details is not a good candidate for being\ntaught to read contracts in detail. Similarly, someone who loves details\nis not a great candidate for sales rep. (Why? Because being very\npeople-oriented is actually a characteristic that never goes hand in\nhand with being detail-oriented.) So, it is not uncommon for companies\nto be faced with the arduous task of training their salespeople\nto pay attention to detail. Telling them to hire differently is hopeless,\nbecause people who are both very detail-oriented and love engaging\npeople socially do not exist. Accountants don’t usually win personality\ncontests. What to do?\nThis is indeed a job for teaching but not for teaching of the usual\nsort. To see what kind of job it is, we need to think for a moment about\nhow the mind works. Specifically, we need to think about how the\nunconscious learns to make decisions.\nWhat Can’t You Teach? 41\nIf you have a character trait, say, honesty, you have had to come\nto grips over the years with its upside and its downside. People appreciate\nyou for being honest, but not when they ask you if they look\ngood after they have spent an hour dressing (I speak from experience\nhere). People dislike dishonesty but not when it helps get a deal closed\nbecause you said you loved a restaurant that you really hated. We have\nmixed feelings about honesty, as we do about any personality characteristic.\nWe like friendly people but we dislike overly friendly people.\nWho decides which is which is anybody’s guess. Teenagers often try\nto be all things to all people, but as adults they soon realize that they\nsimply will have to be themselves and they will try to find work and\nfriends that suit the personalities that they happen to have.\nPersonality features are not conscious. We don’t decide which\nones to have and we may not even be aware of how others perceive\nus. We do what we feel comfortable doing and we push on. And then\nwe meet integrity and compliance officers.\nThey tell us to read every detail of a contract to make sure we are\nin compliance, and those who are detail-oriented and fearful of making\nerrors and introverted and sensitive do it without question, and\nthose people who are gregarious and confident and aggressive figure\nthey can get by without it. What is an integrity and compliance officer\nto do?\nHere is what not to do:\n• Don’t try to tell people who naturally act one way to act\ndifferently.\n• Don’t make a movie of the idiot who did it wrong and\nsay, See, look how dumb that guy was and look what\ntrouble he got into.\n• Don’t lecture on the benefits of behaving the way the\ncompany wants you to behave.\n• Don’t write a manual with correct behavior that no one\nwill read.\n• Don’t build an e-learning course with multiple choice\nanswers where one of them is the right thing to do.\nThe mind is organized around experiences. We remember our experiences\nand we index our remembered experiences so that we can find\nthem later. Individuals don’t know how they do this, but cognitive\n42 Teaching Minds\nscience can tell something about how this process works. You can’t\nfind an experience that was indexed wrong, for example.\nGood indexing involves figuring out the goal that an experience\nrelates to and the conditions that allowed that goal to be achieved\nor not. We do not do this consciously. We learn by doing, that is, we\nlearn from experience, and from thinking about those experiences.\nWhen we have understood our experiences well enough, we can (unconsciously)\nindex them so that they will come up again just in time\nwhen we need them again. (This is what we call being reminded.) It\nis beyond the scope of this book to explain how that process works. 3\nThe simple idea is that experiences get labeled when we think about\nthem and not otherwise.\nSo the real question for an integrity and compliance officer is how\nto get people to think about integrity and compliance issues. This\nthinking needs be done over time in a complex way and voluntarily.\nHow might we do that?\nThat is the real question.\nOne answer to this is stories. People really like stories. As long as\nthere have been people, there have been stories; we have moved from\nepic poems and theatre to novels and movies in recent years, but, by\nand large, the stories are the same. How to overcome obstacles to getting\nwhat you want, is a theme that dominates much of literature,\nfor example. Movie makers say it as “boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy\nloses girl, boy gets girl.” There have been many books written about\nthe basic plots that occur again and again in stories.\nHuman beings understand stories because stories resonate with\nthem. Characters have dilemmas that readers or viewers themselves\nhave had. Stories appeal to emotions rather than logic, and emotions\nare at the heart of our pre-7-year-old unconscious selves. We feel\nsomething because of a well-told story and that feeling can help us see\nsomething in a new way.\nWhy am I going on and on about stories? I believe that all of\nhuman intercourse is about the exchange of stories. (I wrote a book\nabout this. 4 ) If you want to appeal to the pre-7-year-old unconscious\nthat resides in all of us, you need to hit emotion not logic. This means\nthat a good story can help someone to reconsider deep down in their\nunconscious a feeling or attitude or seemingly immutable personality\ntrait that they can feel perhaps is somewhat dysfunctional. Stories can\nchange our natural instincts.\nWhat Can’t You Teach? 43\nThat story cannot be short and sweet. It takes a great deal of emotion\nand empathy to change a point of view in a belief system. Deciding\nto construct a 15-minute, e-learning module in which one plays\nthe sales rep and learns that honesty is the best policy, is so absurd that\nI am sorry I am referring to it at all, except that is what was proposed\nby the integrity and compliance people to whom I was speaking.\nYou can move people ever so slightly by having them have emotional\nexperiences that they can discuss with one another. Imagine a\nbook club that deals with a book about dishonesty and causes people\nin the discussion group to talk about the subject. If the book presented\ndeep dilemmas to which there were no obviously right answers, this\nwould allow people to get to and discuss their unconscious beliefs.\nSimply articulating those beliefs can be quite helpful. This is what\nclinical psychologists are really trying to do, after all. It is also what literature\nprofessors are trying to get their classes to do. Thinking about\nand talking about complex emotional issues makes personality traits\nand core beliefs something you can think about consciously.\nThe real issue, in the end, is interests. Teaching works best when\nyou teach students who agree that they really want to learn whatever\nit is you have to teach. This means making sure that students\nare preparing to do things that they want to do and actually will do.\nThat makes teaching much easier for all involved. The one-size-fits-all\ncurriculum doesn’t work because one size doesn’t fit all. Let detailoriented\npeople learn detailed kinds of things. Let artistic people learn\nartistic kinds of things. Let logical people learn logical kinds of things.\nEveryone would be much happier and all would enjoy learning a lot\nmore if we simply let people be themselves.\n\nCHAPTER 4\nTwelve Cognitive Processes That\nUnderlie Learning\nThose who know how to think need no teachers.\n—Mahatma Gandhi\nNot everything we would like to teach can be taught, as we have seen.\nSimilarly, not everything we would like to learn can be learned, especially\nif we are taking the wrong approach to learning. In the previous\nchapter we discussed what can’t be taught. Now, let’s talk about what\ncan be taught.\nOne problem in such a discussion is that we are used to (because we\nwent to school) thinking about what needs to be taught and learned\nin terms of subjects (English, math, science, etc.). We think this way\nbecause school originally was organized by professors who had specialties\nin these subject areas. These professors were scholars and they\nset up the lower schools on the basis of the specialties that they had.\nWhen I was working in artificial intelligence, I began to realize\nthat what I needed to teach the computer to do in order for it be smart\nwas a far cry from what people thought needed to be taught. People\nassumed that we needed to tell the computer facts about the world of\nthe type that children learn in school, and that this would make the\nmachine smart. (Quite recently, I attended a meeting of AI people who\nwere planning a project to allow computers to pass SAT tests as a way\nof showing that the computer was smart!)\nBut what computers lack is intelligent capabilities, not information.\nIt is easy enough to fill a machine with information, but when you are\ndone, it would be able to tell you only what you told it. (If that was what\na child did, you would think that he was brain damaged.) Intelligence\nand the learning required to create useful new knowledge are really a\nresult of an amalgamation of cognitive processes. Intelligent computers,\nand intelligent people, need those processes to be working well.\n45\n46 Teaching Minds\nWhat I mean by this, is that there is stuff we can do mentally,\nand that learning just means doing that stuff and getting better at it.\nLearning is not any one process, but many processes, depending on\nwhat you are learning.\nWhat are the cognitive processes that make up learning? If we\nwish to teach people, it is important to ask what cognitive capabilities\nwe want them to have when we are done, not what we want them to\nknow. In other words, we want to understand what we have to do in\norder to make them better able to think.\nIn this chapter, we will discuss the kinds of cognitive processes\nthat people can (and must) learn to do well. Later we will discuss how\nto best approach learning and teaching these processes.\nThere are 12 types of processes outlined here. There may be more\ntypes than these, but with these we pretty much can cover the ground\nof what human learning looks like. I have divided them into three\ngroups: conceptual processes, analytic processes, and social processes. Notice\nfirst that all the types are types of processes. Thinking is a process.\nIt is something we do. We need to see what that doing is like.\nAll these processes require practice in order to master them. You\ncannot learn to master a process without practicing it again and again.\nFeedback and coaching help one learn.\nCONCEPTUAL PROCESSES\n1. Prediction: Making a prediction about the outcome of actions\nThis is experiential learning about everyday behavior in its most\ncommon form—it includes learning about how to travel or eat or get a\ndate, for example. In its complex form it is how one learns to be a battlefield\ncommander or a horse race handicapper. One learns through\nexperience by trial and error. The cognitive issue is building up a large\ncase base and index that case base according to expectation failures, as\nI described in Dynamic Memory. We learn when predictions fail. When\nthey succeed, we fail to care about them because most of the predictions\nwe make are uninteresting (I predict the room I just left will look\nthe same when I return). Learning to predict what will happen next\nrequires repeated practice in each domain of knowledge. There is some\nTwelve Cognitive Processes That Underlie Learning 47\ntransfer across domains but not that much. (Learning to buy an airplane\nticket is somewhat related to eating in a restaurant, but not that\nclosely. You might use a credit card in each, for example, and might be\nrefused service because you are rude.)\n2. Modeling: Building a conscious model of a process\nWe need to learn how things work. A citizen knows, presumably,\nhow voting works. Someone looking for venture capital should know\nhow fund raising works. Processes need to be learned in order to effectively\nparticipate in them and in order to propose changes in them.\nBuilding a conscious model of a process matters a great deal if you\nwant to make the process work for you. If you want to get into college,\nyou need to understand how the process works. This cannot be\nlearned from experience in a serious way because one may do it only\nonce and may not be able to experience the entire process. Having\nthe process explained to you may not work that well either because\nthis will not bring an operational understanding of it (as opposed to\na more superficial understanding of it). Designing it, modifying it,\nand participating in simulations of it work much better as learning\nmethods.\n3. Experimentation: Experimentation and replanning based on\nsuccess and failure\nThis is probably the most important learning process we engage\nin while living our lives. We make life decisions and we need to know\nwhen we need to change something. There are big decisions—like\ngetting married or how to raise a child or whether to change jobs—\nand little decisions, such as changing your diet or your sleep habits.\nWe make our decisions on the basis of what has worked before and\nwhat has failed to work. We tend to make life decisions without much\nknowledge. We don’t know how our bodies work all that well and we\ndon’t really know how the world works or what it has in store for us.\nThinking about these issues and learning from failure is a pressing\nneed all through life. Learning to analyze what has worked out and\nwhat has not and why is part of living a rational life. These things can\nbe learned by living and talking about our experiences, thus creating a\ndatabase of stories that we can rely on later. We learn by talking with\n48 Teaching Minds\nothers and hearing their stories but we also learn from our own experience\nas we construct our own stories. We can learn about life experiences\nthrough reading and movies as well. We like stories in all these\nforms precisely because they focus on real-life issues. The cognitive\ntask here is story creation, comparison, indexing, and modification.\nMost conversation depends on story exchange. The more emotional a\nstory is, the more likely it is to be remembered.\n4. Evaluation: Improving our ability to determine the value of\nsomething on many different dimensions\nThere are no rights and wrongs in what we like. But there is general\nagreement about what makes a work of art great. The factors to\nbe considered are not necessarily conscious, although for experts they\ntypically are. In these more subjective and subconscious areas of life, it\nis more a matter of trying to understand what feels right than understanding\nwhy it feels right. There is a difference between being someone\nwho can make an artistic judgment and being an art expert. One\nmight learn to notice things that one had failed to notice, if someone\ntakes the time to point them out. Learning to make artistic judgments\nis about learning to notice, to describe, and to appreciate. One’s concept\nof beauty changes when one’s focus changes. Practice is a key\nidea here as is the assembling of a case base to use as a comparison\nset. Nevertheless, the comparison set is not usually conscious. One\ncan like something because it is pleasing without realizing (or caring\nabout) why it is pleasing.\nWhen we make a value judgment, we don’t necessarily know the\nvalues we have and we haven’t necessarily learned them consciously.\nWe should value human life over property but whether we do or not\nwe will find out only if the situation arises. It is tempting to try to teach\nvalues but this actually is done so early in life and in so many subtle\nways that anybody over the age of 10 is unlikely to be much affected\nby what people say to them about what they should value and what\nthey shouldn’t. Perhaps husbands should value helping their wives\nover watching football but that doesn’t mean they will. In important\nareas of life, on the job and in child raising, for example, one’s values\ncome into play. If parents believe they shouldn’t correct a child when\nhe makes a mistake in speaking, they soon will find that they have\nTwelve Cognitive Processes That Underlie Learning 49\na child who speaks poorly. The value held by the parents may well\nbe that self-confidence is more important than being articulate (“We\ndon’t want to criticize him.”). Perhaps it is. But the consequences of\none’s values manifest themselves every time a value-based decision is\nmade.\nNevertheless, we do need to learn to make value-based judgments.\nDoing this requires understanding what our values are. Confronting\na person with her own value system (one that she has unconsciously\nadopted) can help her think things out, but change is never easy.\nANALYTIC PROCESSES\n1. Diagnosis: Making a diagnosis of a complex situation by\nidentifying relevant factors and seeking causal explanations\nDiagnosis is a very important skill and one that needs to be learned\nboth in principle and separately for each domain of knowledge. Diagnosis\nof heart disease isn’t a different process in principle from diagnosis\nof a faulty spark plug in a car engine. Nevertheless, one wants a\nspecialist to do the diagnosis in each case. Why is this? Diagnosis is a\nmatter of both reasoning from evidence and understanding what to\nlook for to gather evidence. Given all the evidence, it is easy to make\na diagnosis in an area of knowledge you don’t know very well. So, the\ngathering of the evidence is the most important part. Crime analysts\nand gardeners both do diagnosis. They both reason from evidence.\nWhat separates them is knowing what constitutes important evidence\nand what does not. Here again, this comes from experienced cases.\nAnalytic processes involve attention to details that enable the\nforming of hypotheses that can be tested by a variety of methods.\nThese three pieces, determining evidence, forming hypotheses, and\ntesting hypotheses, are what is commonly referred to as the scientific\nmethod. When science is taught, it often dwells on the facts of science\nrather than the process. Diagnosis is about the process. But the process\nis not of much use without domain knowledge. Domain knowledge\nis often about causality, although that knowledge of causality may be\nsubconscious. Experts know what causes an engine to misfire so they\n50 Teaching Minds\nknow where to look to find a faulty part. Experts also know that an\nengine is misfiring in the first place. What causes what is the real issue\nin the comprehension of any given domain.\nWe learn to do diagnosis, and to understand what causes what,\nconsciously. This is knowledge that can be taught to us by experts, but\nit needs to be taught as part of the process of diagnosis. If you have a\ngoal (understanding what is broken or has gone awry is a very typical\ngoal), then it is much easier to acquire information that helps in the\npursuit of that goal than it is to acquire that same information without\nthat goal. To learn diagnosis, one must practice more and more\ncomplex cases in one area of knowledge.\n2. Planning: Learning to plan; needs analysis; conscious and\nsubconscious understanding of what goals are satisfied by what\nplans; use of conscious case- based planning\nPeople plan constantly. Often their plans aren’t very complicated.\nLet’s have lunch is a plan, after all. Sometimes they make much more\ncomplex plans. A football coach makes plans to fool the defense. They\nare called plays. A general makes battlefield plans. A businessperson\nwrites business plans. An architect draws up architectural plans. All\nthese more complex plans have a lot in common with the let’s have\nlunch plan. Namely, they have been used before or something quite\nsimilar has been used before. People rarely make plans from scratch.\nWhen they do, they find the process very difficult and often make\nmany errors.\nLearning to plan, therefore, has two components: being able to\ncreate a plan from scratch (which almost never actually happens) and\nbeing able to modify an existing plan for new purposes. The first one\nis important to learn how to do, but it is the latter ability that makes\none proficient at planning. Planning from first principles is actually\nquite difficult. Normally people just modify an old plan. Last week we\nhad steak; this week let’s try lamb chops. This doesn’t sound like rocket\nscience and it isn’t. Computer programmers write new programs\nby modifying old programs. Lawyers write contacts by modifying old\ncontracts. Doctors plan procedures by thinking about past procedures.\nIn each case, people try to improve on prior plans by remembering\nwhere these plans went wrong and then thinking about how to improve\nthem. Acquiring a case base of plans is critical. One can modify\nplans from one domain of knowledge to use in another but this is not\nTwelve Cognitive Processes That Underlie Learning 51\neasy and requires a level of abstraction that is very important to learn.\nMost creative thinking depends on this ability to abstract plans from\none field of knowledge to another. We learn to do this by practicing\nit. Teachers can help people see correspondences across domains. Abstraction\nof this sort is what creative people do best.\n3. Causation: Detecting what has caused a sequence of events\nto occur by relying on a case base of previous knowledge of\nsimilar situations (case-based reasoning)\nAll fields of knowledge study causation; biology, physics, history,\neconomics—they are all about what causes what. The fact that this is\nan object of study by academics tells us right away that it is not easy\nand no one knows for sure all of the causes and effects that there are\nin the world.\nBecause of this, acquiring a set of known causes and effects tends\nto make one an expert. A plumber knows what causes sinks to stop\nup and knows where to look for the culprit. A mechanic knows what\ncauses gas lines to leak and knows where to look. A detective knows\nwhat causes people to kill and knows where to start when solving a\nmurder case. Causal knowledge is knowledge fixed to a domain of\ninquiry. Experts have extensive case bases. Case bases are acquired by\nstarting on easy cases and graduating to more complex ones. It is important\nto discuss with others the cases one works on because this\nmakes one better at indexing them in one’s mind, enabling one to\nfind them later as needed.\n4. Judgment: Making an objective judgment\nThere are two forms of this, both involving decisions based on\ndata. The first is deciding whether you prefer Baskin Robbins or Ben\nand Jerry’s. There is no right answer. We make judgments and then\nrecord them for use later. We find ways to express our judgments (Ben\nand Jerry’s is too sweet, for example). We learn what we like by trying\nthings out. A wine expert learns about wine by drinking it and recording\nwhat he thinks so he can compare his thoughts about one wine to\nthose about a different wine later on.\nThe second form is reasoning based on evidence. A jury does this\nbut it doesn’t learn much from it. Judges, however, learn in this way,\nas do psychiatrists and businesspeople. They collect evidence, they\n52 Teaching Minds\nform a judgment, and later they may get to see whether their judgment\nis correct. When asked, they can tell you clear reasons (typically\npost hoc justifications) as to why they decided the way they did. The\nwine expert can say reasons as well, but the evidence for taste is not\nreally all that objective. (Of course, the evidence may be found after\nthe judgment is made. People are not always entirely rational.)\nTo learn to make objective judgments, one needs constant feedback\neither from a teacher or from a colleague or from reality. One\nneeds to think about what was decided and why. People who are good\nat this are good at it because they have analyzed their successes and\nfailures and they can articulate their reasoning. Learning requires repeated\npractice.\nSOCIAL PROCESSES\n1. Influence: Understanding how others respond to your requests\nand recognizing consciously and unconsciously how to improve\nthe process\nHuman interaction is one of the most important skills of all. We\nregularly interact with family, friends, colleagues, bosses, romantic interests,\nprofessors, service personnel, and strangers. Communicating\neffectively is very important to any success we might want to have in\nany area of life. But, we do not know why we say what we say, nor do\nwe really understand how we are being perceived by others. We just\ntalk and listen and go on our way. Some people are loved by everyone\nand others are despised. It is wrong to assume that we know what\nimage we project or that we are easily capable of altering the way we\nbehave so that we will be perceived differently.\nHow do we learn to become conscious of inherently unconscious\nbehavior? One can learn to behave differently if one becomes consciously\naware of the mistakes one is making. Watching others, watching\noneself, thinking about how to improve—all this helps one make\nsubconscious behavior into conscious behavior.\nWe unintentionally return to standard ways of acting in various\nsituations. A wallflower at a party doesn’t decide to be a wallflower—it\nis simply behavior she is comfortable with. If no one is harmed by\nTwelve Cognitive Processes That Underlie Learning 53\nthese subconscious choices, then there is no need to fix anything. But\noften we might behave differently in how we treat others, if we realized\nwhat we were doing. Getting along with people is a very big part\nof life. Each of us has our own distinct personality and often it doesn’t\nmatch with our own ambitions and desires. To change our behavior,\nwe need to practice new behaviors that become as natural to us as\nour old behaviors. The only way to do this is to do it. People can help\npoint out what you are doing that isn’t helpful to your needs but that\ndoes not mean you can easily change. If you want to change, you need\nto try new behaviors and practice them. This can be coached. Practicing\nnew behaviors and being critiqued can help greatly. Written communication\nis handled the same way.\n2. Teamwork: Learning how to achieve goals by using a team,\nconsciously allocating roles, managing inputs from others,\ncoordinating actors, and handling conflicts\nIt is the rare individual who works all alone. Most people need\nto work with others. Children are not naturally good at this and are\ntaught to “share.” Then they sometimes do what is called “parallel\nplay” where they play near one another doing different things. Getting\nkids to cooperate to do something together is not easy. Usually\none wants to dominate the others. There is nothing wrong with this\nper se. People are who they are and they need to assume roles in any\nteam that are consonant with their personalities. One person plays\nquarterback and another blocks. People do not have to do the same\nthing in order to work together. But they do need to get along and\nfunction as a team. This is no more true of sports than it is of the\nworkplace. People learn to work in teams by working in teams and receiving\nhelpful advice when a team is dysfunctional. Football coaches\nexplicitly teach this. More formal learning situations (like school) often\ndon’t, which is unfortunate. It really isn’t possible to get along in\nthe real world unless you can assume various roles in a team that fit\nwith who you are.\n3. Negotiation: Making a deal; negotiation/contracts\nContracts, formal and informal, are the basis of how we function.\nWe reach agreements in business, in marriage, in friendship, in a store,\n54 Teaching Minds\nand at school. Parties to those agreements have the right to complain\nif obligations are not met. Learning to make a contract, legal or not,\nis a big part of being a rational actor. To make a contract one must\nnegotiate it. Negotiation often is seen as something only politicians\nand high-powered business leaders do. But, actually, we negotiate with\nwaitresses for good service and we negotiate with our children when\nwe give them an allowance. Learning how to negotiate can be done\nonly by trying and learning from failures. The techniques tend to be\ncontext-independent, but there is, of course, special knowledge about\nreal estate and politics (for example, the relevant laws) that makes one\na better negotiator in each situation. Again, practice with coaching is\nthe ideal.\n4. Describing: Creating and using conscious descriptions of\nsituations to identify faults to be fixed\nWhen problems exist in any situation, we need to be able to describe\nand analyze them. We need to be able to describe them in order\nto get help from people who may know more about the situation than\nwe do. We need to learn to focus on the critical issues. In order to do\nthis, we need also to be able to analyze these situations to see what was\nsupposed to happen and why it isn’t happening. Consultants who try\nto fix failing businesses do this sort of thing all the time, as do doctors\nwhen consulting on difficult cases. Creating a careful description of\na situation is a skill that can be learned only through practice. This\nsometimes is described as learning an elevator speech to tell someone\nsuccinctly what you are doing. This ability is a very important part of\nunderstanding and helping others understand.\nNow let’s see what we have. First let’s list again the types of cognitive\nprocesses that underlie learning:\nConceptual processes\n1. Prediction\n2. Judgment\n3. Experimentation\n4. Evaluation\nTwelve Cognitive Processes That Underlie Learning 55\nAnalytic processes\n1. Diagnosis\n2. Planning\n3. Causation\n4. Judgment\nSocial processes\n1. Influence\n2. Teamwork\n3. Negotiation\n4. Describing\nWhat kind of stuff is this? I said above that these are cognitive processes.\nSo let’s look at them from that perspective. Let’s start with the\nanalytic processes.\nWhat does it mean to say that diagnosis is a cognitive process? It\nmeans that there are steps and these steps are based in thought rather\nthan in action. The first step may be to gather evidence, for example.\nWhile this seems like a physical act, and often it is, it is actually a\nmental act. Evidence can be gathered by asking questions, by looking\ncarefully at a scene, by listening to sounds, or by taking blood tests.\nThere are many ways to gather evidence and typically the physical\nmanifestations of evidence gathering bear no real relationship to one\nanother. Evidence gathering is a mental act, although physical actions\nmay be involved. It is a mental act that is part of a set of complex mental\nprocesses that, of course, include reasoning about the evidence,\nchecking the validity of the evidence, comparing known information\nwith previous cases that are similar, and so on. Diagnosis is a complex\nmental process. Teaching diagnosis matters because getting good at\ndiagnosis can make you a good mother, a good teacher, a good detective,\na good nearly anything you can think of. The process of diagnosis\nis constant in our mental lives.\nAre all 12 of the processes listed above like this? Clearly the other\nanalytic processes are very similar. Planning is a mental activity\nthat one gets better at by doing it. Whether you are planning a party\nor planning a career, the process involves thinking about steps and\n56 Teaching Minds\nimagining consequences to those steps. The more you plan, the better\nyou get at it. We do planning every day. It matters a great deal and\nthe better you are at it, the easier your life will go. The same is true of\nthe third mental process: analysis of causation. Knowing why something\nhappened allows us to not do it again—if we didn’t like the end\nresult—or to try to do it again, if we did, and everything in between.\nDetermining causation is a mental process that is very similar to diagnosis,\nof course.\nSo these three are all cognitive processes and they require constant\npractice. Getting better at them throughout one’s life is very important.\nI define learning as improvement in one’s cognitive processes.\nLifetime learning does not mean the continual acquisition of knowledge\nso much as it means the improvement in one’s ability to do these\nprocesses by means of the acquisition and analysis of experiences to\ndraw on.\nCHAPTER 5\nReal-Life Learning\nProjects Considered\nI learned more about the economy from one South Dakota\ndust storm than I did in all my years of college.\n—Hubert H. Humphrey\nThese days everyone has ideas about ways to improve student learning.\nThese range from having kids stretch between classes, to listening\nto Mozart, to eating right. Of course, those things won’t harm you, but\nthey really have nothing to do with learning. They are about getting\nstudents to concentrate on material that doesn’t interest them much.\nPresumably, a tedious task is made better by these kinds of things. An\ninteresting task does not need that kind of enhancement. It should be\ninteresting in and of itself.\nIn the summer of 2008, I met a most unusual man. He recently had\nretired from being the CEO of Epson Europe. Some years earlier, his\nclose friend, who was director general of a college, got sick and died.\nHis dying wish was that his friend, the Epson CEO, would succeed him\nand become president of the business school of the college. And so it\nhappened that a professional from the business world found himself\nin charge of the Business Engineering School at La Salle University in\nBarcelona, Spain. During his years at Epson he had hired many graduates\nfrom that college and others, and believed that the training they\nreceived there was highly theoretical, not practical enough or oriented\nto the real world of business. It was clear to him that students needed\na different kind of training in order to prepare them for professional\nlife. He began to talk to the faculty about teaching different kinds\nof courses, ones that were less theoretical and more related to what\npeople actually do in business. The faculty objected. Shocker.\nA provost friend of mine once said that with faculty, everything is\na la carte. What he meant was that professors never feel that they have\n57\n58 Teaching Minds\nto follow the wishes of the administration. They consider themselves\nfree agents. This former CEO, coming from a business where there really\nis someone in charge, didn’t know what to do. He talked to people\nwho talked to people and eventually he found me.\nAs a professor for 30 some odd years, I developed a healthy disrespect\nfor professors as a group. They tend to lobby for keeping their\nlives easy and that means, among other things, making sure they\ndon’t have to teach too much or teach in a way that makes them have\nto work too hard. Professors always have something more important\nto do than teach. I am not criticizing here. I would have been the first\nto whine and wail if anyone had made me teach more than one course\nevery other quarter. I considered myself a researcher, also a graduate\nseminar teacher, but classes with lots of students wanting to hear a\nlecture? Ugh.\nThe college president and I had dinner and discussed what we\ncould do together. I said we could build any program he wanted online\nas long as we didn’t need the approval of faculty to do it and we had\ngood experts available. He said he was the expert and we needed the\napproval of no one. I said it would be expensive and he said, God will\nprovide. (Did I mention this school is run by the Christian Brothers?)\nTwo months later I found myself in front of 25 faculty in Barcelona\nas I interviewed the president about what someone would have\nto know how to do in order to make them into someone whom he\nwould hire. He gave me a list. The faculty got to comment, but that\nwas about it. It was clear who was in charge.\nSo, we built a story-centered curriculum meant to teach practical\nbusiness by creating simulated experiences. The idea is to deliver\nit online around the world, using mentors who speak the students’\nlanguage. (The website is in English). No classes. No lectures. No tests.\nGraduates get an MBA degree but this curriculum doesn’t have that\nmuch in common with traditional MBA programs. The idea is to help\npeople launch their own business or go to work.\nStudents are part of teams that work to create deliverables within\na story about a situation that demands some work on their part. They\nconsult with their team members and use extensive background and\nstep-by-step help that has been created as part of the website. Mentors\nare available to answer questions and to evaluate the final work\nproduct. The projects are large enough that students need to divide up\nthe work and consult with one another on how to proceed. Eventually\nReal-Life Learning Projects Considered 59\nthey create a deliverable and either continue to work on improving\nit after receiving feedback from the mentor or move on to the next\nsubtask in the story.\nI will describe briefly the stories that the students work within\n(they each last anywhere from 6 to 9 weeks). Then I want to consider\nwhat these courses are really teaching from the perspective of the\nframework of cognitive processes that I described in Chapter 4.\nCOURSE 1: “CASH CRISIS”—\nANALYZE AND SOLVE FINANCIAL BUSINESS PROBLEMS\nThe story for this course is that a family that owns a winery business\nhires a consulting firm to help determine why the bank denied the renewal\nof a loan. The students, working in the role of assistant consultants,\nfirst conduct financial analyses to determine problems within\nthe business. Next, they conduct a root cause analysis to determine\nthe underlying causes of the problems affecting the business. Students\nthen develop solutions to address the problems and write a report outlining\nthe solutions, including 5-year financial projections.\nCOURSE 2: “GOING ONLINE”—\nTAKE A SMALL BUSINESS ONLINE\nStudents are contacted by an investor who is interested in starting an\nonline business selling gift baskets. She wants the students to help her\nplan what the business will sell in the gift baskets and to design the\nuser interface for the website. She is leaving it up to the students to\ndetermine what sort of gift basket business they want to design. Her\nimmediate concern is seeing what the site would look like, and how it\nwould function, to make sure she will have a good design to impress\nprospective buyers.\nStudents begin by interviewing prospective customers and seeing\nhow they typically buy such items online, to learn from their usage\npatterns and to determine common breakdowns in the usual process.\nNext, students produce expected user scenarios for the “personas”\nthey identify as being prospective users of the site. They then define\nfunctional and nonfunctional requirements for the site they must\n60 Teaching Minds\ndesign. They design the information architecture, including content,\nsitemap, wireframes, and low-fi prototypes, after which they test their\nprototypes on prospective users. The final step in the process is a review\nof proposals from a set of vendors who could build the site the\nstudents designed.\nCOURSE 3: MARKETING—LAUNCHING A NEW PRODUCT\nIn this story, the students belong to a product-launching team. The\ngoal is to launch a new social network for amateur performers, iSing.\ncom. Students decide which role they want to play, product marketing\nor marketing communication, and working together in teams of four,\nthey prepare the launching plan for this product. Among the activities\nthey perform are preparing job descriptions for both roles, preparing\na position strategy statement and a message architecture, preparing a\npreliminary market segmentation for the product, preparing demographics\nand psychographics of the target groups, launching a kickoff\nmeeting for the project, and preparing a launching program, including\nthe following subtasks: total product requirements, barriers to\ncustomer adoption, competitive analysis, market/customer research,\nhiring a research firm, market leverage model, communication plan,\nweb tools, branding, market research, and hiring a PR firm. Finally,\nstudents prepare a complete budget and defend the plan and the budget\nin front of the top management of the company.\nCOURSE 4: RE-ENGINEER A SUPPLY CHAIN\nStudents now play the role of junior executive in the supply chain\nmanagement department of RightByte technologies. They receive a\nreport from the CEO describing the current processes and the main\nproblems identified. With this information, students are requested to\nfind out the root causes of the problems and come up with a suggested\ncourse of action to solve them. They have to take into account the\nfollowing design principles for the new solution: customer service impact,\nimpact on cost savings, and ease of implementation.\nFrom this point on, the teams analyze each piece of the supply\nchain to make the deep diagnosis: demand/supply planning,\nReal-Life Learning Projects Considered 61\ntransportation, warehouse management, sales order management,\nand central order fulfillment. Once the diagnosis and requirements\nare well established, the teams develop a suggested solution. Finally,\ntop management requires the team to prepare a change management\nevaluation to see whether the company is prepared to undertake such\na complex project.\nCOURSE 5: INVESTMENT READINESS—\nHELP A SMALL TECHNOLOGICAL COMPANY TO SUCCESSFULLY\nRAISE FUNDS FOR AN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION IN A\nSECOND ROUND\nNext.TV is a small company that has been very successful in the local\nmarket. It has developed a software package to automate an editorial\ndepartment of a TV channel. Most of the main domestic channels\nhave already implemented the package and the company wants to go\ninternational. Students are hired as expert consultants to prepare the\ncompany for this second round of financing and to present the project\nto Venture Capital firms. Students now do several tasks that they\nhave already done in the previous modules, plus some new tasks, but\nthey do them now in an integrated manner and with much less time\nto finish them. Task to perform are: analyze starting point (P&L and\nbalance sheet), enhance the product value proposition, prepare a sales\nplan, perform a management audit, prepare the internalization plan,\nprepare financial planning, write the business plan, identify potential\nVC firms to present to, analyze offerings, and negotiate a term sheet.\nCOURSE 6: ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES IN CORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE\nThis course involves reading and discussing a specially written novel.\nThe intent of the novel is to inspire readers to wrestle with the\nproblems of the characters, who are involved in complex ethical and\nmoral decisions within the pharmaceutical industry. The novel serves\nas a starting point for the kind of active contemplation and discussion\nthat truly make people better able to think more deeply about such issues.\nThe students immerse themselves in the story of an international\n62 Teaching Minds\npharmaceutical company engaged in a hostile takeover of a smaller,\nbut highly successful, competitor. Students experience the tough negotiations,\nthe elimination of dedicated and talented individuals, and\nthe painful shuffling of roles and responsibilities that accompany major\nchange in a modern corporation. Students also confront the complicated\n(and sometimes conflicting) relationship between social responsibility,\nlegal responsibility, and profit motive, as they witness the\ncompany’s attempt to establish a new research facility in a blighted\ntown as a consequence of the merger. As students consider each episode,\nthey critique the actions and reactions of the central characters,\nadvise them on next steps, and glean lessons related to negotiation,\nchange management, legal and ethical issues in corporate governance,\nand working with other cultures.\nS TORY 7: SELLING AND IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS\nStudents begin their work as new project managers at a premier eventplanning\ncompany, World Class Events. They begin by qualifying\nand prioritizing opportunities to propose work to prospective clients,\npitching to senior management which of the proposals should receive\nthe greatest budget, based on potential profitability, likelihood of winning,\nand other relevant considerations. They create a project scope\ndocument for the sales effort, first planning and attending a simulated\nmeeting with event-planning experts to determine a vision for the\nevent, including risks and open questions for the client. They then engage\nin a role-play call with the client, introducing World Class Events\nand clarifying the project vision.\nOf course, the intent of this curriculum is to prepare students to go\nout into the business world. So, there is a natural subject orientation.\nThe subject is business. But after we acknowledge that, everything else\nis different. The curriculum was designed with the 12 cognitive processes\nin mind. Let’s see how that was accomplished.\nThe real issue in learning in any arena of knowledge is getting\nbetter at the cognitive processes that underlie that knowledge. The\nprocesses involved in learning have been with us as long as there have\nbeen humans. School, and subject-based education, is a more recent\ninvention. To understand how human learning works, we need to\nthink more deeply about how we can teach these processes.\nReal-Life Learning Projects Considered 63\nSo, we might ask, Where do the 12 cognitive processes get taught\nin this MBA program?\nFirst let’s list the cognitive processes again:\nConceptual processes\n1. Prediction\n2. Judgment\n3. Experimentation\n4. Evaluation\nAnalytic processes\n1. Diagnosis\n2. Planning\n3. Causation\n4. Judgment\nSocial processes\n1. Influence\n2. Teamwork\n3. Negotiation\n4. Describing\nNow let’s consider them one at a time.\nWhere is prediction taught in our MBA program?\nIn course 1 (cash crisis), students have to create a financial plan.\nAny planning document is a serious attempt at prediction. Prediction\nis covered in a different way in course 2. In that course, students need\nto predict how users will behave on a website. In course 3, students\nneed to predict the effects of a marketing campaign and predict what\nwill work and what will not work in a product launch. In course 4, students\nneed to predict how changes they make in the supply chain will\nimprove the process. In course 5, students are developing a business\nmodel, which is in itself a prediction that certain decisions and behaviors\nwill make money. In course 6, students must predict the effects\nof various changes in an organization and must predict the behavior\nof the people with whom they will negotiate. In course 7, students\n64 Teaching Minds\npredict which sales pitches will work as well as predicting various costs\nand benefits associated with their product.\nIn fact, it seems obvious that prediction is at the very heart of this\nMBA program. But so are all the other cognitive processes. Students\nare always working in teams and are always trying to influence their\npeers, their superiors, their customers, and so on. They are in constant\nnegotiations and they are creating all kinds of plans—financial plans,\nmarketing plans, and business plans. They are constantly diagnosing\nproblems in the various stories and constantly creating documents as\nwork products (describing). They must determine the cause of various\nproblems in each story and evaluate solutions to those problems. They\nmake judgments about what to do, and what is working and what isn’t,\nin each story and they create models of proposed solutions. Each new\nsolution they propose is, in effect, an experiment, and they must evaluate\nthe results of each experiment as they proceed.\nNow let’s reconsider what it means to teach and what is important\nto teach within the context of a good curriculum. One might\nhave expected, given that there are 12 cognitive processes that must\nbe learned, that each project in the curriculum would be put clearly\ninto one of categories. The schooling mentality naturally leads to the\nidea that if diagnosis is important, then we should offer a course in\ndiagnosis. But you can’t diagnose randomly and you can’t teach students\nto do diagnosis in the absence of an acknowledgment of their\nreal interest and goals independent of a context. While diagnosis is\nfundamentally the same process whether you are plumber, a doctor, or\na businessperson, there is also much to learn about the context of the\ndiagnosis, and real students with real goals will fall asleep while hearing\nabout diagnosis in one context, whereas they will perk up while\nactually doing diagnosis in a context they find fascinating.\nWe have designed this curriculum to teach the 12 cognitive processes\nwithin the context that was decided upon by the students. No\none is forced to take an MBA program. The students are those who\nwant to run their own business or work within the context of a large\nbusiness. It is the job of the curriculum designer (and the teacher),\ntherefore, to teach them how to think well within that context.\nNow I am not saying that this is not done (or at least cannot be\ndone) within traditional schooling. Sometimes it is. A good history\nteacher does in fact teach about diagnosis and causation and planning.\nOne can think about the Battle of Waterloo and learn a great\nReal-Life Learning Projects Considered 65\ndeal about planning, and influence, and causation, and teamwork.\nBut while this could be true of a good history course, it often is\nin no way actually the case. If history courses were designed to teach\nstudents to think within the context of history, they would be much\nmore important than they now are. As long as we think that history is\nabout getting the facts about who signed what declaration when, we\nare missing the forest for the trees from a teaching point of view.\nNow, of course, some subjects lend themselves very easily to emphasis\nof the 12 cognitive processes. Science courses could, for example,\nbe entirely about experimentation or diagnosis or causation,\nand they would be very useful if they were. But instead we encourage\nlearning the facts about who did what experiment and we teach formulas\nto be memorized and we teach about equations. Experimentation\nis indeed a very exciting subject. (Ask any 2-year-old who experiments\nwith what best goes in his mouth on a daily basis.) But\nschooling manages to make it a very dull subject by teaching who did\nwhat experiment when.\nOne reason that we have managed to create dullness out of material\nthat can be inherently interesting is the absurd emphasis on testing\nthat has dominated the world of education in the past years. Below\nare three questions (quite typical ones) from an AP psychology exam.\nIvan P. Pavlov is famous for his research on\n(A) teaching machines.\n(B) perceptual learning.\n(C) forward conditioning.\n(D) classical conditioning.\n(E) backward conditioning.\nA stimulus that elicits a response before the experimental\nmanipulation is a (an)\n(A) response stimulus (RS).\n(B) unconditioned stimulus (UCS).\n(C) generalized stimulus (GS).\n(D) conditioned stimulus (CS).\n(E) specific stimulus (SS).\n66 Teaching Minds\nErikson proposed that trust or mistrust develops during the\n(A) muscular-anal stage.\n(B) locomotor-genital stage.\n(C) latency stage.\n(D) oral-sensory stage.\n(E) maturity stage.\nPsychology is all about experimentation, but the questions here are\nabout facts about previous experiments, which is very different from\nlearning to design and perform an experiment about something that\npersonally interests you. Psychology teachers cannot teach students\nhow to create a hypothesis and experiment to find out whether it is\ntrue, unless they go around the existing curriculum. Since teachers are\njudged by their students’ results on AP tests, this is hardly likely.\nAnother problem here is that only some of the 12 cognitive processes\nare conscious. Others are hidden from our conscious minds.\nIf school were to actively try to teach diagnosis, for example, soon\nenough there would be the 18 principles of diagnosis or a test about\nwho said what about diagnosis. There probably wouldn’t be much actual\ndiagnosis unless something drastically changed our conception of\nwhat schooling should look like.\nThe major problem with how we think about teaching is our conception\nof what it means to teach, as well as our conception of what it\nmeans to learn. In school we “know” that one has to learn math and\nscience and literature. I am asserting here that it is that notion, that\nthere are these specific subjects to teach, that has ruined our schools.\nThere are abilities to teach, not subjects.\nAcademics designed the school system. To them, it seemed natural\nthat the subjects that they were experts on should be taught in\nhigh school. Such a simple thought has created a major problem. 1\nEducation ought not be subject-based but, in a sense, we can’t help\nbut think of it that way because we all went to schools that were subject-based.\nEven corporate training, which need not be subject-based,\ntends to be viewed in that way as well, simply because that is the way\nwe have always looked at education owing to our own experiences in\nschool.\nOnce you set up the learning question in terms of subjects that need\nto be taught, it is very tempting to use the old tried and true, Why\nReal-Life Learning Projects Considered 67\ndon’t we just tell them the facts and any underlying theories? The knowledge\nmetaphor, the one that says that teachers know some stuff that students\ndon’t, naturally leads teachers to tell students what they know.\nNow let’s consider corporate training.\nThe companies that contract with my company 2 to build courses\nknow that we will not use the learning by telling method. Presumably\nthey are frustrated with the results that the telling method has produced\nin courses that have been built for them by others. (In fact, they\nrefer to it as “death by PowerPoint.”) This is why they come to us. Still\nthey can’t help but ask the same subject-based question. How could\nthey not? It is all they know. They went to school. They see the world\nin the way that school taught them to see it.\nThey don’t ask the questions they should ask because they can’t.\nWe need to transform badly formed educational questions into properly\nformed ones. We need to transform subject-based questions into\ncognitive process-based questions. This means changing statements\nabout the need to manage client relationships into statements about\ncognition, and statements about product launch into ones about cognition,\nand so on. What does it mean to make such transformations?\nIt means asking what one does when one manages client relationships\nor when one launches a product. This is, of course, exactly what we\nask clients in our first meeting with them. For example, we ask: What\ndoes one do when one launches a product?\nWhat I plan to do here is reveal what we do next, namely, the subject\nto cognitive ability transformation process. We must do the transformation\nproperly and then make clear what one does in course design\nafter one has figured out what really needs to be taught.\nLet’s start simple. Let’s imagine we want to train insurance adjusters\nto decide what compensation a policy owner is entitled to after a\nhurricane hits his property. (Yes, I do live in Florida, but I can’t say I\ncare much about this process personally.) I found this on the Internet\ncovering this subject:\nCatastrophe Adjusting Refresher\nCourse Description: This is a course package comprised of three\ncourses plus a bonus section and downloadable documents.\nOne of the three courses is this:\n68 Teaching Minds\nCatastrophe Adjusting Skills and Techniques\nCourse Description: This is a course package comprised of seven\ncourses plus two bonus sections and a number of downloadable\ndocuments.\nThis online class is for individuals who are new to adjusting\ncatastrophes, such as hurricanes, windstorms, and tornadoes.\nThe course is broken down into two key sections: “Getting\nPrepared for Adjusting” and “The Actual Adjusting Process.”\nThe first section includes a number of course components and\nbackground knowledge that can be done in preparation for any\ncatastrophe. The second part of the class takes you through\nall the steps and processes required for adjusting residential\nproperties. This online package includes everything listed under\ncourse topics.\nCourse Topics:\n• Insurance Basics\n• Tools of the Trade\n• Working with Digital Photos\n• Residential Construction Basics\n• Claim File Components\n• Homeowners Policy Interpretation\n• Property Adjusting 101\n• Getting organized\n• Claim reporting\nCourse Length: 8 hours\nAudience: Property adjusters who are new to processing and\nadjusting catastrophe claims and need the knowledge and skills\nrequired to be successful on the job.\nOne thing that jumps out here is the time. In 8 hours, the above\ntopics will all be covered.\nWow! Assuming an hour for each subject, this means you can\nlearn insurance basics, or residential construction basics, in an hour\nif you take this course. What this means in practice, I assume, is that\nReal-Life Learning Projects Considered 69\nthere will be some text to read and some questions to answer to make\nsure that you have read the text. Personally, I doubt that one could\nlearn much about any of these subjects by oneself in 8 hours (or even\n8 days.) Clearly, they are teaching vocabulary and a few facts. Most of\nit will be forgotten.\nNow suppose the insurance industry had come to me and asked\nmy company to build a course that covered these topics. What would\nI say? (Apart from: Are you nuts?—not in 8 hours.)\nI would start by asking what is hard about insurance adjusting. At\nthe same time, I would have already assumed that this was basically a\ndiagnosis task.\nDiagnosis is a complex cognitive process that has three important\nparts. The most important part is the end result. All successful diagnoses\nresult in an answer (cancer, stopped up sewer line, misfiring spark\nplug, paranoia, etc.). These results are taken from a list of acceptable\nanswers and typically are not in any way inventive. The second part\nis the case. A prototypical case for all possible results typically is compared\nwith the current case. A match determines the result. The third\npart is the evidence. To construct a case, one must gather evidence.\nWhen more than one prototypical case matches the situation, more\nevidence needs to be gathered in order to differentiate the cases that\nmight match. Doctors call this differential diagnosis.\nHow does one learn to do diagnosis? One must know the prototypical\ncase, which often takes years for one to acquire naturally\nthrough experience. One must know how to gather evidence, and\nwhat constitutes evidence, and one must know the possible set of results.\nAll of this takes a long time to learn. But the process itself is very\nmuch the same no matter what you are diagnosing. So, one question\nwe would ask was whether the students in the course had any experience\ndiagnosing anything. It is easier to teach diagnosis to people who\nhave done it before even if the subject matter is different this time.\nAnother question we would ask is how much the students knew about\nthe basics of the subject matter since it is easier to teach diagnosis to\nthose who already know the subject matter.\nSo when I ask what is hard about insurance adjusting, I have a\ngood idea of what the answer may be. It is probably in one of these\nthree things. Is it difficult to learn all the kinds of cases that there are\nand what differentiates one from another? This depends on how many\n70 Teaching Minds\ntypes of cases there are. Is it hard to gather evidence properly? Probably.\nIt usually is. Is it hard to know all the possible results? It might\nnot be. It might be hard to decide on a result, however, since the result\nis usually to pay some amount of money, so how much money would\nbe the key question. All this takes practice, so what we really need to\nknow is where the main areas of practice should be.\nSo now we have a real question to ask:\nQ1: How can we practice gathering evidence, learning about\nprototypical cases, and knowing how to determine the correct\nfinal result in insurance adjusting?\nNotice that this is a very different question from asking what an\ninsurance adjuster knows and then asking how to tell students what\nthey should know.\nMaking the transformation from the list of knowledge given above\nby the online course offerers into Q1 is the real issue in transforming\nsubject-based education into cognitive process- based education.\nLet’s discuss a different type of example. My company was invited\ninto a technical college in Peru to discuss how to teach accounting.\nWhy would you want to teach accounting? I asked. Because the students\nneed to know it, I was told. Why? I said. Because they need it in their\nwork. So I changed the subject. I asked, What work do most people do\nwhen they graduate from your school?\nIt turns out most of their graduates ran fast-food restaurants. Then\nwhy do they need to learn accounting? They need it in order to run a restaurant.\nI am sure there is some accounting done as part of running a\nrestaurant, but surely not every part of accounting is needed. And, I\nasked, Do you actually teach how to run a restaurant?\nOf course they didn’t. Why not? Because accounting is an academic\nsubject and managing fast-food employees and ordering meat\nare not. They hire an accounting professor and he knows accounting\nand knows nothing about running a restaurant. Even a practical technical\nschool gets caught up in subject-based education in part because\nit hires graduates from that system who know only what they themselves\nwere taught.\nWhat are the cognitive processes involved in running a fast-food\nrestaurant? Let’s see which are relevant.\nReal-Life Learning Projects Considered 71\nConceptual processes\n1. Prediction YES\n2. Modeling YES\n3. Experimentation YES\n4. Evaluation YES\nAnalytic processes\n1. Diagnosis YES\n2. Planning YES\n3. Causation YES\n4. Judgment YES\nSocial processes\n1. Influence YES\n2. Teamwork YES\n3. Negotiation YES\n4. Describing YES\nHmm. All of them. How can this be?\nManaging a business, any business, requires one to influence employees,\nnegotiate with suppliers, plan future moves, determine what\nisn’t working, teach employees how to work together, make judgments\nabout people and processes, and so on.\nAll this should give a hint about how to approach a business that\nwants to teach its employees to do their jobs properly. One must teach\neach of the 12 processes, but they need to be taught in the actual context\nof what people will do when they graduate. This does not mean\nthat for every problem there are 12 courses that need to be created.\nWhile you might need to predict an employee’s behavior, this does\nnot mean there should be a prediction course. This is not a problem\nbecause there never is such a course. A businessperson has to make\njudgments, and determine causes of problems, and so on, so maybe we\nshould have courses in each of those processes. But this makes no sense.\nWe must teach people to deal with the real-life issues that arise\nin any situation they are preparing to work in. In other words, the\n72 Teaching Minds\ndesigner of a course on how to manage a restaurant must focus on\nthe typical goal conflict situations that a new manager would have to\nconfront. The course designer must create a fictional situation where\nit is necessary to convince an employee to do something or to find out\nwhy something that was asked of an employee did not happen.\nThe magic word is scenario. Scenarios are like plays. Things happen\nand you have to deal with them. A well-written scenario makes sure\nthat all of the processes that could be at all relevant to what you want\nto teach, occur in this new context. In a reasonable education system,\nstudents would have been practicing all of these processes all of their\nlives. But we do not have a reasonable education system. We have\none based in subjects. So our cognitive processes are not rehearsed\nover time in different contexts by constant practice. Instead we learn\nknowledge about subjects.\nTo remedy this, a course designer (and a teacher if the teacher has\nthat freedom) must make sure that as many of the cognitive processes\nas are relevant to a situation naturally occur within the scenario being\nconstructed to simulate what will happen in real life later on. Not every\nsituation requires diagnosis, but many do. Not every situation has\na goal conflict or forces one to make predictions or plans, but many\ndo. If what needs to be taught naturally lends itself to working on\nany of the 12 cognitive processes, then the training being built must\nconcentrate on that. If there could be diagnosis, then there should be\ntraining in diagnosis in that context, and that training must supersede\nthe garnering of facts.\nSchools are tough to change. We are trying, but the subject-based\neducators have a few hundred years head start. However, in designing\nnew training, it is quite possible to reorient subject-based courses and\nturn them into cognitive process-based courses that are much more\nsatisfying to both the teacher and the student.\nCHAPTER 6\nA Socratic Dialogue\nSit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up\nevery conceived notion, follow humbly wherever and whatever\nabysses nature leads, or you will learn nothing.\n—Thomas Huxley\nSlave Boy: So it really doesn’t matter how you classify a teaching/\nlearning problem because there are many methods that could\napply, correct?\nSocrates: And what follows from this?\nSlave Boy: That it is not the classification that matters but the\nmethods entailed in that classification.\nSocrates: And what do all these methods have in common?\nSlave Boy: They all involve practice\nSocrates: And what else?\nSlave Boy: Real experience.\nSocrates: And how is experience stored?\nSlave Boy: Through cases.\nSocrates: Expressed how?\nSlave Boy: As stories\nSocrates: So what follows from all this?\nSlave Boy: That the methodology entailed in each classification of\nlearning types is not the real issue.\nSocrates: And what is the real issue?\nSlave Boy: Practice\nSocrates: And?\nSlave Boy: Dialogue\nSocrates: Why dialogue?\nSlave Boy: Because it is through dialogue that stories are solidified\nand indexed\nSocrates: So the classification of learning types doesn’t really matter\nthen, does it?\n73\n74 Teaching Minds\nSlave Boy: Oh no, dear teacher, I beg to differ. The classification helps\nus think about the real issues in education.\nSocrates: Indeed.\nCHAPTER 7\nKnowledge-Based Education vs.\nProcess-Based Education\nDiagnosis is not the end, but the beginning of practice.\n—Martin H. Fischer\nIn our society we have set up schools to teach knowledge. We concern\nourselves with what facts children know, we test to make sure they\nknow them, and then we complain that the schools are failing when\nthey don’t. This idea is so ingrained in our way of looking at schooling\nthat when people like me complain about it, we are seen as people\nwho are rambling around muttering to ourselves.\nThere are so many people having anxiety attacks about what kids\nknow, it seems one can find an article about it in every news segment\non education.\nI happened on an article in Huffington Post written by someone\nnamed Schweitzer who is listed as “having served at the White\nHouse during the Clinton Administration as Assistant Director for\nInternational Affairs in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.”\nHere is a piece of what he said:\nThe health care debate cannot be understood in historic context\nbecause many Americans have never heard of Thomas Jefferson.\nExtrapolating from state surveys, only 14% of American high\nschool students can name who wrote the Declaration of\nIndependence. Nearly 75% do not know that George Washington\nwas our first president. . . . We can say that our educational\nsystem has failed when the vast majority of American students\ndo not know enough to pass an exam to qualify as American\ncitizens.\nThis is an astonishing statement.\n75\n76 Teaching Minds\nWhy do we have such a failed system? Could it be the policies of\npresidents like Clinton, who pursued a policy of never offending the\nteachers unions by doing anything threatening to them, like changing\nthe curriculum?\nOr, could it be that people such as this writer define education\nin terms of random facts they wished everyone knew? The problem\nis not that people don’t know who Thomas Jefferson was. If citizens\nknew who he was, would that mean that they could think clearly and\nnot be influenced by all the special interests who were trying to tell\nthem what to think? If they knew who George Washington was, what\nexactly would they know about him? That he could never tell a lie?\nThis is obviously untrue, and many have written about what a good\nliar he actually was. That he was a brilliant general? There is lots of\nevidence against that. That he owned 300 slaves? This is not usually\nmentioned. That he married a rich woman probably so he could get\nher land? Historians discuss this. Schools never do. Nevertheless, people\nare upset because our students don’t know our national myths and\nsome random facts.\nThe real issue in the healthcare debate is that the general public\ncan’t think clearly. That would have a simple explanation. The schools\ndon’t even try to teach people to think clearly.\nI mentioned President Clinton above, but really all U.S. presidents\nare culpable. It may not be their fault. Certainly they are given terrible\ninformation.\nLamar Alexander, former Secretary of Education (under George\nH.W. Bush) was speaking in the U.S. Senate recently on restoring\nteaching history to its “rightful place” and making sure that history\nwas part of the NCLB act. Here is a quote from him from 2006:\nJust one example of how far we are from helping our children\nlearn what they need to know. The fourth grade national\nreport card test asked students to identify the following\npassage, “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men\nare created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator\nwith certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life,\nLiberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.” Students were given\nfour choices: Constitution, Mayflower Compact, Declaration\nof Independence, and Articles of Confederation. Less than\nKnowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 77\nhalf the students answered correctly that that came from the\nDeclaration of Independence. Another question said, “Imagine\nthat you landed in Philadelphia in the summer of 1776. Describe\nan important event that is happening there.” Nearly half\nthe students couldn’t answer the question correctly that the\nDeclaration of Independence was being signed.\nPoliticians never seem to get it about education. What history do\nstudents “need to know”? None, actually, unless they plan on being\nhistorians, or maybe senators. Now I realize this is a radical point of\nview, but history is not something anyone needs to know.\nWhy not?\nBecause knowing what happened in Philadelphia in 1776 does\nnot in fact make you a better citizen, no matter what Alexander says.\nRandom historical “facts” do not make one a critical thinker about\nhistory nor do they promote clear thinking about current political\nissues. Such “facts” are almost always used by politicians to justify\nwhatever it is they already believe. Understanding how human events\ntypically flow is, in fact, quite valuable, but that has more to do with\nunderstanding human nature and prior circumstances than it does\nwith memorizing facts that politicians deem important to know. A\ngood citizen would be one who carefully considered the issues when\nvoting. That would mean being able to diagnose problems and evaluate\nproposed solutions. But that would produce a citizenry that could\nask hard questions of politicians, which is probably not what these\npoliticians are aiming for.\nIn 1776 we had a bunch of politicians who, if the present set are\nany example, surely were voting for their own special interests. The\nfact that we, as a country, feel the need to make them into folk heroes\ndoes not make it one bit more likely they were any better or worse\nthan the current people who govern us. What Alexander is really arguing\nfor is more indoctrination—more informing students what to\nthink instead of teaching them how to think.\nIt would be nice if one simply could point a finger and say it is all\nthe politicians’ fault. They really don’t want people to think all that\nclearly. But politicians are only part of the problem.\nRecently, a report was issued about the teaching of mathematics,\nstating:\n78 Teaching Minds\nStudents who complete Algebra II are more than twice as\nlikely to graduate from college compared to students with less\nmathematical preparation. 1\nThe natural assumption here is that we must hurry up and teach\nmore Algebra II, of course. Except that obviously is not what is going\non; it just serves the interests of those who wrote the report to put it\nthat way. Here is another statement from that report:\nStudents who depended on their native intelligence learned less\nthan those who believed that success depended on how hard\nthey worked.\nThe claim is simply this: If you work harder, you get into college.\nNow the question is: Why are the writers of this report claiming that\nthe thing that students have to work harder at is Algebra II?\nIt is easy enough to see why this panel decided that. At stake was a\n$100 million federal budget request for Math Now, and the people who\nwere on the panel were people who would receive that funding. University\nprofessors issue reports asking for grant money to be approved\nthat state that the nation will not succeed without that grant money.\nVested interests are nothing new. I am sometimes amazed that no one\npoints this stuff out, however. It is well established that everyone must\nknow algebra. The fact that this is well established by those who make\nmoney on the teaching of algebra is never brought up by the New York\nTimes, which published a lead article on the report, or by anyone else,\nit seems.\nMy favorite part of the Times article was the following:\nDr. Faulkner, a former president of the University of Texas at\nAustin, said the panel “buys the notion from cognitive science\nthat kids have to know the facts.”\nDr. Faulkner, let me point out, is a chemist, and I am pretty sure\nhe doesn’t really know much about cognitive science. But cognitive\nscience has been used of late to justify a great deal of what is wrong\nin education. E.D. Hirsch, an English professor at the University of\nVirginia, made a career of making lists of stuff every kid should know.\nWhen cognitive scientists trashed this work as nonsense, he cited the\nKnowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 79\nidea that one needs background knowledge in order to read, which is\nboth true and a product of various works in cognitive science.\nHirsch was made to look like a fool so often that he resorted to hiring\na cognitive science professor at Virginia, who has written a book\njustifying the same nonsense with more cognitive science facts. 2\nThere is plenty of work in cognitive science that shows that background\nknowledge helps people interpret the world around them, and\nthus reading, for example, is facilitated by having knowledge about\nthe world about which you are reading. This idea, however, does not\nimply that ramming facts down a kid’s throat is the way for them to\nacquire that background knowledge. Knowledge acquisition is a natural\nresult of engaging in cognitive processes that are being employed\nto satisfy a truly held goal.\nIf you are trying to find your way around a city, you will learn the\nstreets of that city and develop what is called a cognitive map. If you\ntry to memorize those same streets, it simply won’t work. Real knowledge\nis acquired as a natural part of an employed cognitive process in\nservice of a goal. But Hirsch and Willingham know nothing about cognitive\nprocesses. They only know, and talk about, how best to acquire\nmore facts. Politicians listen to them and there are more tests to make\nsure those facts have been acquired. No one remembers Algebra II or\nmuch about the Founding Fathers because that stuff is mostly facts\nacquired independent of any real goals that will employ those facts.\nKnowledge is not the real issue in education or in mental life. The\nreal issue is developing facility with doing various cognitive processes.\nKnowledge comes along for free with practice of these processes in\nspecific domains.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever that accumulation of facts and\nbackground knowledge are the same thing. In fact, there is plenty of\nevidence to the contrary. Facts learned out of context, and apart from\nactual real-world experience that is repeated over and over, are not\nretained.\nWhy don’t kids like school? Because we teach them knowledge\nthat they know they won’t need. How do they know this? They know\nthat their parents don’t know this stuff—that is how. Many kids don’t\nlike math much and it is clear why. They find it boring and irrelevant\nto anything they care about doing. If we think math is so important,\nthen why not teach it within a meaningful context, where it actually\nis used? There is plenty of evidence that shows that teaching math\n80 Teaching Minds\nwithin a real and meaningful context works a whole lot better than\nshoving it down their throats and following that with a multiple\nchoice test. But for the vast majority of citizens, Algebra II is never\nused.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever that says that a nation that is\ntrailing in math test scores will somehow trail in GDP or whatever it\nis we really care about. This is just plain silly, but we keep repeating\nthe mantra that we are behind Korea in math as if it has been proven\nthat this matters in some way. Nothing of the sort has been proven.\nWhat is true is that there are a great many vested interests that need\nto keep teaching math: tutoring companies, testing companies, math\nteachers, book publishers, and many others who make lots of money\nwhen people are scared into thinking that their kid won’t get into college\nbecause he or she is bad at Algebra II. Nearly every grownup has\nforgotten whatever algebra he or she ever learned to pass those silly\ntests, so it is clear that algebra is meaningless for adult life. Any college\nprofessor who is honest will tell you that algebra almost never comes\nup in any college course, and when it does come up it usually needn’t\nbe there in the first place.\nSo, math isn’t important and history isn’t important. What is\nimportant?\nTests. Tests are very important. Not to me, of course, but my vote\nisn’t being counted.\nThe past two presidents have been obsessed with raising test scores.\nI am assuming this is true because some political analysts somewhere\nhave determined that the general public believes in the significance of\nraising tests scores and will vote for politicians who are able to show\nthat they have done it. There can’t be any other reason. Try taking\nthose tests. Most of them are available online. See how well you can\ndo at them.\nBut what could really be wrong with testing and emphasizing test\nscores?\nTESTING TEACHES THAT THERE ARE RIGHT ANSWERS\nThe problem is that in real life, the important questions don’t have answers\nthat are clearly right or wrong. “Knowing the answer” has made\nschool into Jeopardy. It is nice to win a game show, but important\nKnowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 81\ndecisions are made through argumentation and force of reason—not\nby knowing the right answer. People who know a lot are generally\nquite smart. I could do well at Jeopardy as could most professors, I\nwould think. But we are not successful intellectuals because we know a\nlot of facts. We know a lot of facts because we are successful intellectuals.\nPeople have got this backwards.\nConsider athletes. A great baseball player and a great basketball\nplayer, it can be assumed, also will be very good at lifting weights. But\nthey did not become good at lifting weights and then become great\nathletes. It was the other way around. They had a natural talent for\nhitting a ball or shooting baskets and then they had to get stronger in\norder to compete with others who had the same talents. The talent is\nthe reason—not the weightlifting. Michael Jordan, a really great athlete,\ncouldn’t become a successful baseball player because he couldn’t\nhit a curve ball. That talent had nothing to do with the athletic ability\nthat made him a great basketball player. Hitting a curve ball is a\ndifferent kind of talent. His weightlifting ability was the same either\nway. I know a lot of facts and I am talented at designing educational\nsoftware. The facts I know do not help with the talent. But the more\neducational software I design in different domains of knowledge, the\nmore facts I pick up.\nWhen we look at people who are knowledgeable and confuse that\nwith people who can think well, we totally miss the point about education.\nEducation ought not be focused on imparting facts any more\nthan athletic training ought to be focused on weightlifting. You learn\nto hit a ball by hitting one and you learn to think clearly by thinking.\nFocusing on the 12 cognitive processes I have outlined, rather than\nfocusing on fact acquisition, helps one learn to think.\nTESTING TEACHES THAT SOME SUBJECTS ARE MORE\nIMPORTANT THAN OTHERS\nThe tests are small in number. If there were thousands to choose from,\nthen perhaps people could get tested in fiber optics instead of history.\nBut the system has determined which subjects are the most important.\nThe system made that determination in 1892. Some things have\nchanged in the world since then. There are a few new subjects—psychology,\ncomputers, medicine, business, and law, for example. Many\n82 Teaching Minds\nnew sciences and social sciences came into being after 1892. But none\nof those will ever make it into the sacred group of math, science, English,\neconomics, and history because everyone seems to think that the\nbig five were handed down on tablets to Moses.\nAnd everyone is sure that their favorite subject is the most important\none, be it history, literature, math, or science. Math and science\nare having a big moment as I write this. We hear that the nation does\nnot produce enough students interested in math and science. Something\nmust be done.\nI was a math major in college. I got 98 on every math Regents test\noffered. (I lived in New York where testing ruled in the world in the\n1950s too.) My mother always asked where the other two points went.\nI grew up to be a computer science professor. I am not a math phobe.\nBut neither am I a math proponent. I have never used math in my\nprofessional life.\nI always start any discussion on education by asking if the person\nI am talking with knows the quadratic formula. One out of one hundred\nknows it. (The last few times I asked, the people included the\nhead of a major testing service, the governor of a U.S. state, various\nstate legislators, and 200 high school principals.) Then why do we\nteach this obviously useless piece of information to every student in\nthe world? Because math is important, of course.\nWhy?\nAs a person who was involved with graduate admissions for 30\nyears at three of the top ten universities in the country, I know what\nthis hysteria is actually about. Nearly all applicants to graduate computer\nscience programs (which is what I know—but it is true in most\nfields of engineering and science) are foreign nationals. We wonder\nwhy American kids aren’t interested in these fields—which is a reasonable\nenough question. But then we have come up with an extraordinary\nanswer.\nWhat we say is that we must teach math and science better in high\nschool when what we mean is that it would be nice to have some more\nAmerican-born scientists.\nDo we really believe that the reason that there are so many foreign\napplicants to U.S. graduate programs is that they teach math and science\nbetter in other countries? China and India provide most of the\napplicants. They also have most of the world’s people. And many of\nKnowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 83\nthose people will do anything to live in the United States. So they cram\nmath down their own throats, knowing that it is a ticket to America.\nVery few of these applicants come from Germany, Sweden, France, or\nItaly. Is this because they teach math badly there or is it because those\npeople aren’t desperate to move to the United States?\nU.S. students are not desperate to move to the United States, so\nwhen you suggest to them that they numb themselves with formulas\nand equations, they refuse to do so. The right answer would be to\nmake math and science actually interesting, but with those awful tests\nas the ultimate arbiter of success, this is very difficult to do. Math and\nscience are not important subjects. There, I said it. Start the lynching.\nOne can live a happy life without ever having taken a physics course\nor knowing what a logarithm is.\nBut being able to reason on the basis of evidence actually is important.\nYou cannot live well without this skill (or any of the other\ncognitive processes I have been writing about). Diagnosis is science\nas it actually is practiced by scientists. Science is not a bunch of\nstuff to be memorized. It is the fact-based tests that cause this problem.\nWe don’t need more math and science. We need more people\nwho can think.\nTESTING FOCUSES TEACHERS ON WINNING NOT TEACHING\nMany teachers are extremely frustrated by the system they have found\nthemselves a part of. They cannot afford to spend time teaching a\nstudent or getting a concept across if the issues being taught are not\non the tests. They are judged on the basis of test scores. So any rational\nteacher gives up teaching and becomes a kind of test preparation\ncoach. Testing has become a kind of contest between schools, much\nlike football. I like football. But the football mentality that envelops\nour concept of schooling is a disaster.\nTake a look at this excerpt of an article taken from my local\npaper. What our educators are worrying about is winning the game.\nUnfortunately, the game has nothing to do with educating students\nand everything to do with test scores, which are probably less valuable\nthan football scores in predicting anything about the future of\nchildren’s lives.\n84 Teaching Minds\nMartin County School District won’t settle for B\nJuly 27, 2007\nSTUART—The Martin County School District was just short\nof earning a perfect report card from the state in late June.\nBut the district, which earned 18 A’s and one B, has a chance\nto earn straight A’s. School officials are appealing J.D. Parker\nSchool of Science, Math & Technology’s B grade. The Stuart\nelementary school had enough points to be considered an “A”\nschool, but because the lowest 25 percent of the school’s students\ndidn’t make learning gains, the state dropped the grade to a B.\n. . . .\nMartin had the second-highest percentage of A schools\namong the state’s 67 counties. Gilchrist County had the highest\npercentage of A’s, though the county in northeastern Florida only\nhas four schools.\nThe district is also filing an appeal for Warfield Elementary\nin Indiantown. The school received an A, but did not make\nadequate yearly progress under the federal No Child Left Behind\nAct, state data shows.\nThe result of all this is that teachers are now being “held accountable”\nfor their teaching, which is another way of saying, Get those test scores\nup or else.\nThe following is from an article on the front page of the New York\nTimes (December 23, 2007):\nMr. Obama, for instance, in a speech last month in New\nHampshire denounced the law (NCLB) as “demoralizing our\nteachers.” But he also said it was right to hold all children to\nhigh standards. “The goals of this law were the right ones,” he\nsaid.\nWhen Mr. Edwards released an education plan earlier this\nyear, he said the No Child law needed a “total overhaul.” But he\nsaid he would continue the law’s emphasis on accountability.\nAnd at the elementary school in Waterloo, Mrs. Clinton said\nshe would “do everything I can as senator, but if we don’t get it\ndone, then as president, to end the unfunded mandate known as\nNo Child Left Behind.”\nKnowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 85\nBut she, too, added: “We do need accountability.”\nAccountability must play well in Peoria because every politician is for\nit.\nAccountability must mean to voters, I assume, that teachers will\nbe measured by how well they teach their students. Political candidates,\nalways willing to hop on an uncontroversial point of view, are\nall quite certain that the voters know what they are talking about. No\nmatter how stupid NCLB is, no matter how mean spirited, no matter\nhow awful for both teachers and students, its very horror rests on the\npremise that no one seems to be disputing that the federal government\nhas the right to tell the schools what to teach and to see whether\nthey are indeed teaching it.\nHow is this premise wrong?\n• It assumes that all schools should teach the same\nsubjects.\n• It assumes that some subjects are more important than\nother subjects.\n• It assumes that all important subjects can be easily tested.\n• It assumes that seeing who did better than whom in\nschool is an intrinsic part of the educational process.\n• It assumes that all children have the same educational\nneeds.\nLet’s take them one by one.\nALL SCHOOLS SHOULD TEACH THE SAME SUBJECTS\nWhy is this wrong?\nFirst, it is wrong because subjects aren’t what should be taught.\nBut even if one follows the view presented in this book that the issue\nis cognitive processes and not subjects, cognitive processes need to be\napplied to actual domains, that are relevant to the life of the student..\nKids in New York come from, and will live in, a different world than\ntheir compatriots in New Mexico. In New Mexico, I was asked whether\nwe could teach casino management and land use. Yes, we could, but\nnot if there is federal accountability about algebra and 20 other subjects\nthat make it impossible to fit these subjects in.\n86 Teaching Minds\nSOME SUBJECTS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHER\nSUBJECTS\nYes, we have electives. But they don’t matter. Because accountability\nmeans making sure that we first teach what does matter. What matters\nis the stuff that we are holding people accountable for. Since this\nseems to be math and science these days, for no good reason I can\ndiscern, this means that we will get to the stuff that would excite kids\nand keep them in school, and might teach them some job skills, after\nwe are done with the important stuff. But I am certain that none of\nthe politicians mentioned in the Times article knows the quadratic\nformula or the elements of the periodic table, which is, of course, the\nstuff of accountability since it is so easy to test. Then how can that be\nthe important stuff?\nALL IMPORTANT SUBJECTS CAN BE EASILY TESTED\nYes, there are right answers in math. But are there right answers in\nwhether we should have invaded Iraq? No? Does that mean we can’t\nteach how governments actually work and how to get reasoned arguments\nto be heard? Is there a right speech political candidates should\nmake? Does that mean we can’t ask students to give speeches because\nwe can’t easily assess them? Do we teach only subjects for which there\nare clear right answers? We do now, which is one reason why school\nis a deadly experience for one and all and will remain so as long as accountability\nis the key word in government.\nSEEING WHO DID BETTER THAN WHOM IN SCHOOL IS AN\nINTRINSIC PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS\nIt really is all about competition, isn’t it? Bush, both Clintons, and\nObama are all the winners of the school competition. They went to\nIvy League schools, which seems to be the real issue for most parents.\nI taught at Ivy League schools and I was profoundly unimpressed\nwith the test- taking, grade-grubbing students I found there. The goal\nof education is not to say who won, and it is not to tell Harvard\nwhom to admit. The goal is provide real-world skills, some of which\nKnowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 87\nmay not be so easy to assess until the graduate actually shows up in\nthe real world.\nALL CHILDREN HAVE THE SAME EDUCATIONAL NEEDS\nThere is more than a 50% dropout rate in many high schools because\nwe have forgotten that not everyone is going to Harvard and that\ngoing to Harvard is not the goal of education. Some children simply\nneed to learn about ethics and business and child raising and how the\nlegal system works, how to take care of their health and how to understand\nwhen politicians are saying things that make no sense. Why\nwouldn’t those subjects be critical? No politician seems to think any\nof those are more important than math and science. How about the\nstudent who has a passion for the environment, or doing social good,\nor being a good parent, or running for office? Does every student’s\nschool life have to be the same?\nSTUDENTS LEARN THAT MEMORIZATION IS MORE IMPORTANT\nTHAN THINKING\nIn an answer-obsessed world, “go figure it out for yourself” or “go try\nit and see what happens” are replaced by more memorization. Giving\nkids a chance to fail helps them learn. Actively preventing failure by\ntelling the right answer just helps kids pass tests. In each of the cognitive\nprocesses that I presented in Chapter 4, failure is not only an\noption—but it will happen all the time. One’s first hypothesis will be\nwrong. One will plan badly or botch a negotiation. These processes are\nall about failure, not right answers. Recovering from failure, getting\nbetter next time, is what learning is all about. Learning entails failure\nand cannot happen without it. The kind of failure I have in mind here\nis expectation failure. This means that we can fail even when we succeed,\nbecause we didn’t expect things to happen quite like they did.\nOur predictions are often wrong. We work at getting better at making\nthem and explaining to ourselves why we were wrong. This process of\nexpectation failure followed by explanation is at the heart of learning.\nThat’s what learning is all about. Memorization has nothing whatever\nto do with learning, unless you want to become a singer.\n88 Teaching Minds\nHow can we offer new curricula and new ways of learning if no matter\nwhat we do children must pass algebra tests? Each administration\nsays over and over again that science is important, but since science\nin high school is defined for the most part by boring tests of vocabulary\nterms and definitions, who would be excited to learn science? If\na really good scientific reasoning curriculum were created, the schools\ncould not offer it unless it helped kids pass the very same tests that\nthat curriculum was intended to replace.\nWe must make radical change. The only way to do that is to stop\nfocusing on teaching subjects and stop using the fact-based tests are\nthe natural end result of that focus on subjects.\nAn education system based on cognitive processes would look\nvery different indeed.\nCHAPTER 8\nNew Curricula for a\nNew Way of Teaching\nA smart man makes a mistake, learns from it, and never\nmakes that mistake again. But a wise man finds a smart man\nand learns from him how to avoid the mistake altogether.\n—Roy H. Williams\nHow do we put all this into practice? First, let’s make sure we avoid\ncreating departments around each of the 12 cognitive processes. The\norganization around subjects, which is the basis of how our schools\nare organized, is the source of the problem in both universities and\nhigh schools.\nSubjects create departments. Departments in universities are a serious\nproblem for students and administrators. They represent silos\nwhere decisions are made that will help the department prosper. Departments\nlobby for their courses to be required so they can hire more\nfaculty. They make sure majors in their departments follow certain\nrules for graduation that are intended to make students scholars in\ntheir field rather than practitioners. Departments are the reason students\ngraduate without job skills. Faculty are almost always against\npractical training. English departments have to be forced to teach students\nto write. Computer science departments have to be forced to\nteach students to program in a way that would make them hirable by\nindustry. Psychology departments avoid teaching clinical psychology,\nwhich is really what students what to learn more about.\nFor about 10 years I have been building new online story-centered\ncurricula. The idea behind a story-centered curriculum (SCC) is that a\ngood curriculum should tell a story. That story should be one in which\nthe student plays one or more roles. Those roles should be those that\nnormally come up in such a story. These curricula are intended to\nteach students how to actually do something. The roles students play\n89\n90 Teaching Minds\nin the story are ones that a graduate of such a program actually might\ndo in real life or actually might need to know about (possibly because\nhe is likely to manage or work with someone who performs that role).\nStories have been at the center of human consciousness for a long\ntime. People tell stories, and the stories they tell shape who they are.\nPeople hear stories and remember those that resonate deeply with\nthem. And, people live stories. The stories they live become part of\nthem in a deep way. While we may easily forget everything about a\ntraditional course we took in high school, we can hardly forget the\nroles we have played in real-life experiences, especially when those\nroles went on for a long time and had emotional impact on us.\nThe central argument here is that good education requires good\nstories—not solely stories that one is told, however. A good education\nrelies on the creation of stories that a student can participate in and\nfeel deeply about. This means that those stories must include others\nwho are playing roles the student will have to deal with on the job,\nand that the roles the student plays in the stories must relate to the\ncurrent or future roles that the student intends to play in his or her\ncareer.\nThe SCC is inherently goal-based. The goals must be those that a\nstudent has already. For small boys, for example, it can be assumed\nthat the idea of building a truck or designing an airplane is an activity\nthat would grab their interest. For older students, these would be\nones like current or future job assignments. In an online world, it is\nquite possible to create hundreds or thousands of choices and allow\nstudents to pick what they want to do—not what they want to study,\nbut activities that genuinely excite them.\nThe SCC is inherently activity-based. The tasks that constitute the\nSCC must relate to goals that the student has and the tasks that people\nactually perform in the roles that the student will play when the training\nis completed. Thus, an SCC is made up of a set of real-life types of\ntasks that make up the bulk of the work done by the student, and a set\nof events that occasionally interrupt or augment those tasks.\nThanks to a grant from the Kauffman Foundation, we built a fullyear\n(all day, every day) high school curriculum in health sciences.\nThis would be, ideally, used in a high school that offered perhaps over\n100 full-year curricula. Students would choose four that they liked and\nafter completing them would graduate from high school. All of the\ncurricula would teach what it is like to live in a part of the real world,\nas well as allowing for practice in the 12 cognitive processes. It takes\nNew Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 91\na while to build these SCCs and they are quite expensive to build, but\nthey cost less than building a new school, so the money could easily\nbe made available.\nLet’s look at the health sciences curriculum we built.\nThe year in health sciences comprises nine “rotations,” each lasting\n3 to 4 full-time weeks on average, in which students experience\nwhat it is like to solve the kinds of problems real professionals solve\nin various specialized fields related to biology and healthcare. These\nexperiences are set in realistic stories in which the students play a\nleading role. The rotations are conducted consecutively. Students primarily\nwork on assigned projects in teams, although each rotation has\nindependent tasks as well. Each of the rotations was created with the\nassistance of an expert in each of the respective specialties.\nOne goal of the curriculum is for students to discover that practicing\nscience is fun and relevant to real-world problems. They also\nshould develop a sense of what it would be like to work as a practitioner\nin the various health sciences fields, so they can decide whether\nthey might someday like a career in healthcare or biology. Of course,\nthe real goal is to enable practice in the 12 cognitive processes. Let’s\nsee how that happens.\nThe rotations in the year in health sciences are:\n1. Internal Medicine—Students diagnose and develop a treatment\nplan for a fictional patient who has a major illness and\nultimately requires an organ transplant as a part of his\ntreatment. Students also make judgments about ethical issues\nrelated to transplants, following a principled approach to\nethical reasoning.\n2. Nutrition Advisor—Students coach fictional nutritional\nadvisors on their management of teenage clients’ nutritional\nconcerns and issues. During the process they also develop\nnutritional plans for themselves and for a peer.\n3. Super Worm—Students work for a fictional philanthropic\nbillionaire who asks them to invent ways of modifying the\ncommon earthworm so it can more efficiently improve soil to\nbetter supply the world with food.\n4. Sports Medic—Students diagnose and develop treatment plans\nfor patients who have sports-related injuries. In the process\nstudents produce in-depth reports on additional issues related\nto sports medicine.\n92 Teaching Minds\n5. Designer Genes—Students consider ethical and political issues\nrelated to genetic engineering, for example, cloning, gene\ntherapies, and the manufacturing of drugs. In the process\nthey learn about DNA and the basics of genetic engineering.\n6. Plant Plague—Students working for a fictional county farming\nagency are faced with an anomalous powdery mildew that\nhas infected wheat in their local area. They investigate how\nthe new strain of mildew arose and how it spread to this area\nand crop in particular. They work to develop a treatment for\nthe current crop; then they develop a way to alter the wheat\nor the way in which it is grown to prevent future fungal\noutbreaks.\n7. Medical Detective—Students work with the fictional county\nmedical examiner to conduct medical investigations. They\nare asked to determine the time and cause of death for\nvarious mysterious cases.\n8. Cutting Costs Without Cutting Care—In this rotation,\nstudents consider business aspects related to healthcare.\nStudents play the role of a hospital consultant whose job\nit is to discern why the hospital is losing money and make\nrecommendations for correcting the situation. In the process\nthey confront ethical issues related to cutting costs in the\narea of healthcare.\n9. Outbreak—In this rotation, students work in the areas\nof infectious disease, epidemiology, and public health\nadministration. They begin by diagnosing the cause of a\nfictional patient’s infection that stems from bacteria in a\nfood item. They then learn that many people across the\ncountry have been found with similar illnesses. Students\nhave to develop a plan to manage the outbreak due to the\navailability of the food item to a wide population. Later they\nare fictionally hired to develop a readiness plan for a possible\nworldwide pandemic.\nStudents spend weeks in each rotation. What do they learn?\nRemember, the answer cannot be that they learn about health sciences.\nWhy not?\nBecause that is really not the issue. No high school student learning\na subject really learns that subject. Students forget what they have\nNew Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 93\nlearned in a day or in a week or a year. Professors always assume that\nentering high school students need to be retaught the basics. They\nmay pick up the general idea but in reality the content of the subject\narea is, at best, vaguely understood. What they can learn is that they\nlike a subject or have an interest in learning more.\nThe only other thing they can learn involves the 12 cognitive processes.\nSo let’s look at how the health sciences curriculum covers these\nprocesses.\nBy explicit design, all of the health science rotations emphasize all\nfour of the “social processes.” The students work in teams (teamwork),\nsometimes even in collaboration with other teams. The students and\nteams necessarily try to influence one another, negotiate with one another,\nand constantly have to describe their points of view and their\nresults. The step-by-step instructions that are part of every rotation\nexplicitly discuss how best to handle this. Now let’s look at four of the\nrotations in detail.\nINTERNAL MEDICINE\nThe essence of this rotation is learning about how to do diagnosis,\nin this case, of liver disease. Students watch a detailed interview with\nthe patient, select (after some orientation) specific tests to administer,\nreceive the results, and report suggested diagnoses. They must communicate\nwhat they have discovered. So they describe the patient’s\nsymptoms and must analyze and discuss the causation of the patient’s\nsymptoms. Then they begin to plan a course of action. Planning what\nto do is a major component of this rotation. To do this they must\nmake a judgment as a crucial part of the diagnostic work. They must\ndo this again as well in the ethics unit that occurs later in this rotation.\nIn that unit they undertake a detailed study of both medical and ethical\nissues in liver transplantation—which is where evaluation comes\ninto play. Here the students become consciously aware of their values\nas they decide how to influence medical and ethical choices.\nSUPER WORM\nThe students plan carefully for this unit (a hypothetical redesign of the\nearthworm to make it even more helpful in agriculture). Hypothetical\n94 Teaching Minds\nexperimentation is performed repeatedly as the students predict the\neffects of various modifications of the worm’s anatomy. Describing\ntheir conclusions is important—the project’s goals; the worm’s anatomy,\nphysiology, and behavior; and the interaction of anatomy and\nfunction.\nSPORTS MEDIC\nThe core of this rotation is four athletic injuries. In each case the students\nexamine the patients, describe their observations in detail, and\nperform a formal differential diagnosis. The students must use judgment\nand modeling to predict the effect of providing a competitive\nathlete with an artificial bone implant.\nDESIGNER GENES\nThis rotation has three primary activities. In all three, evaluation plays\na role as they discuss genetically modified animals, crops, and muscles.\nDescribing, planning, and influence all are involved as the students\nprepare a congressman for hearings. All four of the social processes\ncome into play in formal debates.\nWhat should be clear here is that what the health sciences curriculum\nseems to be about and what it is actually about are very different\nthings. It seems to be about teaching health sciences content, when\nwhat it is really about is having students practice various cognitive\nprocesses that occur again and again throughout life. This was the goal\nof the design, pure and simple: to help students practice thinking. It\nreally doesn’t matter what arena they are thinking in. We get them\ninterested in thinking by having them think about something that\ninterests them and is connected to a world they may wish to explore\nlater on in life. They may indeed learn something about that world as\nwell, but the point is the cognitive process-based education, not the\nsubject-based education.\nI thought of the idea of building SCCs instead of using the normal\nset of courses that constitute most students’ school year when I took\na job with Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as the Chief Education\nOfficer of its new West Coast campus, located in Silicon Valley. There\nNew Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 95\nwere no faculty located at this campus, since Carnegie Mellon is in\nPittsburgh. I took this as an opportunity, not as a problem, since faculty\nwant to teach the way they always have taught. Lecturing is easy\nand faculty like to do it. Students have learned to cope with lecturing\nand later cramming for tests, so no one complains much. No one\nlearns much from this, but no one seems to be too concerned about it.\nI was asked to design master’s degree programs in computer science.\nIt seemed to me that students entered a master’s degree program\nbecause they wanted to get a good job after graduation, so I asked\nwhat jobs they were preparing for as I looked at each Pittsburgh campus\nprogram. Even though the faculty in Pittsburgh had been teaching\nthese master’s degree programs for years, faculty members were\nsurprisingly unconcerned with what students did after graduation.\nThey just taught their courses, their specialties actually, and assumed\nthe students would find value in them. This seemed an odd state of\naffairs to anyone who looked at it from the outside, but as professor I\nknow that faculty are rarely concerned with master’s degree students\nat all and naturally wouldn’t have given these programs that much\nthought.\nThere was a great deal of hostility to the SCCs that were built by\nmy team and me. They were seen as threatening the existing structure\nof courses and lectures. Nevertheless, the students liked them a great\ndeal and the people who mentored in them, after some initial resistance,\nbegan to like them and promote them. This happened in the\nareas of software engineering and software development.\nThe faculty in e-business liked what we had built so much that\nthey got rid of the existing course-based, e-business master’s degree\nthey had offered in Pittsburgh and now offer only the SCC version on\nthe main CMU campus.\nSCCs work and work well. Students learn actual skills and teachers\nfeel like they are helping students do something real. But faculty,\nwho are used to the old classroom-style method, often resist doing the\nhard work now required of them. This is true for students as well. One\nmentor in the West Coast e-business program who himself had graduated\nfrom the Pittsburgh classroom-based program said that he felt\nsorry for the kids on the West Coast campus because they had to work\nso hard. He noted that they were learning a lot more than he did but\nthat he had liked sitting in the back of the classroom and ignoring the\nteacher. It was much easier and he had done well at that.\n96 Teaching Minds\nA story-centered curriculum is intended to teach cognitive processes,\nnot subjects. Subjects are, of course, covered, but they are not\nreally the point. Certain things need to be done again and again in\nlife, but those things can be learned only in context, not as an abstraction.\nDifferent contexts must be provided in order to motivate\nstudents and to provide real-world skills that will be remembered, not\nbecause they were studied and tested, but because they were practiced\nagain and again.\nWhat is life like in a story-centered curriculum? The first ones we\nbuilt were built as master’s degree programs at Carnegie Mellon’s new\nWest Coast campus. Here is Max Soderby, a mentor in the first one of\nthose master’s programs, talking about his experience:\nI am almost jealous in a way because I see that they are gaining\nskills more rapidly than I gained them when I was a student in\nPittsburgh at CMU’s campus. They get exposure to things that\nwe just talked about in a lecture hall, whereas they are actually\ndoing it: implementing actual software and putting designs\ninto practice. We mostly did homework and talked about it in a\nlecture hall. So I am jealous in that respect. It is also a lot more\nwork, but that work pays off for the students.\nSubject-based education is not really supposed to be training for work.\nI once proposed to the president of Yale (Bart Giamatti) that we build\na master’s degree program in an area of computer science that would\nhelp get people jobs after graduation. He said that that was training\nand that Yale does not do training. The academic subjects taught at\nYale are meant to produce scholars. But, in a way, he was very wrong.\nYale does do training. Yale and almost all other colleges are divided\ninto departments, and a major in a department’s subject typically\nis seen by the faculty as preparation for an academic career in that\nsubject.\nThe students may well have a different point of view, however.\nUnfortunately, they come away disappointed. An English major could\nbe hoping to become a journalist, but the education that he will receive\nis more likely to be appropriate for creating an English professor.\nA math major may well want to be an actuary, but will not learn\nactuarial science at Yale. He will learn to be a potential mathematics\nprofessor. And, worst of all, in my own field of computer science, the\nNew Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 97\nvery idea that a Yale degree would make you capable of getting a good\njob as a programmer is frowned upon by the faculty. They are training\ncomputer science professors. This is the logical end result of subjectbased\ntraining.\nNow, what Giamatti had in mind as the end goal of college,\ntraining for the mind, is a noble enough ideal, and a natural outcome\nof cognitive process-based education. The classic liberal arts\nview of education, one that a reader might think I am not in favor\nof, is actually a better model than the model that has evolved in the\nnation’s top universities. The idea that you should try thinking in\na variety of fields is a better plan, and one more in line with what I\nam proposing here, than the model that exists on most universities’\ncampuses. The latter model, the one that makes students major in a\nsubject and thus supposedly become prepared to work in that field,\nis really just a big lie.\nThere is nothing unusual here. Here again, is a statement from the\nIvy League professor whom I quoted earlier:\nThere is an unspoken rule at places like my university that if you\nare really good, you do exactly what your teacher does.\nSo what are these schools training students for? It could be only one\nthing—to become professors. There is no attempt to teach practical\nreal-world applications of the ideas taught in classes, in part because\nthe faculty themselves don’t know those applications. Here is the Big\nTen computer science professor again:\nThere are roughly 60 faculty members in computer science. They\ncover all the traditional areas of computer science. Ironically,\nsoftware engineering, which is what 90% of the undergraduates\ndo when they graduate, is not covered. It is not considered an\nintellectual or academic discipline. It is considered too practical.\nThere is only one software engineering course and it is taught by\nan adjunct because no one really cares about it.\nThis is a real problem because (the Big Ten professor again). . .\nThere are hundreds of computer science majors here. The\nfaculty doesn’t feel it needs to change because there are students\n98 Teaching Minds\nclamoring for what is now offered. Ninety-eight percent of them\nwant to be programmers. Almost none of them want Ph.D.s.\nI cannot go to a faculty meeting any more. I get into a fight\nat every faculty meeting. I argue about teaching and education\nand they think they know because they are professors. I cannot\nsubject myself anymore to their abuse.\nThese problems exist precisely because of the subject-based\neducation system. That system is about factual knowledge, and it is\nthis emphasis on factual knowledge that has given rise to the testing\nmania that has swept the country. These problems exist because the\nreal mission of the university is very different than the general public\nimagines.\nHere is a quote and a story that I rather like:\nA university is what a college becomes when the faculty loses\ninterest in students.—John Ciardi\nBenjamin Franklin told the story of some Massachusetts\ncommissioners who invited the Indians to send a dozen of their\nyouth to study free at Harvard. The Indians replied that they\nhad sent some of their young braves to study there years earlier,\nbut on their return “they were absolutely good for nothing,\nbeing neither acquainted with the true methods for killing deer,\ncatching beaver, or surprising an enemy.” They offered instead to\neducate a dozen or so white children in the ways of the Indians\n“and make men of them.”(From Benjamin Franklin, An American\nLife, by Walter Isaacson)\nWhat has changed? Key life skills no longer include catching beaver.\nOtherwise, things are pretty much the same. Change “catching beaver”\nto any modern daily skill, and Franklin’s story is just as valid\ntoday.\nWhat do students really learn at a great university? Parents never\nreally ask this question. They just know that their kid got into a good\ncollege and that their child is lucky to go there.\nShould you avoid sending your child to top schools because they\ndon’t teach so well there and really don’t plan to improve the situation\nany time soon?\nNew Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 99\nNo. Of course not. If your child gets into Yale, send her there. It is\na great place. But you should know what Yale actually has to offer and\nwhat it doesn’t.\nIf your child wants to be a professor, Yale is the place.\nIf your child wants to be an intellectual, Yale is the place.\nIf your child wants to go to law school, Yale is the place.\nIf your child wants to hobnob with the best and brightest, Yale is\nthe place.\nIf your child wants to have a fun time for 4 years, Yale is the\nplace.\nThen what is wrong?\nThere is a problem only if you think that there is a different reason\nto go to college than the reasons I have listed above.\nOh. There is this other problem. Many of the other 3,000 colleges\nare trying very hard to imitate Yale. They attempt to provide similar\nexperiences and they can’t pull it off. Yale is a unique place. The nation\ncan afford only so many unique places, however. We cannot afford\nhaving the main university of a state thinking it is Yale, as my\nstate university friend suggests. If every university has as its main focus\nresearch and not education, then the best and brightest of each\nstate will be trained, not necessarily willingly, to be academics rather\nthan practitioners. There will be a great many students who came to\nschool for an education that will help them in their future lives who\nwill be disappointed to find out that that is not the type of education\nbeing offered.\nProfessors at Yale are playing the prestige game. Unfortunately,\nthey are hardly alone in this.\nMy state university professor again:\nWe definitely want to be part of the superstar system but we have\nno superstars. If we had them, we would probably lose them to\nHarvard and Yale anyway. Nevertheless, we are obsessed with\nthe National Rankings put out by places like U.S. News and World\nReport. Faculty and deans say they are not obsessed with them,\nbut rankings are an important part of the evaluation process and\nshape a department’s growth. We want to be in the top 4 or 5\nuniversities. We are not but that’s what we want to be.\n100 Teaching Minds\nU.S. News and World Report’s annual rankings weigh heavily on the\nminds of the faculty and administration of universities who are in\nthe prestige game. These rankings are based on numbers: average SAT\nscores of admitted students, average rank in class of admitted students,\nfaculty publications, and many other numbers that come out in favor\nof research universities with world-class faculty. But world-class faculty\nmeans faculty who care about research and not about teaching.\nWhile there certainly is no harm in going to Harvard or Yale, the success\nof their students hardly depends on what they learned in those\nplaces and depends a great deal more on the fact that the best and the\nbrightest are the ones who go there in the first place.\nThese places get away with teaching courses in obscure issues in\nliterature and history, or in economic theory or in complex mathematics,\nby pretending that they are really teaching students to think.\nBut does knowing obscure information necessarily imply that one is\na good thinker?\nA good thinker, I claim, would be good at each of the 12 cognitive\nprocesses.\nWhat does it mean to be good at prediction, for example? Is a\n2-year-old good at prediction? Is a dog good at prediction? Is a professional\ngambler good at prediction? Is a stock trader good at prediction?\nIs a mother of a toddler good at prediction? Is a politician good\nat prediction? Is a scientist good at prediction?\nWe actually are quite good at assessing the ability of others at prediction\nprecisely because we have data to support our conclusions. We\nknow how good gamblers or stock traders are at predicting. If they are\nvery successful, we can say they are brilliant at what they do, or we can\nsay they are lucky. Those are our choices.\nThe same is true of scientists. Most scientists make predictions,\nand those that are proven right are seen as brilliant. Luck enters into\nscience as well and quite often scientists say that a given Nobel Prize\nwinner was lucky and isn’t really all that bright.\nDogs are seen as being smart (for a dog) when they can correctly\npredict the arrival of their master or bad weather or threats, and are\nseen as stupid when they bark at thunder. Their behavior is seen as\nstupid precisely because of the erroneous prediction that barking will\nscare the thunder away. A dog’s inability to predict is exactly why we\nthink dogs are dumb animals, and when they surprise us with an accurate\nprediction, they are seen as smart. Of course, we don’t expect\ndogs to predict who will win the big game. We know their limitations.\nNew Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 101\nBut it is not only the accuracy of predictions that factors into our\nsense of a person’s or an animal’s ability to think. We say that a person\nis intelligent even when he predicts badly, if he gives good explanations\nfor his predictions even though they don’t pan out.\nSo when a sportscaster gives his prediction about the outcome of\nan upcoming game, we think he is intelligent if he has thought it out\ncarefully, and if his explanation is coherent, and if his reasoning is\nsound, and we give extra credit if some of his ideas are surprising in\nsome way. So, even if he subsequently turns out to be wrong, we still\nthink he is good at thinking.\nBut prediction is actually quite complicated to judge. We respect\ngreat predictors. We think people who can predict well, especially\nthose who can explain their predictions well, are very intelligent. But,\noften, we see intelligence when it may not be there. The reason is\nscripts. And we may fail to see it when it is there. The reason for that\nis explanations.\nScripts and explanations are at the beginning and at the end of\nintelligent behavior. What do I mean by that?\nWhen a child is learning about the world, she is learning the\nscripts that commonly are followed in the world that she inhabits.\nI have explained this at length in two different books, 1 so I will just\nsummarize here.\nScripts tell us what will happen next in the aspects of the world\nthat repeat frequently. Anyone who goes to a restaurant knows that\nwhen you order food, someone will bring it to you and later you will\nbe expected to pay for it. There are lots of variations on this standard\nrestaurant script, however. It doesn’t work quite like that at Burger\nKing. The script is different but there is a script there too and we learn\nit if we frequent Burger King. The restaurant script has many variations\nand we are initially confused when we encounter a new one, but\nwe learn through repeated practice. And, we generalize so that we can\nunderstand that the McDonald’s script is pretty much the same as the\none at Burger King.\nWe can predict what will happen next in the world based on experiences\nwe have repeated. Following scripts is so normal that it is\nnot seen as a sign of intelligence to be able to do it. We don’t exclaim:\nWow, he predicted that the waitress would bring what we ordered and\nshe did. Amazing!\nBut the opposite is certainly seen as a sign of stupidity. Once one\nhas experienced something many times, one should know what will\n102 Teaching Minds\nhappen next in that arena. Dogs usually know the scripts that pertain\nto them, as well. They know which merchant will have the dog biscuit\nfor them, for example.\nPeople seem astonishingly dumb when they can’t predict what\nis obvious to everyone else. Not knowing what will happen next in\na script you don’t know, because you don’t have the relevant experience,\nmeans nothing at all, of course. The question is: If you have\nexperienced something repeatedly, why haven’t you figured out that\nwhat you have seen before will happen again?\nScript following is, therefore, a sign of intelligence but a very limited\none. We can blindly follow a script, and this can make us seem\ndumb indeed. Since scripts vary one from the other in many ways,\nthe ability to see the nuances makes all the difference. Expecting that\na fast-food restaurant will be the same as a three-star Michelin restaurant\nbecause it is a restaurant after all is what makes people seem\nstupid. Failing to make the right generalizations indicates a lack of\nthought.\nThe real question is this: What do you do when your script fails?\nThis is important because scripts fail all the time. You expect something\nto happen and it doesn’t. You love the cheesecake at Lindy’s and\nsuddenly it doesn’t serve cheesecake. Or you find that Lindy’s is now\nout of business. What do you do? People recover from script failure on\na daily basis. How they do this tells us a lot about how the mind works.\nWhen people refuse to abandon the generalizations they have\nmade, they immediately are perceived as being stupid. When a medical\nassistant asked me the other day about the upcoming Thanksgiving\nholiday, I responded that I would be eating duck instead of turkey.\nShe said that sounded awful and that duck was greasy and gamey and\nit sounded like a terrible idea. I asked her if she had ever eaten duck\nand she said no because it was game and she hated game. I told her it\nwasn’t gamey. She refused to believe me. I was about to recommend\ntrying magret de canard but thought better of it and asked if she had\never eaten in a French restaurant in her life. She said that she hadn’t.\nPeople who have scripts often generalize them so that in their own\nminds they experts on things that they have never experienced. This\nis what stupid looks like.\nOn the other hand, we might wonder what smart looks like. Let’s\nimagine the same woman with the same beliefs hearing me say that\nduck was not gamey or greasy. Intelligent people respond, when they\nNew Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 103\nare confused, or when a long-held belief is challenged, with a request\nfor evidence. She might have asked where she might try duck or what\nduck tasted like since she had not understood it correctly. She might\nhave allowed for the possibility that she was wrong and asked to know\nmore. But she didn’t. People who aren’t intellectually curious rarely do.\nThis kind of dull thinking is not so much a matter of genetics as it\na matter of not having been educated properly. And, that is, of course,\nthe real issue here. If a child grows up in a world where questions are\nexpected and where long-held beliefs can be abandoned because of\nnew evidence, he will seek such interactions. But a child who grows up\nin a world where adults set themselves up as knowing everything and\nno one’s beliefs are ever questioned, you will get mindless behavior\nlike this.\nOf course, it doesn’t matter if this woman doesn’t try duck. It\nis likely, however, that this behavior pattern—learn rules and never\nquestion them—pervades her life. This leads me to my main point.\nScripts are great things to have. They get you through the airport.\nThey get you through Burger King. They get you through most of the\nmundane aspects of life. But scripts need to be modified. They fail all\nthe time. The airport starts a new check-in procedure. The restaurant\nyou always go to deletes your favorite item from the menu. The store\nyou always shop in is getting very crowded. At some point we encounter\nscript failure and we deal with it. The question is how.\nWe deal with script failure using two key procedures. It is our facility\nwith these procedures that differentiates intelligence from stupidity.\nThinking depends on them, and everyone must do them when\ntrying to think. But not everyone does them well.\nThe procedures are:\nGeneralization\nExplanation\nThese are not new ideas in the context of this book. Explanation is\none kind of describing. Generalization is the method by which we do\nprediction, make judgments, do diagnosis, and determine causation.\nWe generalize whenever we try to think.\nThis entire book is a generalization. It is an attempt to make\nsense of a vast array of information. That is what generalization is all\nabout. The book is also an explanation of the generalizations I have\n104 Teaching Minds\nfound to be true. At the core of thinking, you find generalization and\nexplanation. But it is important to remember that what starts the\nprocess of generalization and explanation is failure. Without failure\nwe don’t try to generalize and explain because we have nothing to\ngeneralize and explain. Thinking, therefore, looks like this:\nMake a prediction\nPrediction fails\nMake a generalization\nExplain your generalization\nMake a new prediction\nLet me explain how this works and why one cannot think well if one\ncannot do this. To explain, I will tell a personal story relating to my\nown thinking and learning with respect to two of the twelve cognitive\nprocesses. I will explain afterwards why I have chosen to tell stories\nand why I have used personal ones.\nDESCRIBING\nLet’s start with describing. There is, of course, an art to describing.\nAnyone who writes and anyone who speaks publicly is learning all the\ntime about describing. Since I was a professor for 30 odd years, and\nsince I have written hundreds of papers and about 25 books, and since\nI have given numerous keynote speeches around the world, I have\nbeen thinking a great deal about describing for many years. I learn\nsomething whenever I speak publicly because I can easily tell whether\nI am being heard or not. Are the listeners on the edge of their seats or\nare they half asleep (or literally asleep)? I learn when I write because I\nread the reviews, and colleagues are always happy to tell me what was\nwrong with what I wrote.\nOnce, I was given a lesson in public speaking by someone older\nand wiser than me that I never forgot. I recently had been hired at\nStanford as a professor. I was pretty young (22) and full of myself. In\nthose days, the Computer Science Department ran a course for new\ngraduate students that served as an introduction to all the special research\npossibilities in artificial intelligence for those who wanted to\nenter that field. There were many faculty in AI at Stanford and each\nNew Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 105\ngot a week to talk about what his work was about. The goal was to try\nto convince students to sign up for a special research seminar with\nthat faculty member the following quarter.\nMy champion at Stanford was a psychiatrist named Kenneth Colby.\nHe invited me to share his week and thus we would be a team for\nwhich students could sign up the following quarter. I listened to his\ntalks to the students. He was very funny but rather light on content, in\nmy opinion. I wasn’t impressed. But, after I spoke, he said something\nto me I never forgot. He said: If you try to say everything that you\nknow in an hour, either of two things is true. Either you can do it and\ntherefore you must not know very much, or else you can’t do it and\nyou will talk way too fast trying to fit it all in and you will be generally\nincomprehensible.\nI listened to what he had to say, but I wasn’t sure he was right. At\nthe first meeting of our jointly run seminar, we discovered that we\nhad won the student jackpot. While other faculty had gotten four or\nfive sign-ups, we had gotten 25. I was very proud of myself until the\nstudents went around the table to say who they were and why they\nhad signed up. Not a single one of them had signed up because of anything\nI had said. They had been mesmerized by Colby.\nThen I reheard in my head what Colby had told me the previous\nquarter. He had entertained them—not overwhelmed them. They\nthought he would be interesting and fun and they wanted to work\nwith him. While I had looked down on his lighthearted presentation\nstyle, it turned out he knew what he was doing.\nSo, what did I learn and how did my thinking change? Thinking,\nas I said earlier, looks like this:\nMake a prediction\nPrediction fails\nMake a generalization\nExplain your generalization\nMake a new prediction\nWhat was my prediction? I had predicted that speaking quickly with\na great deal of brilliant content would woo the incoming students.\nThis was simply wrong. I needed to make a new generalization. Fortunately,\nI did not have to do the work myself. Colby had helped me by\nsupplying a generalization that he believed to be true. (Good teachers\n106 Teaching Minds\ndo exactly this: They supply generalizations when a student needs one\nand cannot come up with one by himself after a prediction that he\nmade has failed.)\nThe generalization that Colby supplied was, more or less: Be entertaining\nif you want to attract followers and be listened to.\nWas he right? Is this a good generalization?\nThe next step in thinking is: Explain your generalization. What\nthis means here is that I needed to understand why this might be\ntrue. If possible, one wants to test out the new hypothesis. Fortunately\nfor me, I had many opportunities to speak in public over the next 40\nyears. I tried many different methods of teaching and lecturing. Entertaining\nalways works. Colby was right.\nBut I said that one needs to explain why it works. This is my explanation:\nPeople have trouble paying attention to someone who talks for\nan hour. Human beings are not built for this. Our ancestors certainly\ndidn’t listen to lectures. People communicate best by asking questions\nand interrupting. Since this isn’t possible in a lecture, any questions\nthey might ask, they ask themselves and try to answer. While they are\nthinking about what a speaker says, the speaker keeps on talking. No\none can really hear a lecture, in my opinion. So, a good speaker, recognizing\nthis, does not try to make the audience do that. He makes them\nlaugh, he paints interesting pictures for them to ponder, he amazes\nthem perhaps, but he does not try to get them to, nor does he expect\nthem to, remember all that he has said. The less content, the more\nlikely they will remember. Colby knew all this. I learned it over time.\nHe jump-started my thinking.\nBy now, this new generalization of mine, together with my explanation,\nis part of my core beliefs. But any belief can be challenged by\nreality. And, any new belief generates new predictions. So I predicted\nthat if I was funnier when I spoke, people would appreciate what I\nsaid more. I also predicted that if I didn’t speak much in a graduate\nseminar and let students argue with one another, they would get more\nout of it. After 40 years I still believe these things. But, and this is the\nimportant part, there are nuances upon nuances about all these issues\nin my memory. I need to explain it simply when I write or speak\nabout it, but when I think about it, I recall all kinds of exceptions and\ncaveats. I know, or at least I think I know, a great deal about speaking\nand have lots of memories about specific successes and failures.\nThinking and learning require one to recall one’s experiences, analyze\nthose experiences, come up with new hypotheses about failures, make\nNew Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 107\nnew predictions, and be prepared for these predictions to fail. This is\nwhat thinking looks like no matter which cognitive process is being\nthought about and practiced.\nDIAGNOSIS\nNow let’s talk about diagnosis. Again I will start with a story. This is\none I have been telling for a long time because it informs us about\nhow the mind works.\nI was discussing with my colleague (Bob Abelson) how it could\nbe that my wife could not seem to make steak rare (as I like it—she is\nno longer my wife, but not because of this). Bob responded that he\ncouldn’t get his hair cut as short as he wanted in England 20 years\nearlier.\nThis seems on the surface to be a rather odd response, but when\nwe look deeper we can see that I was saying something like, She could\ndo this right if she wanted to, and he was thinking, Maybe she thinks\nthe request is too extreme, as happened to me with a barber in England\nmany years ago.\nMatching odd situations to other odd situations and seeing the\nsimilarity is what creative thinking is all about. Bob was trying to diagnose\na problem that had been on his mind for a long time, and my\nnew story provided him with new evidence to think again about what\nthe proper diagnosis might be. This is what thinking looks like. It is\nalso what reminding looks like. People get reminded precisely because\nthey are trying to match a new situation to one they already know\nabout and thereby determine what to do next. To put this another\nway, diagnosis depends on prior diagnosis. We constantly are trying\nto improve our diagnostic capability because we always strive to make\nbetter decisions no matter what arena these decisions are in. The fact\nthat the improvement of diagnostic capability is not explicitly part of\neach and every curriculum in school is scandalous.\nWhen we design new curricula, we need to ground them in some\nrealistic framework that will enable students to practice things that\nthey might end up doing in the real world. But that does not mean\nthat the real issue in designing these curricula is anything other than\nteaching thinking, that is, enabling practice in the 12 cognitive processes.\nHowever, teaching thinking in the absence of a context that\ntruly interests students is absurd.\n\nCHAPTER 9\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive\nProcesses That Underlie Learning\nThe art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery.\n—Mark Van Doren\nWe need to completely redefine what we mean by school and what we\ndo in school. We need to think about education in a new way. Rather\nthan wanting people to be educated, which usually means being able\nto quote Shakespeare or nod sagely when Freud’s name is mentioned,\nwe need to expect people to be able to think well. Education would be\nbetter defined by defining an educated person as one who can make\nwell-reasoned arguments for what they are about to do.\nWe must focus on teaching cognitive processes and abandoning\nthe subject-based (and test-based) education system we have now that\nis clearly failing. The reason we have all those tests is simply because\nwe have no idea how to make people learn all the stuff that is part of\nthat subject-based system without threatening them. No one really\nwants to learn the Pythagorean theorem or information about the Taft\nHartley Act. Let scholars know about these things; the average person\njust doesn’t need to know this stuff.\nBut all people do know how to find and use the mathematics they\nneed when they have continually practiced it, and they know how to\nfind prior relevant experiences when they have to come up with a new\nplan they want to propose. That simply does not mean we have to tell\nit all to them years before they might ever make use of it.\nIn the age of the Internet, just-in-time learning is a serious reality.\nWe can change things now in part because we have information readily\navailable online. But the Internet has been designed by committee.\nIt has much in it that is nonsense, and finding what you need just in\ntime can be quite difficult. Still, it would not be that complicated to design\na different kind of Internet, the moral equivalent of Encyclopedia\n109\n110 Teaching Minds\nBritannica, if you will. It would be filled with knowledge from experts\nthat had been vetted by other experts and delivered seamlessly without\nyour having to search for it. You don’t need to be a scholar in order\nto make reasoned decisions. You just need to know how to find information\nto help you think things out well. This means that learning\nto think clearly and knowing how to assess the value of new evidence\nthat one has found, must be the main goal of any school system.\nWhen does school start to falter? One way to think about school\nis to ask about the significance and age-related properties of each of\nthe cognitive processes. Let’s see if we can rank the processes in terms\nof age. Which of these processes would we expect a child who was\nentering school to already be able to do? To put this another way, a\nnormal 5-year-old:\n1. can make some accurate predictions about very simple\nthings, like where his mother might be and what she might\nbe doing and what will be on television\n2. would have trouble modeling any process\n3. has a limited sense of evaluation but knows what he likes\n4. would be able to experiment with simple things like food and\ntoys\n5. might be able to do limited diagnosis of what might have\ngone wrong in a process, but it typically would be limited to\nexplanations that he had heard from someone else\n6. might be able to do limited planning based on plans that had\nbeen used before\n7. might know something about causation because he would\nhave been told about it and remembered what he had been\ntold\n8. can make some judgments based on his own tastes and what\nhe has been taught about what is good and what is bad\n9. can do some describing, but typically is not at all good at it\n10. should be able to influence some people, especially his\ngrandparents\n11. should be able to work in a simple team together with kids\nhis own age toward a goal\n12. should be able to do some simple negotiation, especially with\nhis parents, siblings, and some friends\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 111\nSo, upon reaching school age, a child can do some of the cognitive\nprocesses. Now the question is, How to we teach him to get better at\nthem?\nFirst let’s see what the cognitive processes fundamentally have in\ncommon. This will give us a way of thinking about how to teach them.\nThe first and most important thing they have in common is that\nthey all rely on a case base. We have all engaged in each of these\nprocesses many times and we have a range of experiences we can call\nupon to guide us the next time we find ourselves doing them. Each\nprocess relies on a story base as well. We can tell stories about interesting\nexperiences we have had in doing each one of them. Stories\nusually revolve around failures, or at least unexpected results, since\nwithout these there are no good stories to tell. Engaging in any cognitive\nprocess includes the possibility of making a mistake during the\nprocess. We expect to get smarter each time as a result of any mistakes\nwe make. This is what cognitive processes are like. We learn cognitive\nprocesses through experience and we index the failures we have so\nthat we can find them again and perhaps avoid making the same mistake.\nWhen we avoid an error that we know we have made previously,\nwe say that we have learned.\nIt follows, therefore, that acquiring a case base, learning the stories\nof others and learning to tell our own stories, and learning classic\nmistakes and being able to analyze behavior to find a mistake are all\naspects of learning the cognitive processes.\nAcquiring the case base and consciously analyzing the cases in\nthat case base, then, is the fundamental issue in teaching the cognitive\nprocesses.\nHOW TO TEACH PREDICTION\nWe live in a physical world but we also live in a social world. Children\nneed to understand that if they drop something heavy on their foot,\nit will hurt; they also need to know that if they do something mean\nto someone, the person may dislike them for it and may seek revenge.\nWe use predictions to figure out what will happen as a result of our\nactions and then we use that knowledge to guide us in our future\n112 Teaching Minds\nactions. What kinds of predictions do children regularly make, then?\nAnd, what can we teach and how can they learn?\n1. Children predict the actions of the people that they interact\nwith, but they do not necessarily realize that they do this.\n2. Children predict the reactions of objects and actions in the\nphysical world, but they do not necessarily realize that they\ndo this either.\n3. Children predict their own feelings and mental states. They\ndo things that they think will make them happy, but they\ndon’t necessarily realize that they do this either.\nThese three worlds, the social, the physical, and the mental, are at the\ncenter of what adults make predictions about. We predict the speed\nof an oncoming car and decide whether we can cross the street safely.\nChildren may not do this so well. We predict what will happen when\nwe scream and yell at someone, but children may not predict this too\nwell either. We predict events that will make us happy or sad, such as\ntaking a nice vacation, or playing a game, or a good meal, or establishing\na relationship with another person. Children do not consciously\nthink about such things.\nBut adults do think about these things, so where do children\nlearn about them? At the present time, the answer is that they learn\nabout them as events happen randomly in their lives. If they are lucky\nenough to have someone helpful to talk with about their experiences,\nthey may, in fact, become good at analyzing how the world works\nand making their predictions conscious. Getting better at prediction\nis the cornerstone of living one’s life in a satisfying way. One can, of\ncourse, get better at prediction by simply thinking about it—this is\nhow most people do that today, of course. But not everyone is capable\nof doing that and, clearly, most adults are not all that good at making\nimportant predictions in their own lives. (This is one reason that\nthere are bad marriages, financial counselors, clinical psychologists,\nand prisons.)\nWhat helps teach one to predict is to hear about the experience of\nothers and to be able to reflect on one’s own experience. This means\nthat having experiences to reflect upon, and people who are knowledgeable\nto discuss those experiences with, is at the cornerstone of\nlearning to predict effectively.\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 113\nThis should start as early as 1st grade (or age 5—I don’t really believe\nin grades).\nHow do we do it? We design experiences for children that are age\nappropriate and talk about what will happen in those experiences before\nthey do them and how they can learn from and improve upon\nthose experiences after they happen. Then they undergo a slightly\nmore complex experience that builds on what they learned. The process\nis simple enough. The question is what experiences to design,\nhow to design them. 2\nI should note that prediction is used as a teaching methodology in\nschools today, especially in reading. I suggested this in a book I wrote\nabout teaching reading in 1978, and since that time (not necessarily\nbecause of that book) it has become more common to use prediction\nto teach reading. Also, high school kids are asked to make predictions\nin courses that cover current events. Kids predict sporting events or\nthe sex of their in utero sibling.\nThe idea that kids can make predictions is not a really radical\npoint. My point is that prediction has to be the curriculum, not be\nancillary to the curriculum. If we want children to predict well, we\nneed to help them do that. As it stands now, they are on their own.\nAs adults who have not been taught to predict well, they will make\npoor life decisions, predicting wrongly about how people in their lives\n(bosses, spouses, children, co-workers, etc.) will behave toward them\nafter they take certain actions, for example. Yes, understanding is improved\nif one predicts the future actions of characters in a book one is\nreading—it helps a lot. And, reading is a skill that is very important.\nBut it also helps to understand how to predict daily actions better and\nhow to find out whether you were right and how to explain why you\nwere wrong. Doing this consistently makes you better at predicting\nsomething more important than what an author has a character do\nin a story.\nHow do we get good at making predictions about the outcome of\nactions? What outcomes do we need to predict?\nEvery action we take involves a prediction. When we put one foot\nin front of the other in an effort to move our bodies forward, we are\npredicting that this will work, that we won’t fall down, and that it\nwon’t hurt to do this. Sometimes we do fall or it does hurt. We learn\nthis and compensate next time. This is learning in its most basic form.\nAnd obviously, we have been learning about walking since we were\n114 Teaching Minds\nvery small. We keep learning about walking throughout our lives because\nthings change.\nBabies predict what will happen when they cry. They don’t start\nout making such predictions. They learn to expect results that they\nhave already experienced. These are scripts, and I have discussed them\nat length elsewhere. 3 Scripts are acquired naturally as a result of repeated\nsequences of events. We predict what will happen next because\nwe know the script. Scripts are not normally taught because they are\nreadily acquired from living. But what if you want to teach them? You\nmight want to teach them in a situation where someone’s new job is\na script and rather than learn that job from repeated experience, there\nis a desire to jump-start the process by simply teaching the script. How\ncan we do this?\nThere is also prediction that is not script-based. In other words,\nthere could well be a script but the predictor doesn’t know it. How can\none learn to predict well if one does not have a script?\nAnd lastly, there is often the need to predict when there couldn’t\npossibly be a script because what needs to be predicted is novel, at\nleast to the predictor. How can the prediction be made? More important,\nhow can someone be taught to predict in that kind of situation?\nThese, then, are the three aspects of prediction: learning a script;\nfunctioning without a script because it isn’t known; and predicting\nwhen there is no script.\nHow do we teach these things? Scripts are learned through repetition.\nNo one seeks to explain to a child that since she will be doing\nsomething again and again, she will now memorize the steps before\nshe tries it out for the first time. Instead, we take the child through\nthe steps until she has learned them. There is no need to try to teach a\nchild scripts (such as how restaurants function or airplane rides go or\nschool procedure works). We can say some words about these things,\nof course, but the learning comes from repeated practice no matter\nwhat we do.\nTeachers (and course designers) often fail to understand about\nteaching scripts. Talking about what a student will have to do later will\nnot help that student do what he is being asked to do. We don’t learn\nscripts consciously and thus aren’t likely to remember what we are\nconsciously told about what to do. We are conscious when we execute\na script—we are thinking about what will happen next—but not so\nmuch in words as in expectations of next events. We don’t talk about\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 115\none foot going in front of the other foot or think about it very much.\nSo if a teacher tries to teach us about it, it is doubtful that the words\nwill help us much. Scripts are practiced. We can prepare for them if\nthat makes people happy. We can tell a child what will happen when\nhe rides in an airplane for the first time, but it isn’t so that he can do\nwhat he is supposed to do so much as to make him more comfortable\nand less surprised by noises or procedures that might be upsetting.\nThe only way to really learn a script is to do it again and again.\nSo what does this tell us about teaching scripts? What if we don’t\nhave the time to allow a student to practice? This is, of course, what\nhappens in job-training situations. We tell someone what to do and\nhope they very quickly will learn how to do it. We can’t afford weeks\nof practice. So how do we teach scripts in that case?\nThe answer to this depends on the number of mistakes that it\nis possible to make while executing a script. The real issue in script\nexecution is, after all, not knowing the next steps, but knowing what\nto do (or what not to do) when the script begins to falter in some\nway. This means that a teacher (or a course designer) must have one\nquestion in mind when thinking about teaching a script: What are\nthe most common (and most important) mistakes that are made by\nnovices when they execute this script?\nTo teach people to avoid mistakes in a script, or to teach them to\nget out of difficult situations properly, one must practice those situations.\nThis means that script teaching must focus around errors and\nthat it is the job of a teacher to systematically make sure that everything\nthat could go wrong, does go wrong in any practice situation.\nTeaching scripts means helping the student form a case base of errors\nand a case base of how to handle them. Here again, this cannot be\ntaught consciously. Script failures must be taught through practice.\nThe students must build up their own case bases by experiencing the\nproblem and then either think their way out of it, or learn standard\nsolutions as a way out of it by practicing them. So, we can speed up\nthe script-learning process by creating a simulation that has every important\nmistake built into it waiting for the student to trip up and\nmake that mistake.\nWhen a script isn’t known and predictions need to be made, the\nusual human procedure is to adapt on old script to serve as a temporary\nnew one. Never been on a plane but have been on a train? Never\nbeen in a fancy restaurant but have been to a fast-food restaurant?\n116 Teaching Minds\nNever been to college but have been to high school? These are situations\nthat happen to people. They usually assume that one is like the\nother. While this assumption may not work out all that well, it is the\nbest a scriptless person can do in the situation.\nA teacher, therefore, can take advantage of this human desire to\nsee unknown A as being like known B. People do this all the time.\nThey assume the girl they just met will behave like the last one they\nwent out with. They assume that their teacher will behave the way\ntheir last teacher did. They assume that their new car works the way\nthe last one did. They do this with situations as well. What it means is\nthat people predict on the basis of experience and it is the job of the\nteacher to help students understand which of their prior experiences\nis most relevant when they are confused. Doing this is not so easy. But\nit is possible and it is a proper area for a teacher or a course to focus on.\nHere is the process. Students need to be asked what to do in a situation\nthat is new to them. Their natural response would be to rely on\nprior experience. The teacher’s job is to make that reliance explicit. To\nask students to say which experience they will rely on for help in the\nnew situation and ask why they think that that particular choice will\nbe helpful. To ask them to analyze the differences between the current\nissue and the prior script and to predict where the prior script might\nnot work. To ask them to think of alternative scripts that might help.\nWhat I have described here is the basic process of indexing cases\nand matching cases, which is critical to thinking—especially original\nthinking. No case is really exactly the same as one that came before.\nWe are used to partial matches when we use an old case to help with\na new one. What we are not used to is a discussion of why one match\nwas correct and why another was less helpful. Making case matching\na conscious process helps us understand something that we normally\ndo without much conscious thought. People need to learn to rely on\npartial matches and they need to know how to determine which partial\nmatch is most likely. I have referred to this process as case-based\nreasoning in many prior publications. 4 But I have not spoken about\nhow to teach case-based reasoning. This is where post hoc discussion\nis very important. An example of such a discussion can be found in\na book written by Harvard government professors 5 on the failure of\nPresident Ford to choose the right cases to reason from in a crisis. Usually\nthis kind of analysis is done as kind of an afterthought. However,\nteaching people to do it actually is critical to teaching people to predict\nproperly.\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 117\nHow do we teach prediction when there is no script and there are\nno seemingly relevant prior cases? In some sense we can’t. We can teach\npeople how to go about trying to make predictions. This is actually what\nscience is about. Scientists create theories that make predictions, which\nthey then try to verify with evidence. This process—hypotheses verified\nby evidence—can be taught in the sense that it is a way of thinking that\ncan be practiced in various venues. It is reasonable to start teaching children\nto think in this way about the world around them. As for adults,\nteaching scientific reasoning in the context of corporate training is\nprobably a less than optimal place to start. People in corporations need\nto be able to reason from evidence and to understand what data would\nconfirm or deny the value of actions they have taken for the benefit of\nthe company. This, of course, is scientific reasoning. But, unfortunately,\nthe people who go into the business world tend to have never practiced\nscientific reasoning in their educational careers because they weren’t\ninterested in science. But they must be interested in predicting well in\norder to succeed in business.\nHOW TO TEACH MODELING\nBuilding a model of a process is very difficult for a child to do and not\nso easy for an adult to do either. When you teach computer science,\nyou learn this quickly enough. Computer programs are models of processes.\nPeople try to write computer programs by creating diagrams\nthat model what happens first and then what happens next, and so\non. These models are almost never right the first time.\nProgrammers learn to debug their programs, which means they\ncontinue to try to get their model to be accurate. But most people\ncannot do this very easily, and it is a very important skill. Knowing\nhow to raise money is important if one wants to start a business, for\nexample. The money-raising process can be understood, but one has\nto examine it and go through it.\nThis is just as true of ordering in a restaurant. Children may seem\nto know about ordering in a restaurant, but they may not understand\nmoney or service or having a job exactly and thus may have an erroneous\nmodel of the process. Why does the waitress bring food, is a\ncomplex question for a 5-year-old, but also an important one. Building\nmodels of how and why things work as they do, is significant for\nchildren to learn to do.\n118 Teaching Minds\nThe way to do this is to look at processes that children engage\nin during the course of their daily lives and have them first explain\nhow and why the processes work and then try to improve upon them.\nThey could carefully examine the operations of the school cafeteria,\nfor example. Of course, this has to be done in line with the interests\nthat the children actually have. The idea is building the model, not\ntelling them what models they have to build. Every child has an interest—animals,\nsports, family, cars, dinosaurs, whatever. Children need\nto learn to model the processes that interest them in order to better\nunderstand them and to make them better. Children will learn about\nthe modeling process from working on a car engine, for example, if\nthey are taught to think about what is going on in a deep way rather\nthan just learning a set of facts about how the car runs. This is true in\nany area of interest, from medicine to government to science.\nAdults have a difficult time with models at work, as citizens, at\nhome, and so on. They don’t always know how things really work. To\nget people to be better at understanding the processes that they engage\nin daily life, they need to be able to model them. This ability has\nto be taught and practiced early..\nOf course, kids have been building models of actual objects for a\nlong time. Using a kit to build a model airplane is fun but it doesn’t\nteach you much about how planes fly. More detailed models of physical\nobjects are very helpful.\nBuilding a medieval castle, for example, sounds like fun to me,\nand there are things to be learned from doing this, of course. It is a\ngood activity for little kids, but modeling involves social processes as\nwell. Kids need to understand how the world works, so it isn’t the\ncastle itself that is so important but perhaps a model of the society\naround the castle, and the need for the castle, that would matter in\nthis instance.\nHOW TO TEACH EXPERIMENTATION\nEveryone experiments all the time. We eat foods that we hope won’t\nmake us fat or might make us healthy. We take drugs that are supposed\nto help us, and maybe they do maybe they don’t. We try out relationships\nthat may or may not work. We experiment with jobs, hobbies,\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 119\nhomes, cars, toys, games, lifestyles, behaviors, hairdos. . . . The list is\nseemingly infinite.\nWe may not see ourselves as experimenting when we try out something\nnew. We often experiment ineffectively. Learning to experiment\nin a reasonable way is yet again something that can be done only\nthrough experience. But, in this case, there really is an experimental\nprocess to be learned. It can be taught early on by finding simple experiments\nthat small children really are interested in doing—they do\nnot all have to do the same ones since it doesn’t matter what they do.\nThey can learn to attempt to control the variables and see what happens\nin a variety of circumstances. This is, again, the scientific method,\nbut the issue is really not teaching science so much as it is teaching\na scientific approach to gathering useful knowledge. What constitutes\nevidence and how to draw conclusions are the kinds of things that a\nteacher can help with. Here again, a case base is acquired and relied on\nthroughout this process. The discussion of findings so that they can be\nmentally indexed is very important part of the process.\nBut how do we find out what is true? Ask any 5-year-old this\nquestion and the answer is not very likely to be, We run an experiment.\nAsk mommy, is more likely or, Ask the teacher, if the kid is in\nschool.\nBut, testing hypotheses is a critical part of learning to think. Of\ncourse, one has to have a hypothesis first. Children are rarely asked\nfor their hypotheses about things. This is not exactly odd because although\nchildren do have them, it is a weird kind of discussion to have\nwith a 5-year-old. Nevertheless, it is important to do. Teaching children\nto form and test hypotheses is as simple as asking them to do it.\nBut, here again, asking them to do it must be done within the context\nof something they really care about. There have been many attempts\nover the course of educational history to teach kids science by having\nthem run experiments; sometimes they are asked simply to replicate\nold experiments and sometimes they are asked to try new ideas out\nand figure things out for themselves. While the latter is most certainly\npreferable, these experiments tend to be about testing water quality,\nor nutrients in the soil, subjects that are not exactly on the mind of a\n5-year-old.\nWhat is on the mind of a 5-year-old? He might be wondering\nabout how to deal with his baby sister. Or he might be wondering\n120 Teaching Minds\nhow best to throw a rock in order to hit the cat. For many of these\nthings, hypotheses can be formed, discussions about what makes a\ngood hypothesis can be had, and ideas for testing out hypotheses can\nbe sought. Maybe these would just be thought experiments (as in the\ncase of hitting the cat), but thought experiments are important also.\nKnowing what would confirm or deny a hypothesis is important.\nFinding out what kids want to get better at is part of the issue here.\nIf they want to learn to hit a baseball, having a theory about what\nmakes a good swing and what makes a bad one may matter to them.\nThe subject matter doesn’t matter at all really, just the thinking and\nthe experimentation.\nThis suggests that the real way to teach experimentation and the\nother subjects we have discussed here is to group kids not by age but\nby interests. So, if a child wants to think about dogs all day, group him\nwith a set of other dog lovers and start coming up with hypotheses\nabout dogs’ behavior, needs, commands that they might learn, training,\nbreeding, and so on. It just doesn’t matter what the subject is at\nthis stage.\nSuggestions for kids’ science experiments are everywhere. Here is\na typical one:\nGravity\nThe Earth tries to pull everything down toward its center. This\npull is called the force of gravity (the invisible force). When you\nlift things up, you have to pull against gravity. If you drop a\npencil, gravity pulls it to Earth. If you rest its midpoint on your\nfinger, gravity will pull down equally on both sides of the pencil\nand it will balance in the air.\nHere is another:\nSound and Noise\nHave one person fill each of the plastic eggs with a different item.\nPut some rice in one, some dried beans in another, and so on.\nKeep track of what you put in each egg by writing numbers on\nthe eggs. Have a different person try to see if he can figure out\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 121\nwhat is inside each egg by shaking and listening to the sound\ngenerated. After he takes a first guess, show him the list of what\nitems are in each egg and have him guess again. See if he changes\nhis mind about some of the previous guesses. Now open the eggs\nand see how close the guesses were to what was actually inside\neach egg.\nNow, let’s make a musical instrument called a kazoo. Cut a\nsmall square of wax paper about 1 inch larger than the end of the\ncardboard tube. After doing that, wrap the wax paper over one\nof the ends of the tube and put a rubber band over the paper to\nhold it in place. Now, put the open end of your kazoo up to your\nmouth and hum a tune into it. Notice how the kazoo buzzes and\nvibrates to amplify (make louder) the sound of your voice.\nOf course, this is not exactly what I have in mind when I suggest focusing\nschool on experimentation. Say the word experiment and the word\nscience usually follows right away. This is unfortunate because most\nkids won’t become scientists any time soon. Also, most kids already\nknow what they are being asked to “experiment” about. They know\nthe pencil falls and they know you can make noise by blowing through\nthings. They may not understand how all this works, but they won’t\nunderstand much more after doing these so-called “experiments.”\nExperiments in the larger sense are about attempts to find out\nwhat is true about things you are uncertain about. The issue is how\nto do that when you are wondering about something. To do this we\nneed to constantly deal with what kids are worrying about and ask\nthem to determine how they can find out what is true. This is experimentation\nthat can be helped by teachers. It needs to be individually\nfocused, however. You can’t have a class worry collectively about any\none thing. Each kid has his own concerns.\nHOW TO TEACH EVALUATION\nFor an issue that is so important to so many people, it is astonishing\nhow difficult this seems to be. Just say no to drugs campaigns don’t\nwork and people wonder why. Abstinence campaigns don’t work\nand people wonder why. It is not all that mysterious. You can’t teach\n122 Teaching Minds\nevaluation verbally. Since children naturally copy their parents, it is\nnot that complicated to figure out where children acquire their initial\nvalues. And, since values are not typically stated (my father never said\nliquor at 5 p.m. is a good thing), it certainly isn’t through lectures that\nwe learn values. I learned to drink at 5 p.m. from my father. He wasn’t\ntrying to teach me that. I learned to gamble from my father. He wasn’t\ntrying to teach me that either. I learned to be argumentative from my\nfather. He wasn’t trying to teach that. I did not learn algebra from my\nfather. That, he was trying to teach me.\nMy son wanted to grow up and sip Pepsi. He told me this constantly\nas he was growing up. It did not matter that I hadn’t drunk Pepsi for\n10 years at the point when he was saying that. He was impressed that I\nhad done this when he was 3 and he was frustrated that I didn’t allow\nhim to drink it. Presto, another family value is learned.\nChildren learn the family values that their family actually has.\nTeenage mothers who warn against getting pregnant at a young age\nmay say that in words, but their actions say that their kid is alive and\nwell and it all worked out.\nSo, it follows that we don’t have to consciously teach values because\nwe teach them without saying a word. Values are held subconsciously\nand learned subconsciously. We can only hope that we have\nset a good example. That having been said, there will still be those\nwho ask how we can teach values. You can’t expect that “you can’t,”\nwill work as an answer.\nI mentioned in Chapter 3 that there are lots of things that you\ncan’t teach. I mentioned honesty as an example. Honesty is, of course,\na value. Now let’s ask whether you can teach people to be more honest\nthan they are naturally inclined to be. The answer is that to do\nthis, you have to turn a subconscious process into a conscious one.\nYou would need to provide case after case and experience after experience\nto a student that all led to the conclusion that honesty simply\nworks out better in the long run. This is, of course, what abstinence\nand say no to drugs campaigns endeavor to do. They want to argue\nkids into believing that things they think are fun, are bad. But how\ncan we make that argument? The argument we can make is that these\nthings aren’t as much fun as you think, so try them and see for yourself—but\nthat kind of ruins the basic premise about not doing them\nin the first place. So, in principle there is no way to argue kids into\nnot doing what looks like fun to them and what doesn’t seem to have\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 123\nhurt anyone very much. The idea of showing pain is big in values\ncampaigns. Campaigns against drunk driving like to show students\ndead drivers and awful car crashes. But they miss the real point. Have\nthe students seen their parents drink and drive or friends drink and\ndrive? Are they dead? If not, these campaigns will have little impact\nsince values are subconsciously held.\nThere is a way to teach these things but it isn’t easy. Imagine that\nyou wanted to teach teenagers not to drive drunk. You could create a\nsimulation of drunkenness that asked students to drive drunk while\nnot being able to hold their heads steady, blacking out from time to\ntime, and seeing very badly. In other words, instilling a new emotion\ninto the mix can alter values. Make people afraid of something they\nwant to do and that fear will manifest itself when it is time to do it.\nEmotions can be induced into subconscious processes and decisionmaking\nthrough experience. Emotions can change values.\nThere is a sense in which appreciation cannot be taught. You like\nit or you don’t. I have two grandsons. The 5-year-old (my daughter’s\nchild) has announced that he doesn’t want to have anything to do\nwith a ball. The 3-year-old (my son’s child) goes wild with excitement\nwhen he sees ballgames being played and responds excitedly when\nballs are given to him. What is the difference and how did this happen?\nThe difference is obvious: One appreciates the art of it and one\ndoesn’t. How this happened is less clear, but the parenting is very different\nwith respect to balls in each house. There are other, biological\ndifferences as well. The 3-year-old has much taller parents and is\nalready the same size as the 5-year-old. He is much more physical as\nwell.\nSo, the question is, Could we teach the 5-year-old to love balls and\nballgames, and could we teach the 3-year-old to hate balls and ballgames?\nThe answer to this is obvious. We could do this. It might be\nhard but people are, unfortunately, quite good at negative reinforcement,\nso it is possible to make people change their attitudes by using\nit as a method.\nIs there a way to teach the positive? Can we get someone to appreciate\na work of art who does not respond immediately to works of\nart? Can we get someone to appreciate classical music who does not\nhave any interest in it?\nThis is, of course, what many art history or music appreciation\ncourses endeavor to do. Their methodology is always the same:\n124 Teaching Minds\nrepeated exposure and analysis. It always involves a lot of talking. And\ntherein lies the problem. Since appreciation and enjoyment are subconscious\nprocesses, it stands to reason that these processes are best\naddressed by a methodology that is less conscious. Telling me why I\nshould like something is not likely to do much more than teach me\nhow to talk about something as if I liked it. I can point out the finer\npoints of baseball to you, but if you don’t care, I won’t be able to get\nyou to go to the next baseball game.\nOn the other hand, of course, you certainly won’t like baseball if\nyou have never seen it played. Exposure is the key to teaching subconscious\nprocesses. Add to that an enjoyable atmosphere surrounding\nthe experience, especially if it is early on in one’s life, associated with\nthe artistry you want to teach, and it is likely that the learner will learn\nto like whatever he is being exposed to. So, evaluation, which starts\nout as a subconscious process, must be taught by enabling copying\nand repeated practice, but cannot easily be taught verbally.\nHOW TO TEACH DIAGNOSIS\nDiagnosis is the same and it is different. Many different people do diagnosis\nunder many different circumstances. But, the process is always\nthe same. So it seems normal to ask why an expert in doing diagnosis\nin one area cannot do diagnosis nearly as well in another area of\nknowledge. Why can’t a doctor fix his own car? Why can’t a detective\nfigure out why a business is failing? It is all diagnosis after all.\nDiagnosis is best taught early on but it can be taught at any age.\nIn the end, it is just about knowing what counts as evidence and how\nto create and rule out hypotheses. The general process of gathering\nevidence and testing hypotheses is the same no matter what you are\ndoing. This is true in principle, of course, not in actual fact. In reality,\ndoctors cannot rule out hypotheses by tests that might harm the patient.\nBusinesspeople cannot rule out hypotheses by running control\nbusinesses that may lose money while others make money. Detectives\ncannot spoil a crime scene by altering the evidence. Mechanics cannot\ntry something that might make things worse. Investors cannot control\nworld events that might make a seemingly correct hypothesis still not\nwork out all that well.\nTo teach diagnosis, simple problems can be worked on that lead to\nmore complex problems. What is being taught, apart from the process\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 125\nitself, is the knowledge that underlies the hypothesis and understanding\nwhat constitutes evidence and the consequences of evidence. This\nknowledge is very domain specific and is the reason that doctors don’t\nnecessarily make good car mechanics, and vice versa. This knowledge\ncan be acquired only through practice and experience and can be acquired\nonly consciously. Diagnosis is thus a conscious process that is\nvery knowledge dependent. There is no seat-of-the-pants diagnosis,\nnamely, diagnosis that is seemingly subconscious, although it may\nwell seem that way. Having an intuition is usually just the result of\nhaving a great deal of experience, so much so that hypotheses just\njump out at you because similar cases are so easily recognizable to an\nexpert. Someone who is good at diagnosis would be good at diagnosis\nin any domain of knowledge if they knew how to gather and interpret\nevidence in that domain.\nDiagnosis is clearly very difficult to learn. Most people are rather\nbad at it outside of their own areas of interest. Even inside their knowledge\nbase they can be sloppy in the reasoning and leap to wrong conclusions.\nThis is true of all analytic skills. It is possible to never learn\nto do them well.\nHOW TO TEACH PLANNING\nPlanning is extremely important and typical of an analytic cognitive\nprocess; it is something that some people simply never learn to do\nwell. Teaching planning must be focused around the assembly of a\ncase base. Planning is taught in many domains of knowledge and is\nalmost always taught wrong. The classic error is to teach the theory of\nplanning, means–ends analysis, a theory of urban planning, spatial\nplanning, military planning, and logic-based artificial intelligence\nplanning. Such courses all make the same mistake. Course designers\nthink people use theories when, in fact, when people plan, they simply\ntry to adapt old plans that have worked before to new situations.\nOften people don’t plan at all. They simply assume that a set of actions\nthey intend to perform will work to achieve an expected goal.\nTeaching planning is therefore a tedious process that is best begun\nin childhood. It involves making plans, seeing how they play out,\nand performing an analysis of what went wrong. Often people are\nnot even aware that they have made a plan, and are simply frustrated\nwhen things go wrong. They almost never perform an after-action\n126 Teaching Minds\nreview (as the military calls the analysis process that takes place after\na plan has been implemented).\nTeaching planning means teaching about goals, how they typically\nare achieved, what obstacles might be encountered, and how to\ndeal with them. The principles of planning are the same no matter\nwhat domain you are in, so children can learn to plan birthday parties,\nhikes, class trips, how to deal with their problems, how to treat\ntheir little sister, how to get along with their parents, and so on. This\nprocess can be learned by copying, seeing how others deal with these\nthings, adapting a plan that has worked before, and so on. A teacher\nwho tries to teach planning from first principles is teaching something\nthat is easily forgotten as well as teaching a process that doesn’t occur\nthat much in real life. Chefs adapt old recipes or parts of old recipes.\nGenerals adapt old battle plans or parts of old battle plans. Computer\nprogrammers use code that has worked before. Planning without a prior\nplan in mind really is quite unusual and generally not a good idea.\nPlanning, like diagnosis, should be a basic part of all curricula in\nschool at all ages. People make plans all the time. They plan their\nlunch, they plan their day, they plan their trips, they plan their errands,\nand, of course, they plan their lives. It is astonishing that we\ndon’t teach planning all the time in every aspect of life. But we don’t\nbecause this doesn’t seem very academic. Since it is not explicitly\ntaught to children, it is reasonable to ask how we might best teach\nplanning to adults. Corporations want to teach financial planning,\nresource planning, supply chain planning, creating business plans,\ncreating marketing plans, and so on. Planning is, in fact, one of the\nmajor preoccupations of business, as well it should be. So, how do we\nteach it?\nThe problem here is that planning really works in only one way.\nIt is relies on a case base. We plan by adapting old plans. That’s how\nwe do it. We store old plans and we retrieve them when we need them\nagain; we change them so they apply to the new situation or change\nthem so that this time they will work out when they failed before. But\nwe always start with an old plan. New planners, those we are trying to\nteach how to plan, cannot help but do this, even if they do not have\na relevant old plan to work from. They simply will choose the best\nplan they have, even though it might not be all that germane to the\ncurrent situation. Proverbs—for example, to a man with a hammer,\neverything is a nail—don’t come from nowhere.\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 127\nThus, when we teach planning, there is either a lot to undo, or we\nmust start from the beginning. We can try to explain why each and\nevery old plan is not really helpful in a new situation, or we can teach\na series of plans that are relevant. In other words, if you are trying to\nteach people to write a business plan, you need to start with a lemonade\nstand and work up. If you are trying to teach financial planning,\nyou need to start with a child’s allowance and work up. If you want to\nteach battle planning, try a tug of war first. This is what should have\noccurred in childhood. If it didn’t, it needs to be restarted that way for\nadults. We need to use, again and again, plans in different situations\nthat are simple and begin to analyze why they fail. (And these plans\nmust fail, at least in simulation, or no real learning will occur.)\nPlanning is very difficult. It must start simple and be practiced\nsimply for a while or it never becomes second nature. Plans must fail,\nat least in simulation, because analysis of what went wrong is a critical\npart of planning. If you aren’t analyzing what went wrong, you aren’t\nlearning to plan. Your case base will not end up having been indexed\nwell enough to enable you to pick and choose appropriate plans in\nthe future.\nHOW TO TEACH CAUSATION\nAt the root of diagnosis and planning is causation. Detecting cause\nis an essential part of diagnosis, and anticipating cause is an important\naspect of planning. Causation must be understood in order to do\nmany things in this world. One needs to know what causes what. Science\ncourses in school attempt to teach causation by having students\nmemorize F = ma, or having them imitate chemistry experiments, or\nhaving them dissect a frog. While there is nothing wrong with any\nof that in principle, it really doesn’t teach causation in a way that is\nparticularly useful to a functioning adult.\nWhile diagnosis and planning may not be recognized as critical\nskills by schools, causation is, although not under that word. Causation\nis understood as being what science is all about, and when\nschools endeavor to teach science, they are in fact trying to teach\ncausation. This is true for social science as well. History is about causation,\nas is psychology. The fact that these subjects are not talked\nabout in this way indicates something important about them.\n128 Teaching Minds\nSubject- based education makes the academic disciplines the center\nof what needs to be learned, when there is really something else at\nthe base of learning. All human learning and all scientific inquiry is\nabout causation; attempts to determine what causes what, and why,\nare what it means to be a scientist or an academic. Theories of causation,\nand tests to see whether those theories are true, are what it\nmeans to be a scientist.\nThe problem is that telling students that causation is part of science\nmakes them think about physics formulas and fact memorization\nwhen the real issue in teaching causation is how to determine what\ncauses what, rather than how to memorize what causes what. There\nare, of course, facts about causation that are worth knowing. It is nice\nto know that if you let go of something, it may fall, but it is not necessary\nto know that gravity is the issue in this. The world went on quite\nwell for millions of years before Newton. People certainly understood\nbefore Newton that things would fall when you let go of them and\nnothing else was supporting them. Scientific explanations of causation\nare nice for scientists but not necessary for everyday humans.\nWhat everyday people need to know is how to determine what causes\nwhat in areas of their own interest. They can hear you tell them about\ncausation—the stock market always goes down when a Democrat is\nelected president—but they need to be able to decide whether what\nyou said is true and whether it is the election that causes the decline\nor something else.\nUnderstanding about causation is much more a function of being\nable to figure out what caused what in any given instance than it is the\nmemorization of facts about science. Of course, with known cases, as\nwe have seen, being able to extrapolate from one case to another is a\ngood way of determining what is likely to happen. There is no harm in\nknowing prior cases and great value in being able to use them. But, as\nalways, cases are better learned from one’s own experience than from\nbeing told about them.\nTeaching causation, therefore, means teaching the process of determining\nwhat happened in any given situation. Since there is a\ngreat deal to learn about any domain of inquiry in order to determine\ncausation, the main issue is how to know what the facts are\nand how to reason from them. This means that, yet again, it is the\ndomain of knowledge that needs to be learned, and this entails constant\npractice in that domain. And, the methodology of determining\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 129\ncausation needs to be learned. This, too, can depend on the particular\ndomain of inquiry. Reasoning from all this takes practice as well.\nDetermining cause is a critical cognitive process that underlies nearly\nall thinking.\nHOW TO TEACH JUDGMENT\nHow do we get good at making a judgment? Judgments are a kind of\nprediction, of course. When a judge sentences a criminal, he is, in a\nsense, making a prediction about what will happen in the rest of this\nperson’s life. But he also is making decision that is no way a prediction,\nbut simply serves as punishment. Similarly, when we decide that\na certain restaurant is our favorite, we are predicting something about\nhow much we will enjoy future experiences, but we also are making\na decision that may or may not matter to others, that is, a recommendation.\nRecommendations are also predictions, but they have a\ndifferent feel. When a boss decides whom to promote, he is predicting\nsomething about future behavior but, again, the prediction isn’t the\nkey point. A judgment is a decision that has some import.\nNevertheless, as different as judgments and predictions may or\nmay not be, the process of teaching them is identical. Good judgment\nis learned by making judgments and analyzing the results or\ntruth of those judgments as more information becomes available. After\na judgment is made it too becomes one of one’s cases and stories.\nCases about judgment can be learned only by making simple judgments\nand getting smarter about the process over time on the basis\nof experience.\nJudgments can be made in two ways that matter here. Either someone\ncan decide to do one thing versus another thing based on ethical,\nmoral, avaricious, or emotional grounds, or for many other reasons.\nJudgments aren’t so different from decisions in this aspect. Teaching\nsomeone to make a judgment of this sort, between A and B, can be\ndone by putting students in situations in which such judgments need\nto be made and then going over with them how they decided and\nwhat they may have left out of their thinking.\nA different kind of judgment is made when one judges the behavior\nof others. Judges do this, of course, as do compliance officers in\ncompanies, and teachers with respect to student mistakes.\n130 Teaching Minds\nChildren normally make judgments about the behavior of their\nparents and friends as well. In all these cases, judgment is best taught\nby having a student watch the behavior of others, keeping himself out\nof the issue and seeing what factors motivated and determined the\nbehavior of the actors. It is a lot easier to teach proper behavior when\nit is not one’s own behavior that is being judged. One can learn to act\nby judging how others act.\nSo, children make judgments all the time. Typically those judgments\nreflect the values that they have been taught at home. Children\ndecide what is good and what is bad mostly based on what they have\nbeen told. No child discovers for himself that George Washington was\nan admirable man. No child decides on his own that the United States\nis the best country in the world. These things are taught by parents\nand by schools. School, to the extent that it serves as a place of indoctrination,\nhas always succeeded at producing citizens who believe\nwhat they are taught to believe at a young age. There obviously is a\ngreat deal of sentiment for keeping indoctrination as a key part of\neducation, but teaching judgment means allowing children to come\nto conclusions based on their own experience and not merely what\nthey were told.\nLearning to make judgments is a process of deciding for oneself\nwhat is true, which is, of course, not so easy. This should be the role of\nschool but it usually isn’t. School wants to teach us the truth when, in\nfact, truth is best discovered, again, from experience.\nHow would one discover the “best country in the world,” if that\nis a meaningful idea, or whether George Washington was all he was\ncracked up to be? Obviously, travel helps teach one about countries.\nKids can learn about countries by simulated travel in the modern era.\nBut the point wouldn’t be so much to teach them that they make good\ncheese in France, which is the kind of thing school does today, but to\nthink about what makes France different from the United States. Similarly,\nwe can read and learn some facts about George Washington, and\nthese are indeed taught to children in primary school. I do not believe\nthat children are equipped at a young age to determine for themselves\nwhether Washington was a good man. Perhaps that would be a worthwhile\nassignment in high school, as long as students were interested\nin the question and were allowed to come to any conclusion that they\ncould reasonably defend. But children of 5 or 6 can understand what\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 131\na hero is and what leadership is, and they can determine for themselves\nwho they know or have seen who is good at both. Again, real\nexperiences and discussions are how one learns to think about this,\nbut it must be done in an environment of possible truths, not predetermined\ntruths. One doesn’t create a nation of people who can think\nby telling them what they should think. Kids know who is the leader\namong them. They should learn to discuss what it is about their leader\nthat makes them want to follow. This is difficult discussion to have\nwith a 6-year-old, but it gets easier with age.\nOnce again, asking kids to make judgments isn’t that unusual.\nHere is a remark from a parenting book that I happened upon:\nWhen adults praise their kids for smart judgments, the kids glow.\nBut here’s the clincher: kids earn more and more freedom and\nindependence when parents trust their judgments more and\nmore. 6\nThe issue here is, yet again, not whether kids make judgments, but\nwhether they are taught, as a central part of what they study, how to\nmake judgments.\nThe cognitive processes depend on reasoning from evidence in a\nway that makes sense. This is not something people are naturally good\nat. They often exhibit faulty reasoning. Practicing reasoning means\npracticing within particular domains of knowledge. Reasoning is the\nsame process no matter what you are reasoning about, but we don’t\nreason about nothing. Learning the actual facts is important, but it\nis the idea that this is important that has sent the school systems on\nthe wrong path. Academics study the facts, as well they should, but\nthey also teach the facts, which is a grievous error. How to determine\nthe facts and how to determine their effects on a situation is what the\nprocesses of diagnosis, planning, and causation are all about.\nHOW TO TEACH INFLUENCE\nThis is yet another childhood skill. Children learn how to influence\ntheir parents and their siblings and their friends very early on. Of\ncourse, they may not learn these things in a good way. They might\nlearn that temper tantrums or bullying works very well.\n132 Teaching Minds\nTeaching people how to influence people involves putting them\nin situations where it is possible to influence people and seeing how it\ngoes. There is nothing to learn exactly. We try behaviors and see what\nworks. What works for one person may not work for another. One way\nor another, we learn how to get what we want, or we learn to hang\nout with people who will respond to our needs. This is basically a subconscious\nprocess. We are so busy working on this at a very young age\nthat we may not have any idea what it is we know or how to improve\nwhat we do. Of course, there is a conscious part as well. Someone can\ntell us that we will catch more flies with honey than with vinegar,\nand we can, if we think about it, adjust our behavior. But aphorisms\nabout what works and what doesn’t work aren’t always correct and\nare highly idiosyncratic. Although there are books about how to win\nfriends and influence people, the reality is that, apart from adopting a\nphony personality, people are who they are, more or less.\nBut this does not mean they can’t be taught what works. It usually\ndoes mean that they can be taught what works as a result of their own\nexperience. And, they can be taught what doesn’t work as a result of\ntheir own experience. But this isn’t at all easy. If it were, psychiatrists\nwould not be able to make a living. You can tell a person to change\nhis behavior, you can even tell him exactly what to do when, but he is\nlikely not going to be able to do what you say.\nThe way influence is taught currently is probably the way it has to\nbe taught, then, by use of mentors who look at your behavior and talk\nyou through why you do what you do. This same mentoring method\ncan be used in corporate settings. Simulations may not be so effective\nbecause while we may know and be able to say the right answer, this\ndoesn’t mean that we can execute the desired behavior in reality.\nHOW TO TEACH TEAMWORK\nTeamwork is learned by working in teams. It is a mixed process because,\nhere again, we behave in ways that are not so conscious but\nwe can make conscious changes. Leaders learn to manage teams by\nthinking about what works and what doesn’t. Quarterbacks must\nlearn to manage their teammates. If they don’t, it really doesn’t matter\nhow well they can throw the ball. Team members have to want\nto work hard for the leader, and the leader has to know how to motivate\neach team member. People are different so what works for one\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 133\nmay not work for another. A leader learns to figure out who is who\nand what works for each member of the team. The conscious part of\nthis is about learning who needs what from the leader in order for\nthe leader to get the most out of each individual so that the team’s\ngoals are achieved. The subconscious part is about interacting with\nothers, which is rarely conscious behavior. We get smarter through\nexperience. If our team wins because we functioned well as a team,\nwe learn to repeat the behaviors that worked. If we win because our\nteam was simply much bigger than the other team, then we probably\nwon’t learn much about teamwork.\nTeamwork can be taught only by examining how a team functions\nand attempting to make conscious the subconscious behavior that is\nnot working. Thinking about what we have done that may not have\nbeen helpful to the team, and making sure that team members’ goals\nare aligned, is pretty much the only way we can learn to improve our\nbehavior.\nHOW TO TEACH NEGOTIATION\nMy daughter was a little over 2 when we moved back to the United\nStates from Switzerland. The enormity of U.S. toy stores overwhelmed\nher and it seemed that she wound up crying every time we entered\none. She wanted everything. So I had what I thought was a clever idea.\nI told her that she could have two toys of her choice but that if she\ncried she couldn’t get any at all. We talked about it and it was clear that\nshe had understood what I said. She ran around the toy store and ended\nup selecting three toys. I told her one would have to go back—that\nour agreement was two. She started crying hysterically. I then said she\nhad to put them all back as she had violated our no crying agreement.\nAll of sudden, she sucked up all her tears and said in a breathless voice:\nI’m not crying now. I said that we would compromise on one toy.\nThat was possibly her first lesson in negotiating. I say possibly\nbecause kids and parents negotiate all the time. She and I are still negotiating.\nNow it is about when she will come to visit or when she will\nsend her son down to visit or a range of other family issues.\nNegotiation is so important that it is nearly absurd to ask how we\nteach negotiation. We can learn it by copying, of course, which I did\nwhen I watched my father get a good price on a used car I was buying\nthat I was ready to pay much more for. But really we negotiate with\n134 Teaching Minds\nour wives and children and friends and co-workers all the time.\nIt is possible to teach negotiation, of course. My team once built\na course on negotiation, working with a Harvard Law professor 7 who\ntaught negotiation. The course worked by having people negotiate.\nThe situations were artificial so there is some question as to how valuable\nlessons can be learned from negotiating when nothing important\n(except ego) depends on it. What I found most interesting about that\ncourse were the stories that the expert told from his life as a professional\nnegotiator. I can’t say that I was ever able to personally make\nuse of the lessons that those stories taught, but other people’s experiences\nare interesting to think about. In the end, what we really know\nabout negotiation is what has worked well for us in the course of our\nlives when we were negotiating. Coaching can help, of course, which\nimplies that the best way to teach negotiation would be with a mentor\nwatching you do it for real and offering tips. Psychologists perform\nthis service in couples counseling, and presumably real estate agents\nperform this service for homebuyers and sellers. Just-in-time advice is\nalways helpful.\nHOW TO TEACH DESCRIBING\nThere is a famous quote: “I apologize that this letter is so long—I\nlacked the time to make it short.”8 As long as people have been talking,\nthey have had to learn to talk well. When they learned to write,\nthey had to learn to write well. Communication is a very big part of\nliving in a society and those who communicate well gain all kinds of\nadvantages. It is difficult to attain public office without speaking well,\nor to become an important academic without writing well, or to make\nsales or convince anyone of anything without making your case well.\nThis takes practice and coaching, and there is no substitute for either.\nOne also has to have something to say, so this means one has to\nhave had experiences to talk and write about. Further, it helps if one\nis writing about something that one is passionate about. Asking kids\nto write about their summer vacations doesn’t necessarily make them\ninto good writers. Asking kids to give speeches about George Washington\nfails for reasons of lack of passion. People need to learn to describe\nwell what is most important to them. And, they must be doing this\nHow to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 135\nin every task they undertake. They must talk about and write about\nwhat they do until the description process becomes second nature to\nthem. So, describing cannot be taught in and of itself. It must be part\nand parcel of other events students undertake. Writing classes make\nno sense, therefore. They exist because of the subject-based divisions\nin school. Writing and speaking must be part of everything that is going\non.\nSUMMARY\nProficiency at all the cognitive processes depends on discovery and\nbeing able to extrapolate from one’s experience about what has been\ndiscovered. These processes depend strongly on prior cases, and prior\ncases are best learned slowly in childhood. They also depend on an\nanalysis of those cases, which is best done with help from a teacher.\nDiscussion, reflection, and analysis of prior cases make one better able\nto deal with new cases. New cases must be compared with old ones\nin a way that helps one reason better from them. This comparison is\nthe basis of teaching analytic cognitive processes. Learning cognitive\nprocesses means having prior experiences with events that are similar\nto current events and being able to extrapolate from them. When we\ngo to a doctor, we want one who has seen our problem, and described\nit to others, many times before. Only then can we detect the nuances\nof difference that will determine an effective course of action.\nTeaching cognitive processes means providing students with experiences,\nhopefully each one more complex than the one before,\nand helping students discuss those experiences and compare one with\nanother. Knowledge is experience, but it is experience that has been\nanalyzed so that it can be retrieved again just in time as needed. This\nwill happen only if we have thought about what we have experienced.\nA teacher’s job, therefore, is to help provide the experiences and\nto help the student reflect upon the significance of those experiences.\nGood parents do this naturally. Good teachers would do it naturally as\nwell, if they were allowed to do so. Helping someone see the world in\na new way is pretty much what good teaching is all about.\n\nCHAPTER 10\nDefining Intelligence\nAll our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to\nthe understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing\nhigher than reason.\n—Immanuel Kant\nWhat is school for? A common answer is, to make people more knowledgeable.\nAnother is, to socialize them and prepare them for living\nwith others. Another is, to make them ready for work. (This last one\nseems almost laughable because it is clearly untrue in the modern\nworld, but people do seem to still believe it.) Another is, to prepare\nthem for more school. (People take this one very seriously.) My answer\nis: School should make people more intelligent.\nReally? Can we make people more intelligent? There are those\nwho would argue, and I am quite sure they are right, that intelligence\nis genetic: It can’t be altered by school, one way or the other.\nNevertheless, I think that school should make students more\nintelligent.\nHow can I believe both things?\nIt all depends on how you define intelligence. Let’s think about intelligence\nthe way ordinary people define it when they say that someone\nseems dumb or that someone seems to be very smart. There is a\nlot to be learned by considering seriously the folk view of intelligence\nas opposed to the classical school/testing view.\nIn the 2007 Miss Teen USA contest, Miss South Carolina responded\nto this question:\n“Recent polls have shown that a fifth of Americans can’t locate\nthe United States on a world map. Why do you think this is?”\n137\n138 Teaching Minds\nIn this way:\n“I personally believe, that U.S. Americans, are unable to do so,\nbecause uh, some, people out there, in our nation don’t have\nmaps, and uh . . . I believe that our education like such as in\nSouth Africa, and the Iraq, everywhere like such as . . . and, I\nbelieve they should uh, our education over here, in the U.S.\nshould help the U.S. or should help South Africa, and should\nhelp the Iraq and Asian countries so we will be able to build up\nour future, for us.”\nMillions of Americans upon hearing this interview, which was replayed\non every television outlet, thought this response was both very\nfunny and an indication of how stupid Miss South Carolina was. Most\nadults feel that they know what intelligence looks like and that they\nknow what stupidity looks like. Everyone agreed about the absurdity\nof this response. It was, after all, incoherent, and this was obvious to\nanybody.\nMiss South Carolina was given another chance to answer the\nquestion on the Today Show on NBC, some days later. Here is a\ndescription of what happened from the MSNBC website:\nShe explained Tuesday that she was so overwhelmed by the\nmoment she barely heard any of the question.\n“Everything did come at me at once,” she said. “And I made\na mistake—everybody makes a mistake—I’m human. Right when\nthe question was asked of me, I was in shock . . . I would love to\nre-answer that question.”\nCurry [of the Today show] obliged, reading the entire\nquestion as it had been asked during the pageant. This time,\nUpton [Miss South Carolina] was ready.\n“Personally, my friends and I, we know exactly where the\nUnited States is on a map,” she said. “I don’t know anyone else\nwho doesn’t. If the statistics are correct, I believe there should\nbe more emphasis on geography in our education so people will\nlearn how to read maps better.”\nShe came back later in the show to deliver a flawless\nexplanation of lunar eclipses.\nHeld up on the Internet as the quintessential dumb blonde,\nUpton was an honor student in high school.\nDefining Intelligence 139\nThe premise here is that she isn’t actually stupid but was just confused\nby the moment and that she is intelligent because she is on the\nhonor roll at school, can explain lunar eclipses, and could answer the\noriginal question coherently, given sufficient time to do it (and maybe\nwith some help).\nThe media, for reasons of their own, decided to make this a feelgood\nstory and get people to feel better about Miss South Carolina.\nShe has continued to work in the media in various ways since the\noriginal interview.\nI am not concerned here with Miss South Carolina’s intelligence,\nbut with what it means to be seen as being intelligent. My premise is\nthat while native intelligence is certainly genetic, the perception of\nintelligence and what might be described as intelligent behavior can\nbe altered. (Perhaps this seems as incoherent a position as Miss South\nCarolina’s position on education.)\nThe curious thing about her second response is that it doesn’t\nanswer the original question at all. The question was about why she\nthought Americans were ignorant about geography, and she responded\nby saying that they weren’t but that maybe there should be more\neducation about reading maps, which in no way addresses the question\nabout why Americans can’t locate the United States on a map.\nSo her answer is still awful even after she was given time to work\non it. It is simply unintelligent.\nThe question is: Could we make Miss South Carolina more intelligent\nsomehow? Clearly school hasn’t done it. (She was an honor\nstudent!) How might one do it?\nOf course, we really aren’t concerned with Miss South Carolina\nin particular. Consider the following interviews conducted at a Sarah\nPalin book signing in November 2009, in Columbus, Ohio. The\ninterviewees were all in line waiting to meet Sarah Palin and to buy\nher book:\nInterviewer: Tell us why you are here today.\nOlder woman: She stands for what America is.\nInterviewer: What do you mean by that?\nOlder woman: Freedom, liberty, right to speak . . .\nInterviewer: What are the particular issues you would like to see\nher bring to office?\nOlder woman: Oh, geez, help me out here, guys.\nSecond woman: Fairness. Realness.\n140 Teaching Minds\nSo we have a Palin supporter who has no idea why she supports Palin\nand asks for help. The “helper” says fairness and realness, which apart\nfrom being ungrammatical is also nonsense. Neither supporter seems\nto know much about Palin, but they are eager to meet her and they believe\nin her. (This is not a comment about Sarah Palin, at least not by\nme. Supporters of most political candidates have difficulty explaining\nwhy they like whomever they like. Or, alternatively, they can explain\nit and those explanations leave you wondering.)\nI will never forget attending a JFK campaign visit to Brooklyn\nwhen I was 14. The woman next to me exclaimed that she would vote\nfor JFK because he was so gorgeous. I was appalled. I knew the woman.\nShe was not a deep thinker, but, really–people vote for someone because\nof their looks? Yes, people do, political scientists have pointed\nthis out consistently.\nIs this intelligent behavior? Of course not.\nThe question is: Can we do something about it? Is this an aspect\nof intelligence that is not genetic and that therefore can be changed?\nIf you know and believe that what you have just said makes no\nsense, you can try to learn how to make sense. Do these people know\nthat are they are not making sense? Here is another person from that\nsame Columbus event:\nYoung man in Ohio State jacket: She’s the epitome of\nconservativeness and I’m telling you if the Republican Party\ndoesn’t back her, it doesn’t matter because she’s going to get\nthe presidency.\nInterviewer: What would you like to see her do with foreign\npolicy?\nYoung man in Ohio State jacket: To be honest with you I don’t\nknow anything about her foreign policy.\nInterviewer: What are some of the problems you have with cap\nand trade proposed by Democrats in office?\nYoung man in Ohio State jacket: You want to give away your own\nmoney, it’s fine, but don’t tell me to give away my money. It’s\nsocialism.\nYoung man in Ohio State jacket: The state that she did govern\nwas right across the street from Russia. You know so I’m not\nsaying that she ever had to deal with Russia but I’m sure she\nDefining Intelligence 141\nhad boundary issues she had to deal with. We have boundary\nissues right now with Mexico now.\nThis Palin supporter is also incoherent but incoherent in a different\nway. He doesn’t know much, and he knows he doesn’t know\nmuch. But he has beliefs and he believes in his beliefs. He has beliefs\nabout socialism (that it is bad, and that President Obama thinks it\nis good) that are based on no real knowledge. He has beliefs about\nforeign policy and what it means to have foreign policy experience\nthat are based on nonsense. And he has made up some beliefs about\n“boundaries.”\nWhat does this tell us? It tells us that at some point, maybe not\nnow because he is too set in his own beliefs, someone could have\ntaught him about socialism or “boundaries” or what it means to have\nforeign policy experience. But it should be clear that this is exactly\nthe kind of education that we have been trying to do in our schools\nforever. You can talk about socialism in school, but that doesn’t mean\nthat your average person learns much from what is said there.\nThere is a wonderful movie called Ferris Bueller’s Day Off that\nreveals a great deal about education. I often use a clip from that movie,\nwhen I give speeches on education or training, wherein the teacher\ndrones on about the Smoot Hawley tariff and George Bush’s view of\nReagan’s voodoo economics (as stated in the 1980 primaries) while\nthe students doze off. At a different point in the same movie, the lead\ncharacter blows off a European history test, saying:\nIt’s on European socialism. I mean, really! What’s the point? I’m\nnot European . . . I don’t plan on being European. So who gives a\ncrap if they’re socialists? They could be fascist anarchists. . . . It\nstill wouldn’t change the fact that I don’t own a car!\nThey do teach about socialism in school, but no one is listening. If we\ncan’t produce reasonably intelligent voters in our schools, then we\naren’t doing much.\nHere is another Columbus Palin fan:\nInterviewer: What do you think she would bring in terms of\npolicy in office?\n142 Teaching Minds\nYoung woman: Good judgment.\nInterviewer: Any specifics?\nYoung woman: I think she would control the out-of-control\nspending.\nYoung woman: I think she would acknowledge the system of\ngovernment in the United States rather than focus on the\nadministration of czars.\nInterviewer: Yeah, and what is your problem with czars?\nYoung woman: I’m an American and we don’t have czars in\nAmerica.\nHere again, we have a juxtaposition of beliefs based on no actual evidence\nor reality. I don’t know what this woman has heard about czars,\nbut whatever it is, it misses the point. Could we teach this woman to\nbe on point—to say meaningful things based on actual evidence? Not\nnow, I fear, but it is my contention that we could have done so at some\npoint in her life. School has failed her and she seems, to anyone listening,\nto be stupid. But she is not really stupid; she is just talking stupidly\nbecause she hasn’t been challenged to behave in any other way.\nHere is another:\nMiddle-aged woman: Governor of Alaska is the only one that has\ntop security.\nInterviewer: What does that mean?\nMiddle-aged woman: It means that if anything happens to our\nborders on that side, she’s the first one in line for attack for\nthere.\nThis person not only makes no sense, but she can’t speak in an understandable\nway. Is that genetic? I doubt it. Intelligence, as it is popularly\ndefined, includes the ability to produce coherent speech, which certainly\ncan be enhanced through teaching, but apparently not by our\nschools as they currently exist.\nHere is one last interview from that event:\nInterviewer: What do you think of foreign policy—what would\nyou like to see her do with foreign policy?\nMan with cap: I don’t know, I really don’t have an answer—I\ndon’t know her well enough. I don’t know what she knows or\ndoesn’t know. I don’t know some stuff of what people ask me.\nDefining Intelligence 143\nInterviewer: Some of the viewers think there’s not enough oil.\nMan with cap: We got us self-sufficient energy gas oil right\nunder our feet. Why aren’t we exploring more for it and\ndrilling here instead of sending all that money overseas and\nexporting, I mean importing, all that oil back to America?\nInterviewer: Do you hope she runs for president in 2012?\nMan with cap: Yes, I do.\nInterviewer: You will support her?\nMan with cap: I sure would.\nInterviewer: Do you think there will be any problems supporting\nher, knowing that you’re unfamiliar with her foreign policy\nissues?\nMan with cap: That wouldn’t keep me from not voting for her.\nThere is a difference between ignorance and stupidity, just as there is a\ndifference between knowledge and intelligence. It is a good guess that\nthe “man with cap” above is both stupid and ignorant. The question\nis why?\nOne reason is that it is now acceptable in our society to be ignorant\nand stupid. Here is some of the famous ABC/Charles Gibson interview\nwith Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential campaign:\nGibson: Do you agree with the Bush doctrine?\nPalin: In what respect, Charlie?\nGibson: The Bush—well, what do you—what do you interpret it\nto be?\nPalin: His worldview.\nGibson: No, the Bush doctrine, enunciated September 2002,\nbefore the Iraq war.\nPalin: I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do\nis rid this world of Islamic extremism, terrorists who are\nhellbent on destroying our nation. There have been blunders\nalong the way, though. There have been mistakes made.\nAnd with new leadership, and that’s the beauty of American\nelections, of course, and democracy, is with new leadership\ncomes opportunity to do things better.\nGibson: The Bush doctrine, as I understand it, is that we have the\nright of anticipatory self-defense, that we have the right to a\npreemptive strike against any other country that we think is\ngoing to attack us. Do you agree with that?\n144 Teaching Minds\nPalin: Charlie, if there is legitimate and enough intelligence that\ntells us that a strike is imminent against American people, we\nhave every right to defend our country. In fact, the president\nhas the obligation, the duty to defend.\nI suppose it is not a crime to not know the doctrine of the sitting\npresident from your own party when you are running for vice president,\nbut it does seem odd. But what is worse, is that after being told\nwhat that doctrine is, Palin is content to ramble on incoherently.\nWhy doesn’t this bother her? Clearly this is not a real issue because it\ndoesn’t bother her supporters either.\nHere is some more from that interview:\nGibson: But this is not just reforming a government. This is also\nrunning a government on the huge international stage in\na very dangerous world. When I asked John McCain about\nyour national security credentials, he cited the fact that you\nhave commanded the Alaskan National Guard and that\nAlaska is close to Russia. Are those sufficient credentials?\nPalin: But it is about reform of government and it’s about putting\ngovernment back on the side of the people, and that has\nmuch to do with foreign policy and national security issues.\nLet me speak specifically about a credential that I do bring to\nthis table, Charlie, and that’s with the energy independence\nthat I’ve been working on for these years as the governor\nof this state that produces nearly 20% of the U.S. domestic\nsupply of energy, that I worked on as chairman of the Alaska\nOil and Gas Conservation Commission, overseeing the oil\nand gas development in our state to produce more for the\nUnited States.\nGibson: I know. I’m just saying that national security is a whole\nlot more than energy.\nKnowledge should matter for high government officials, but it doesn’t\nmatter precisely because the people who are listening have no knowledge\neither. Is Sarah Palin intelligent? There are plenty who would\nsay that she is not. These include those who rank coherent thinking\nand the ability to create coherent explanations high on their list of\nwhat constitutes intelligence. But, it should be clear, that is not what\nDefining Intelligence 145\ngenerally is thought of as intelligence. IQ tests have been measuring\nintelligence for decades with questions like these:\nAt the end of a banquet 10 people shake hands with each other.\nHow many handshakes will there be in total?\nA. 100\nB. 20\nC. 45\nD. 50\nE. 90\nThe day before the day before yesterday is three days after\nSaturday. What day is it today?\nA. Monday\nB. Tuesday\nC. Wednesday\nD. Thursday\nE. Friday\nWhich number should come next in the series 1, 3, 6, 10, 15?\nA. 8\nB. 11\nC. 24\nD. 21\nE. 27\nLibrary is to book as book is to\nA. page\nB. copy\nC. binding\nD. cover\nIt is a reasonable guess that neither Palin nor her supporters would do\nreally well on questions like these. But the real issue is why questions\nlike these were chosen to be on IQ tests in the first place. Certainly\nour concept of intelligence, and how to measure it, depends on some\nvague sense of mathematical reasoning ability rather than real-life\nsituation reasoning ability.\n146 Teaching Minds\nThe schools make the same distinction. They do not seriously debate\nforeign policy in high school, but they do teach how to do number\nsequences. There might be those who would say that Palin and\nher supporters probably didn’t do well on the math SAT either. But\nto me this is just a nonsensical way to look at intelligence. Plenty of\nsmart people don’t do well in, nor do they care about, math. But smart\npeople do well in reasoning logically from evidence and in presenting\na coherent argument for their beliefs. This is the essence of what it\nmeans to be smart and to be educated. We expect leaders to be coherent\nin what they say and to be able to justify their beliefs and actions.\nOne can assume that those who are bad at number sequences present\nno problem for the country in any way, but being bad at detecting\nfaulty reasoning has its consequences in a democracy.\nHere is a bit from the Katie Couric interview with Sarah Palin that\nwas shown on CBS during the 2008 campaign:\nCouric: Why, in your view, is Roe v. Wade a bad decision?\nPalin: I think it should be a states’ issue not a federal\ngovernment-mandated, mandating yes or no on such an\nimportant issue. I’m, in that sense, a federalist, where I\nbelieve that states should have more say in the laws of their\nlands and individual areas. Now, foundationally, also, though\nit’s no secret that I’m pro-life, that I believe in a culture of life\nis very important for this country. Personally that’s what I\nwould like to see, um, further embraced by America.\nCouric: Do you think there’s an inherent right to privacy in the\nConstitution?\nPalin: I do. Yeah, I do.\nCouric: The cornerstone of Roe v. Wade.\nPalin: I do. And I believe that individual states can best handle\nwhat the people within the different constituencies in the 50\nstates would like to see their will ushered in an issue like that.\nCouric: What other Supreme Court decisions do you disagree\nwith?\nPalin: Well, let’s see. There’s, of course in the great history of\nAmerica there have been rulings, that’s never going to be\nabsolute consensus by every American. And there are those\nissues, again, like Roe v. Wade, where I believe are best held on\na state level and addressed there. So, you know, going through\nthe history of America, there would be others but . . .\nDefining Intelligence 147\nCouric: Can you think of any?\nPalin: Well, I could think of . . . any again, that could be best\ndealt with on a more local level. Maybe I would take issue\nwith. But, you know, as mayor, and then as governor\nand even as a vice president, if I’m so privileged to serve,\nwouldn’t be in a position of changing those things but in\nsupporting the law of the land as it reads today.\nSo little of what Palin says makes sense that this interview was seen as a\nnational embarrassment, provoking multiple explanations for it from\nthe Palin camp, none of which said: She is just stupid and ignorant.\nObviously that is what her detractors were thinking. But is it true?\nIs she stupid and ignorant? How can we find out? Look at this next\npiece of the Couric interview:\nCouric: . . . people have questioned your readiness since that\ninterview. And I’m curious to hear your reaction.\nPalin: Well, not only am I ready but willing and able to serve as\nvice president with Senator McCain if Americans so bless us\nand privilege us with the opportunity of serving them, ready\nwith my executive experience as a city mayor and manager,\nas a governor, as a commissioner, a regulator of oil and gas,\nnot only with my résumé proving that readiness, but I think\nthe important thing here is that John McCain and I, we share\na vision for America that includes energy independence.\nWhat could be clearer than the idea that she is simply out of her\nleague and that it was a foolish idea to promote her as a possible vice\npresident? Why cynical politicians decide this is OK to do is not my\nproblem. The question I want to address is what makes one intelligent,\napart from genetics.\nLooking at what we have seen here, we can think about our 12\ncognitive processes one more time. Which of them are critical to the\neveryday assessment of the intelligence of another person that most\npeople do on a daily basis?\nLet’s start by eliminating some. Being able to evaluate something,\nor having a set of values you believe in, has very little to do with basic\nintelligence. The samples of stupidity that I cite above do not indicate\nthat any of this ability—determining what is important—is missing in\nthe people being interviewed.\n148 Teaching Minds\nSimilarly, these people probably can influence one another, work\nin teams, and negotiate with one another to some extent. They may\nnot be great at it, but we wouldn’t characterize the ability to influence\nothers well as a sign of intelligence. Many world leaders are very influential\nbut not all of those are considered to be brilliant.\nSimilarly, the ability to be a good team player is no way considered\nto be a sign of intelligence. Some very bright people have difficulty\nworking with others. These things are not signs of intelligence.\nModeling and experimentation ability aren’t really important\nwhen we talk about intelligence. Experimentation is something scientists\ndo. Children and chefs and nonscientists do it as well, of course.\nBut we wouldn’t criticize these interviewees if it turned out that they\ndidn’t know how to experiment. We certainly have no idea from these\ninterviews whether they can experiment or not. We can guess that\nthey cannot. We tend to think that experimentation is the province\nof brilliant people, but would we say that someone is unintelligent\nbecause they don’t know how to conduct a real experiment? Or, that\na chef is brilliant because he takes risks with food? (We may say that\nhe is a brilliant chef, but that doesn’t mean we think he is brilliant.)\nExperimentation has a lot to do with innovation, which is certainly\nrelated to intelligence, but, again, it really is not what we think about\nwhen we hear interviews and think that the people being interviewed\nare stupid.\nSimilarly, we don’t know whether these folks can effectively create\na model of the world. It seems a good guess that they cannot, but, yet\nagain, this lies more within the province of science and very intelligent\nthinking than within our everyday definition of intelligence.\nSome very smart people have weird models of the world or no model\nof certain aspects of the world.\nWe do not think that the interviewees are stupid because they\ndon’t conduct experiments or create elaborate world models.\nBut a different story emerges when we look at the rest of the cognitive\nprocesses. Which of the remaining processes are clearly missing in\nthe answers supplied by the interviewees above?\nObviously these people don’t speak particularly well.\nBeing able to aptly describe your views, or describe a situation you\nhave been in, or a thought you have had, is a hallmark of intelligence.\nWe judge people’s intelligence, at least in part, by how well they\nspeak.\nDefining Intelligence 149\nDoes the ability to do diagnosis serve as a hallmark of intelligence?\nCertainly doctors do diagnosis on a daily basis and doctors are\nhighly respected in our society. Most people think that if you are a\ndoctor, then you must be smart, but if you push on this belief, you\nfind that what people actually think is that a doctor had to go to\nschool for a really long time, learn of lot of complicated material, and\nthen work really hard as an intern and then as a resident. People respect\ndoctors and may well think that the doctor is the smartest person\nin their small town, but that is typically because she is likely the\nmost educated person in that town. They easily may not consider her\nto have “common sense,” which is one way that ordinary people describe\ntheir perception of intelligent behavior.\nDiagnosis is done by plumbers, detectives, engineers, and beauty\ncare professionals as well. Diagnosis is a very important cognitive\nprocess to learn. Learning to do it well often means the difference\nbetween success and failure on the job and personally. Can the interviewees\ndo diagnosis? Miss South Carolina can.\nShe asserts that her friends can locate the United States on a map\nof the world. She can find contradictory evidence for the proposition\npresented to her, which is certainly part of diagnosis. The Palin interviewees\nhave done diagnosis as well. They have determined what is\nwrong with the country. They may not have done much more than\nlisten to someone on talk radio, but they came to a conclusion based\non the evidence presented to them.\nBut they have done it badly. That is why they seem stupid.\nComing up with an accurate diagnosis requires intelligence. Everyone\ndoes diagnosis, but we seek counsel from those who do it better\nthan others. Diagnostic ability is a hallmark of intelligence.\nWhat about causation? Let’s consider Miss South Carolina’s revised\nremarks again:\n“Personally, my friends and I, we know exactly where the United\nStates is on a map,” she said. “I don’t know anyone else who\ndoesn’t. If the statistics are correct, I believe there should be more\nemphasis on geography in our education so people will learn\nhow to read maps better.”\nMiss South Carolina thinks “there should be more emphasis on geography\nin our education so people will learn to read maps better.”\n150 Teaching Minds\nIn many ways this remark is as dumb as her early remarks. Why do I\nthink this?\nBecause it makes it clear that she hasn’t a clue, and doesn’t really\ncare, about causation.\nAnd, this is exactly the problem with Sarah Palin’s remarks to\nKatie Couric as well:\nCouric: . . . people have questioned your readiness since that\ninterview. And I’m curious to hear your reaction.\nPalin: Well, not only am I ready but willing and able to serve as\nvice president with Senator McCain if Americans so bless us\nand privilege us with the opportunity of serving them, ready\nwith my executive experience as a city mayor and manager,\nas a governor, as a commissioner, a regulator of oil and gas,\nnot only with my résumé proving that readiness, but I think\nthe important thing here is that John McCain and I, we share\na vision for America that includes energy independence.\nWhy do I think that the problem here is about a misunderstanding of\nhow to determine causation? Miss South Carolina has determined the\nfollowing things to be true:\nIf students can’t do something, they should be taught to do it.\nIf students can’t do something, it is because they weren’t taught\nto do it.\nIf students can’t do something that it seems anyone should be\nable to do, then it should be taught in school.\nReading maps is more important than whatever would have to\nbe eliminated from school so that reading maps could take its\nplace.\nThese decisions should be made on the basis of statistical\nevidence of student’s abilities.\nBut is any of this reasonable? Not only could one argue with each of\nthese propositions, but it is fair to say that Miss South Carolina herself\ndoesn’t know that she holds these positions, that she hasn’t thought\nabout them, and that she might disagree with what she said if someone\npointed this out to her.\nIn other words, she cannot reason well precisely because her beliefs\nindicate that she does not think about causation, and one can\nDefining Intelligence 151\nguess that she doesn’t think about causation because no one ever tried\nto get her to do so. So she may very well be smart but she sounds\nstupid because she seems to be unaware of her own causal reasoning\nand is not very good at it. Being good at understanding causation\nand figuring what could possibly cause what and why is a hallmark of\nintelligence.\nIntelligence can be enhanced by practicing the cognitive processes\nthat are the basis of intelligent behavior and intelligent reasoning.\nOne of these hallmark processes is certainly causation.\nWe could make Miss South Carolina smarter by teaching her how\nto determine what causes what and asking her to figure things out and\nexplain them to others using a causation model that she could defend.\nOf course, it would have been better if this process started when she\nwas a small child.\nNow, with that in mind, let’s look at the Palin remark. Palin was\nasked about her readiness for the office of vice president, which isn’t\nmuch of an office really. What was really being asked was her readiness\nfor the presidency, which was not unreasonable to worry about\nconsidering John McCain’s age. She responded in a way that made\nclear that she has no understanding of causation either.\nIn the statements above, she asserted (implicitly) the following\nbeliefs about causation:\nAny mayor or city manager is ready to be president.\nAny governor is ready to be president.\nAny commissioner is ready to be president.\nAny regulator of gas and oil is ready to be president.\nIf you have a vision of energy independence, you are ready to be\npresident.\nNow, of course, one of these beliefs is, in fact, shared by the country\nsince we have chosen governors to be president. But the other beliefs\nare simply wrong. No one thinks that having a vision of energy independence\nprepares you to be president or that being an oil and gas\nregulator prepares you to be president.\nSo, what does Palin misunderstand here? She doesn’t get the idea\nof preparedness as causation. Having a degree in accounting prepares\nyou to be an accountant, most would agree. We believe, as a society, in\ncertain rites of passage preparing you for the next step. Palin apparently\nhas never thought about this or why anyone would hold such beliefs.\n152 Teaching Minds\nIt is not an unreasonable question to ask whether being a U.S.\nsenator prepares you to be president. It would not have been odd if\nPalin had asked Couric whether we ever had a president who actually\nwas prepared for the job. Other than vice presidents who work closely\nwith a president for 4 years or more, it is not unreasonable to assert\nthat we have a history of unprepared presidents. But she didn’t say\nthat because preparedness is a causative notion and Palin doesn’t seem\nto get causation. She may be bright enough to have been taught about\ncausation when she was small, but apparently this didn’t happen. As a\nresult, she seems stupid to those who do understand causation.\nPalin recently has made statements that make you wonder where\nher ideas about causation come from. This is from a 2009 interview\non ABC:\nWalters: Now let’s talk about some issues—the Middle East. The\nObama Administration does not want Israel to build any\nmore settlements on what they consider Palestinian territory.\nWhat is your view on this?\nPalin: I disagree with the Obama Administration on that. I\nbelieve that, um, the Jewish settlements should be allowed to\nbe expanded upon because the population of Israel is going\nto grow. More and more Jewish people will be flocking to\nIsrael in the days and weeks and months ahead.\nWhat is the problem here? Again, there is a question of causation, but\nit is more obvious that that is the issue. No one who hears this statement\nwould fail to ask why Jews would be flocking to Israel in the\nweeks and months ahead.\nIt is important to understand that determination of causation is\nthe backbone of an intelligently thought out belief system. People believe\ncertain things. They believe that the sun will rise in the morning\nand that their parents will come home from work at night. Beliefs\noften are based on observation and generalization. People also are\ntaught beliefs. There are many ways to acquire beliefs. Children get\nthem from their parents mostly but also from friends and siblings.\nAt some point, however, reality comes into play. Reality often means\ncomparing a belief with what you know or can figure out about causation.\nYou can believe that the sun rises each morning but not know its\ncause. And, of course, you can learn the cause. You can believe that the\nDefining Intelligence 153\nGreat Pumpkin rises on Halloween if you like, but at some point you\nmight notice that this doesn’t seem to take place.\nBeliefs, reality, and the rules of causation are interrelated but they\nare not the same thing. Causal knowledge should, however, enable\none to alter erroneous beliefs that don’t stand up to what one knows\nabout causation.\nSo what would cause Jews to suddenly flock to Israel? Is she privy\nto information about another Holocaust or is this some fundamentalist\nreligious belief? She doesn’t say. The fact that she doesn’t say, is\nwhat makes her look either unintelligent or incapable of clear reasoning.\nBeing able to justify one’s beliefs by citing common knowledge\nor revealing knowledge known only to you involves relying on commonly\nknown rules about causation.\nWhat about prediction?\nYou can believe that New York will beat Philadelphia in football.\nYou can predict it based on evidence. You can explain the cause and\neffect that have made you come to this point of view. But, after New\nYork loses, you need to modify some beliefs that you previously held.\nAt the very least you have to acknowledge that your prediction was\nwrong and you might want take this into account the next time you\nmake a prediction, by finding out what went wrong in your reasoning,\nif anything. Or, you simply can say your team wasn’t lucky, of course.\nPrediction relies on beliefs, and in many situations predictions are\nor are not verified immediately and new thinking can begin. But when\none gets married, for example, one is predicting that the marriage will\nbe good and will work out well for all parties. One might not realize\nfor some years that this prediction was wrong. Then, when seeking\na new marriage, the predictor hopes she has determined what went\nwrong by seeing what erroneous beliefs were held the last time.\nIt is very good to be able to predict, but predictive ability is not\nseen as a sign of intelligence. After all, people seek out fortune tellers\nbecause they think fortune tellers have a gift, not because they think\nfortune tellers are very bright. At the 2010 Olympics an octopus was\napparently capable of making accurate predictions. No one claimed\nthat it was an especially bright octopus.\nA prediction made by someone that is justified by, “I just feel it,”\nmakes the predictor look foolish. In contrast, a prediction about relativity,\nfor example, that is complex to understand but has been explained\nclearly and later is borne out by evidence makes the predictor\n154 Teaching Minds\nlook like a genius. But what actually makes us feel that a scientist’s\naccurate predictions make him smart is the reasoning behind those\npredictions, the causal explanation.\nWe can see how intelligence, or the lack of it, is perceived by\npeople and we must begin to reconsider how intelligence should be\nmeasured by those trying to put numbers to mental abilities. And, we\ncan see why those Palin supporters seem so dumb. Let’s look at one of\nthem again:\nInterviewer: What do you think she would bring in terms of\npolicy to office?\nYoung woman: Good judgment.\nInterviewer: Any specifics?\nYoung woman: I think she would control the out-of-control\nspending.\nThis is a prediction. The question is what this prediction is based on. It\nis a good guess that the young woman cannot cite examples of Palin’s\ngood judgment and has no idea whether Palin was able to control\nspending in Alaska. If she were able to cite examples, that is, if her\npredictions were supported by evidence that she clearly articulated,\nwe would, in fact, think that the young woman was smart. Perhaps\nshe is smart and perhaps the interviewer deliberately cut out those\nresponses. It seems unlikely, given the weird “czar” remark that followed\nthis, but the point is that we seek such evidence when we make\na judgment about someone’s intelligence.\nWhat about planning? Those who make bad plans are usually\nlaughed at. Criminals who get caught by doing something dumb are\nalways made fun of by the press. Bad planning makes a person look\nstupid.\nBad judgment, on the other hand, is more easily forgiven. When\nyou make a mistake, you can always claim to have used bad judgment.\nMake the same mistake again and you begin to look stupid.\nSo, if we are interested in making people more intelligent, as opposed\nto more knowledgeable, it is clear that we need to redefine what\nwe mean by intelligence.\nIntelligence is the ability to diagnose well, to plan well, and to\nbe able to understand what causes what. To do this one must be able\nto reassess one’s belief system when new evidence is presented and\nDefining Intelligence 155\none must be able to explain one’s reasoning clearly to those who ask.\nAnd, one must have a knowledge base of relevant information to draw\nupon. But our education system, in concentrating only on the knowledge\nbase and not on independent reasoning from that knowledge\nbase, has ensured that the knowledge base remains incomprehensible\nto most people and therefore is immediately forgotten after school is\nover.\nIt would be a good idea to eliminate IQ tests as a measure of intelligence\nand begin to teach people to do diagnosis, to plan well, to be\nable to determine causality, and to clearly explain their reasoning to\nothers.\nThose that cannot learn to do this would rightly be called stupid,\nbut those who can would rightly be called intelligent.\nDegrees of intelligence would be about one’s ability to do this for\nmore and more complex issues in complex domains.\n\nCHAPTER 11\nRestructuring the University\nIt is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.\n—Albert Einstein\nWhen I moved from Stanford to Yale, it was entirely because of the\nefforts of Bob Abelson, a psychology professor who became my good\nfriend and wonderful colleague during the 15 years I was at Yale. Bob\nhad been instrumental in helping to create the Computer Science\nDepartment at Yale, which is the department that wound up recruiting\nme( Bob had hoped I would be outside the department structure\nsince I didn’t really fit in anywhere very well, but he couldn’t win that\nargument.)\nBob told me a story about the creation of the Computer Science\nDepartment at Yale, which involved his having to argue with another\nfaculty member on a university committee about why a department\nshould be created around a machine. He said that one member of the\ncommittee actually asked him whether there should be a department\nof lathe science as well.\nWe both found this to be pretty funny at the time. Now, however,\nI have to admit that the guy had a point.\nI have been a professor in quite a few academic departments in\nmy university career: linguistics, computer science, psychology, education,\nand electrical engineering. These departments all have some\nsomething in common: They have no real reason to exist. One would\nassume that departments represent academic disciplines that are coherent\nin some way, but it simply isn’t so. The people in a computer\nscience department, for example, have in common that they all think\nabout computer-related issues, but so do people in other disciplines.\nSome parts of computer science have more in common with mathematics\nthan they do with other parts of computer science. There were\nmany people in the departments that I was in who worked on things\nthat I didn’t understand or care about. All our interchanges were about\n157\n158 Teaching Minds\ndepartment affairs, never about computer science. We had nothing to\nsay to one another about that. The same is true in every department.\nAcademic departments are made up of faculty who have been thrown\ntogether for historical reasons but really have no business being in the\nsame department.\nWhat does a clinical psychologist have in common with someone\nwho studies animal behavior? Do they talk about crazy chimps? What\ndoes an historical linguist have to say to a Chomskian linguist? What\ndoes someone who works on the philosophy of mind have to say to\nsomeone who studies religious philosophy?\nDepartments probably should have been organized around ideas\ninstead of around words. I tried to facilitate that when I helped create\ncognitive science as a discipline by founding the Journal of Cognitive\nScience and the Cognitive Science Society. That was over 30 years ago\nand while some cognitive science departments have been created, in\nthe end the disciplines that study the mind continue to do so in their\nown ways. Computer scientists who study the mind build computer\nmodels, and psychologists who study the mind run experiments.\nAnthropologists who study the mind do descriptions. That these are\nthree of the twelve cognitive processes is no accident. Departments are\norganized to some extent around the processes that they use, but that\nis by no means the central organizing principle. As that old adversary\nto the creation of the Yale Computer Science Department said, the\ncentral organizing principle was a machine and that is kind of silly.\nWho suffers from this state of affairs? The students, of course.\nWhen a department’s faculty meets to decide what courses students\nmust take in order to major in their field, it is not a sage conversation\namong scholars about what it means to be a computer scientist or psychologist.\nIt is a political tug fest, where people from very diverse fields\nwithin these departments push and shove for turf.\nWhy do they care? There are two big reasons. First, if no one signs\nup for the courses you teach, you won’t be teaching them for long.\nSecond, if many students sign up for the courses you teach, you can\njustify hiring more faculty in your subdiscipline, which means more\nfriends to hang out with and more power in department meetings\nwhere the votes can now go your way. You think this stuff doesn’t\nmatter? These issues are the lifeblood of every university department.\nLet’s look at both of these and see why they might matter.\nRestructuring the University 159\nInstead of subjects then, let’s take a fanciful tour through the\ntwelve cognitive processes and see what would happen to the university\nif it organized itself around those processes.\nFirst let’s look at the existing Yale departments and schools:\nAfrican American Studies\nAnthropology\nApplied Mathematics\nApplied Physics\nArchitecture, School of\nArt, School of\nAstronomy\nBiology\nBiomedical Engineering\nChemical Engineering\nChemistry\nClassics\nComputer Science\nDrama, School of\nEast Asian Languages & Literatures\nEconomics\nElectrical Engineering\nEnglish Language & Literature\nEnvironmental Engineering\nEpidemiology & Public Health\nForestry & Environmental Studies, School of\nFrench\nGeology & Geophysics\nGermanic Languages & Literatures\nHistory\nHistory of Art\nInternational Relations\nItalian\nLaw School\nLinguistics\nMathematics\nMechanical Engineering\nMedicine, School of\n160 Teaching Minds\nMusic, School of\nNear Eastern Languages & Civilizations\nNursing, School of\nPhilosophy\nPhysics\nPolitical Science\nPsychology\nSlavic Languages & Literatures\nSociology\nSpanish\nStatistics\nThis list may be somewhat inaccurate since it is taken from a list of\npossible majors, which is not the same thing as a list of departments.\nI just edited it to reflect my memory of Yale, which could conceivably\nhave added a new department or two since I was there 20 years ago\n(but departments are not easily created or deleted at Yale).\nNow let’s ask what would happen if we reorganized.\nWhich departments specialize in prediction, for example? Clearly,\neconomics is about prediction, as is physics, and sociology, and psychology,\nand any branch of engineering.\nWhich departments specialize in judgment? Law does certainly.\nMedicine, parts of psychology, parts of anthropology, aspects of statistics,\narchitecture, and art history do so, as do many others.\nWhich departments specialize in modeling? Computer science\ncertainly does, as do parts of psychology. Engineering disciplines do\nand nearly all of the sciences do. Economics and sociology do as well.\nWhich departments specialize in experimentation? All of the sciences,\nplus psychology, do experiments. Economics and sociology\npeople sometimes do them. Political scientists do experiments.\nWhich departments specialize in describing? The humanities specialize\nin this, as do English and Italian, and Near Eastern languages,\nand linguistics, and anthropology. Parts of psychology and medicine\nand law do as well.\nWhere is diagnosis practiced? In medicine, of course, but also in\nlaw, business, and engineering.\nWhere is planning studied and practiced? In engineering and in\narchitecture certainly, but also in business, medicine, computer science,\nand psychology.\nRestructuring the University 161\nWhere is causation worried about? Nearly everywhere. Anyone\nin the social sciences or in any practical discipline worries about\ncausation.\nSo, should departments be organized around the twelve cognitive\nprocesses? Probably not.\nIt would be difficult to do and everyone would be against it. It\nis difficult to change what has always been in place. But those who\nstudy diagnosis would benefit from being around others who were\ndoing diagnosis all the time. And those who are worried about descriptions\nwould do well to hang around others doing the same. But\nit doesn’t matter that much, really. In a research university, professors\nreally just talk with people who are doing more or less exactly what\nthey themselves are doing. Departmental seminars are social gatherings\nmore than intellectual meeting places, since a talk on one subspecialty\nrarely interests those who work in different subspecialties in the\nsame department.\nBut none of this really matters. Our research universities (of which\nthere are maybe 50 in the United States) are doing very well, and my\nproblem is not with them. It is with the institutions that claim to be\neducating our youth for the future and that employ professors who\nhave a Ph.D. from a research university and who really wish they were\nstill there. The research universities serve as professor training grounds\nthat train many more professors who can do research than we possibly\ncould need. These people then become professors at institutions\nwhere hardly any student intends to get a Ph.D., but they continue to\nteach the same Ph.D. training curriculum that they studied.\nThis has got to stop. The problem is not so much the universities\nas the high schools, of course. As long as college is seen as a professor\ntraining ground, then high school is seen as way to get into the professor\ntraining ground, and a nonsensical system evolves that trains high\nschool kids to study what professors need to know. This has to end.\nWhen students sign up for psychology at their university, they\nwant to know what is wrong with them and their parents, and instead\nthey study how to do experiments because that is what their professors\nlearned to do in graduate school. When students take computer\nscience in college, they want to learn to use the computer, but instead\nthey study the mathematics of computation because that is what their\nprofessor does. When kids study chemistry in college, they are doing\nit in order to become doctors for the most part, but instead of learning\n162 Teaching Minds\nchemistry that doctors need to know, they study the chemistry research\nthat their professors are doing. When they want to learn business,\nthey learn economics. When they want to learn how to write,\nthey learn about literature. All of this happens because of the nature of\nthe research universities’ domination of our education system.\nIn order to fix our high schools, we need to get rid of departments\nbased on rather arbitrarily defined academic subjects.. We should organize\nuniversities around the kinds of work people do, where work\nmeans the kinds of thinking that they engage in, not the machines\nthat they play with. Anyway that’s my suggestion.\nAN IMAGINED FIRST YEAR IN COLLEGE\nWe all know that what I propose will never happen. University faculty\nwould stop such a proposal at every turn. So, in the name of reality,\nI want to make a suggestion that university faculty possibly could\nadopt.\nSimply divide the 4 years that make up college into two parts.\nDedicate the first 2 years to the teaching of the 12 processes and the\nlast 2 to the study of the subjects that the faculty so dearly love. Introduction\nto X, which now dominates the first 2 years of college for most\nstudents, would be abandoned. The faculty hate teaching it anyway\nand the students hate taking it.\nHow would this work? Let’s first consider the set of processes\ngrouped under conceptual processes.\nConceptual Processes\nPrediction is an area of life that is worth getting good at doing.\nWho, in the various faculties, organize their daily lives around predictions?\nEconomists make predictions. It is what they do all the time.\nMedical doctors make predictions. Physicists make predictions. Political\nscientists make predictions. Let’s imagine that students were\ntaught by a team of people from these four areas who were the exactly\nthose people who specialized in making predictions all the time in\ntheir careers. And, let’s suppose that they created a year-long course\nin how to make predictions based on known evidence, past cases, and\nRestructuring the University 163\npushing the boundaries of what is known. Wouldn’t this be a better\ncourse than Introduction to Physics? The teachers could introduce\nwhatever aspects of physics they wanted to help students understand\nthe predictive process in that area, but other faculty who did prediction\nin other areas would be part of the discussion. There would be a\nset of interesting issues ranging from predictions that were thought\nto be right but weren’t, to predictions that are being made today in\neach area. The content would be the predictive process itself, not the\ntraditional subject matter. Statistics (and other useful tools) would be\ntaught in this context while the predictive process was being studied.\nModeling. Who build models? Psychologists think about models of\nthe mind, as do computer scientists and philosophers who specialize\nin thinking about thinking. Architects and economists build models\nof a different sort. Engineers work with models regularly. All of these\npeople use different modeling tools but they work on the same thing:\ntrying to figure out how something works by building it and seeing if\nthey can replicate it. They may be using a computer or building blocks\nor electricity or art. It makes no difference. It is all an attempt to see\nhow things work by building some facsimile. This is an important idea\nin human thinking, and a course should be taught to undergraduates\non how to do it by the people who actually do it, teaching different\ntechniques as they go. They are many ways to build a model, and\nstudents in college should know the possibilities before they take on\nfurther study.\nExperimentation. Psychologists do experiments. Chemists do\nexperiments. Physicists do experiments. Medical researchers do\nexperiments. (The drug companies are constantly doing experiments\nthat affect us all.) Why is there no course in learning how to do an\nexperiment? Shouldn’t students be learning how to come up with a\nhypothesis and how to test that hypothesis? Isn’t that more important\nas a fundamental building block of the mind than any course offered\nto freshmen in college today?\nEvaluation. Every academic field does evaluation. In every\ndiscipline there are ways and means to discuss and evaluate the\nworth of papers and research and practical proposals. Businesses are\n164 Teaching Minds\nevaluated regularly and evaluation is taught explicitly in business\nschool. Political scientists evaluate politicians and political systems.\nHistorians evaluate what makes governments, battles, cities, and a\nrange of other things successful. Architects and urban planners and\nengineers worry about evaluation of what they propose and produce.\nAll of these people could combine to teach students how to evaluate.\nThis is very important part of functioning in any society.\nFirst College Year Summary\nIt would be my contention that a freshman year made up of these\nfour processes, taught in four simultaneous courses that were designed\nto relate to one another in various ways and at specific times, would be\na wonderful thing for teaching people how to think. The best of our\nfaculty could teach what they thought about to students, who now\nwould be ready to start to think rigorously. By the end of this first year,\nstudents could begin to specialize, not in academic subjects just yet,\nbut in other processes that build on the conceptual processes.\nSECOND YEAR IN COLLEGE\nLet’s look at the analytic processes.\nAnalytic Processes\nDiagnosis. Who does diagnosis? Doctors certainly. Lawyers certainly.\nAll the people I mentioned above who are building models\nneed to figure out why their models may have gone wrong. Anyone\nwho manages people or large operations needs to figure out all the\ntime what has gone wrong. In fact, diagnosis is a critical part of nearly\nevery area of thinking and every area of work. Diagnosis needs to be\nstudied for its own sake. How do we do diagnosis in principle, no matter\nwhat the situation?\nDiagnosis also needs to be examined in the various contexts in\nwhich it can be applied. A course in diagnosis, taught by the entire faculty\nwho do diagnosis regularly, showing real work and real situations\nthat they have had to handle, and coming after the first year, would\nhave two advantages. One, it could build on the basic conceptual\nRestructuring the University 165\nprocesses discussed above. Second, students could choose to think\nabout diagnosis in some areas as opposed to others. Art experts might\nteach about art fraud, and lawyers might teach about detecting business\nfraud. In each case there would be similarities, and these should\nbe taught by a group of faculty from different areas, but at the end\nof the course students should be able to start to actually do diagnosis\nunder the tutelage of an expert in an area that interests them.\nThey actually may not know much about that area of knowledge,\nof course, and that would be the objection of the faculty to this idea.\nBut it is my contention that faculty have had this wrong all these\nyears. Teaching the basics to students, who have no concept of their\npossible use, is really not helpful. All these introductory courses are\njust an excuse to pack kids into lecture halls and pretend to do education\nwhile saving money on hiring more teachers. Teachers should\npose real-world problems to students and encourage students to gain\nthe knowledge they need to solve them.\nDiagnosis is a perfect area for this. One can try one’s hand at\ncrime detection, without knowing everything about the details of\nhow one does it, with the help of an expert looking over one’s shoulder.\nThis kind of just-in-time learning is how humans have always\nlearned what they needed to know. The idea that school should teach\nyou what you need to know before you need to know it, is seriously\nflawed. People can’t remember what they learned, years after they\nlearned it in school, if they haven’t been practicing what they learned\nall along.\nJudgment. Law typically is not part of any college curriculum\nbecause law schools are recent inventions on college campuses (that is,\nthey are from the past century and not the century before) so law never\ngot to be part of the required or even elective set of college courses\ndespite the fact that so many students want to be lawyers. Judges make\njudgments all the time, and those lawyers who teach judges to make\njudgments should be teaching freshmen to make judgments as well.\nOf course, artists and musicians and literary critics make judgments\nof a different sort, as do philosophers and businesspeople. All of these\npeople could be teaching a course together on how to make judgments\nfairly and how to determine what is fair. This is where ethics and\nmorality come into play as well.\n166 Teaching Minds\nPlanning. What I said about diagnosis is also true of planning. We\nplan in everything we do. There are economic plans, architectural\nplans, medical treatment plans, business plans, and so on. A computer\nprogram is a type of plan, and research plans are everywhere in a\nuniversity. Writing these plans is not so different in principle, but in\nreality a business plan doesn’t look much like a treatment plan. So\nthere is the idea of a good plan and the understanding of what a plan\nlooks like, what a plan’s description ought to be like, in any area of\nlife. You may think a business plan should look a certain way, but if\nthe business community has a different idea, that idea will turn out\nto be right.\nStudents should have the opportunity to write all kinds of plans,\nlearning about the principles of planning while learning about what\nofficially is considered to be a good plan in an area of the real world\nthat interests them.\nSo, as part of the second year, students should get to study planning,\nand then study successful planning documents, and then write\nplans and have them evaluated by the faculty.\nCausation. Who studies causation? Everybody. Psychologists\nworry about what makes people crazy, doctors worry about what\nmakes people sick, environmentalists worry about what is ruining\nthe planet. Physicists want to know how the world works. Computer\nscientists want to know how computers can work better. Engineers do\nnothing but causation, really. So, here again, determining causes is a\nbasic cognitive skill and it can be learned within the second year as\nwell, in the same way I have been describing building on what came\nin the first year to tackle complex problems of causation in areas that\ninterest the students.\nSocial Processes\nDescribing can easily be taught, as all of the eight processes discussed\nabove are taught by requiring students to present their work in\nwritten and oral form. Students need to learn to write but they also\nneed to learn to talk and to use alternative media to make their points\nand to explain what they have done. A coherent course of study in\nhow to describe properly is easily within the ability of any college faculty\nand ought to be its highest priority, taught from many different\nRestructuring the University 167\npoints of view, teaching what description is about not how to work\nPowerPoint.\nTHIRD YEAR IN COLLEGE AND BEYOND\nNow what next?\nAfter these 2 years, what will students be able to do and what\nshould the faculty do with them? Clearly, faculty, as I have pointed\nout, want to teach what interests them—their own research subspecialties.\nFaculty will want to continue to insist on there being majors.\nStudents should not have to be forced to select a major subject because\nmajors (and, of course, subjects) are at the root of the problem.\nWhose needs do majors satisfy? Faculty like them because the faculty\ncan determine that to be a major in X students must know all\nof its aspects, and then insist that students, take obscure courses that\nthey would not want to take. This is another way of making sure that\nfaculty get to teach whatever they want to teach.\nAn alternative would be to let students specialize in a cognitive\nprocess, like diagnosis, and an area where they have become knowledgeable\nto which diagnosis applies, like financial diagnosis or behavioral\ndiagnosis. Every student who majors in business doesn’t really\nwant to, or need to, know every aspect of business, and a student who\nmajors in psychology doesn’t need to study clinical, social, animal,\nand developmental psychology, if what he is interested in is diagnosing\npersonality disorders, for example.\nLet students specialize, if they want—they shouldn’t be made to,\nbut let them specialize in processes that they might want to become\nproficient at. We shouldn’t force them to take courses , that in no\nway serve their interests. Such requirements are made using arguments\nabout breadth when they are there to make sure that undersubscribed\ncourses get taught. Majors in computer science at Yale when I\narrived there had to take artificial intelligence and numerical analysis.\nThese subjects never interest the same people. They are as different as\naccounting and clinical psychology. These requirements were there\nbecause faculty wanted to make sure there were students enrolled in\ntheir course. If they didn’t, they would have had to teach something\nthey didn’t know as well. Faculty made arguments about the wellrounded\nstudent, but students’ needs had nothing to do with it.\n168 Teaching Minds\nWhenever you see a required course in a departmental major,\nthere is politics behind it. Someone has traded with someone else. If\nyou make them take my course, then I will vote to make them take\nyour course. It is how requirements are created at every school. No one\nis thinking of the students’ needs, trust me.\nSo what if we did think of the students’ needs? What would we do\nin the third and fourth years of college? It seems obvious that students\nwould like to learn some job skills and that they would like to be able\nto pick subjects that interested them for further study. In addition,\nthey might have found something that they were working on in the\nfirst 2 years that made them want to get better at it. This is what the\nrest of college should look like then.\nFor computer science, for example, students should get to select\nsoftware engineering, as suggested by my colleague earlier, if they\nwant to be employable, and they should be able to improve cognitive\nskills that they may have acquired in the first 2 years. They may\nnot have studied various subspecialties in computer science, so they\nshould get to choose the ones that interest them. They also may have\nan interest in pursuing some noncomputer-related subjects taught at\nthe university, for their own edification. In other words, they get to\nchoose and the choices should include job skills and continued use of\nthe cognitive processes they have honed in the first 2 years. Faculty\nsimply should offer choices, and students should pick.\nWhat would happen if this were done?\nIn a world where students got to decide what they studied, many\nof the departments listed above would disappear. There might be some\ncall for Near Eastern languages or art history, but not that much. These\ndepartments exist for historical reasons and universities are reluctant\nto get rid of them, so universities make requirements that students\ntake courses in them. An enormous English department is justified\nonly by the sense that universities ought to have that sort of thing and\nby continuing English literature requirements for students. Without\nthat, such departments would be much smaller than they are.\nTherefore, it is clear that this cannot happen.\nWhat could happen is this: High schools could change and colleges\nwould have to adapt. This is possible because high school does\nnot have to be the way it is today. Its current organization around\nacademic subjects makes no sense. This can be fixed by simply building\ndifferent kinds of high school curricula. But how can we change\nhigh school?\nRestructuring the University 169\nAs it stands now, we can’t. High schools teach what colleges tell\nthem to teach. Recently I was looking for a picture of the man who\nwas principal of my elementary school many years ago. I wanted to\nput it in a speech I was about to give. So, I went to the P.S. 247 (Brooklyn)\nwebsite and discovered that it is now a “New York City College\nPartnership Elementary School.” When I finished laughing, I started\nto wonder when this “everyone must spend their entire childhood\nworrying about getting into college” nonsense would end. P.S. 247\nwas not a great bastion of learning or a fun place in the 1950s, and I\ncan only imagine how awful it is now. I wondered why P.S. 247 now\nhad to be a college prep elementary school. A commenter on what I\nwrote noted that the old trade schools, which used to dominate the\nNew York school system, were serving mostly minority populations\nand this had to stop; so now “everyone can go to college” is the mantra\nof the equity folks.\nBut the problem is, of course, that what is being bought with all\nthis college preparation is the right to be an unemployed English major\ninstead of the airplane mechanic you might have been if you had\ngone to Aviation High School.\nHigh school has become all about college, and college is all about\nscholarship and research, so what is left? So who teaches students to\nthink clearly? Who teaches students about the possibilities there are\nfor work that might interest them? Who teaches students how to get\nalong with one another, and who teaches people how to communicate\nwell?\nCertainly not the high schools, which are obsessed with test score\npreparation, which means rote memory for the most part.\nCertainly not the colleges, which are run by faculty who do research\nand who think mostly about that.\nOne possible answer is community colleges, but when someone\nlike me suggests that skipping college and going to community college\ninstead to learn an actual skill might be a good idea for most students,\nthat suggestion is disregarded as being on the lunatic fringe.\nThe good news is that because of all this craziness, there is a big\nopportunity to build an alternative, which I will discuss in Chapter 14.\n\nCHAPTER 12\nHow Not to Teach\nSome people will never learn anything, for this reason, because\nthey understand everything too soon.\n—Alexander Pope\nMy daughter learned a lot from me and from her surroundings when\nshe was small. All children learn all the time when they are little.\nBut what are they learning? When Hana was about 1-1/2 we lived in\nSwitzerland. Hana was my parent’s first grandchild. Since they were in\nNew York, there were frequent phone calls back and forth and more\nthan the occasional visit. Once during this period I got curious as\nto whether Hana knew the names of her grandparents. I figured she\nmight not know the word name so I asked her, “What does Gammy\n(her name for my mother) call Poppy (my father). She immediately\nresponded, “Maaacc!!” imitating the intonation and exasperation of\nmy mother trying to get my father’s attention. I asked what my father\ncalled my mother, and she said “Marge!” in the tone of an authoritative\nmilitary call.\nHana talked to her grandparents on the phone quite a bit. One day\nI noticed her walking in furious circles while she was talking, at one\npoint almost bringing the phone down on her head. Now who had\nbeen teaching her that? Well . . . me. That’s what I do when I talk on\nthe phone. And it is still what my daughter does, 30 years later.\nSpeaking of 30 years later (well, 20 in this story), I observed this\nsame seemingly imitative behavior in Hana when she was in college.\nI remarked to a friend of my daughter who went to school with her in\nEvanston that there was a no left turn sign in Evanston (where I also\nworked) that I always ignored because it was so stupid. She said that\nmy daughter always ignored the same sign and also said it was stupid.\nThe curious part of this story is that my daughter and I, having our\nown cars and lives, had never been in a car together in Evanston and\nneither had we ever discussed this sign.\n171\n172 Teaching Minds\nDid I teach her to ignore stupid no left turn signs? Of course I\ndid. But I never said such a thing to her or taught her how to decide\nwhen it was safe to ignore a sign. I was just in her world and she was\nwatching.\nI observed a similar phenomenon with my son. I like to watch\nfootball and my son sat with me and learned to watch too. Twenty\nyears later, when an event occurred on the field, I noticed that we said\nexactly the same thing at the same time. “Oof,” “oh come on,” “ugh.”\nWhatever event on the field caused me to exclaim something, caused\nmy son to exclaim the same thing. Now, I could not tell you what\nwas an “oof” and what was an “ugh,” and neither could he. I do this\nkind of thing unconsciously and so does he. He learned what I had to\nteach, but he doesn’t know what he learned and I don’t know what I\ntaught.\nWhat does this have to do with teaching? Perhaps we just need\nto watch our teachers and then we can copy what they do. Well, not\nexactly.\nI took a yoga lesson the other day. The instructor got into a pose\nand said I was to copy what he did. I said there wasn’t a chance that\nI could copy what he did. He wasn’t used to being talked to like this.\n(Most students are better at being students than I am, of course.) I\nexplained that I could barely understand what he had done, despite\nseeing it, and I certainly didn’t know the intent of what he had done,\nso I wouldn’t know which aspects of his action were significant and\nwhich were unimportant. I told him this was no way to teach.\nNow I know I will not be able to teach the yoga instructor how\nto teach better, and I doubt he will be reading this book. But whether\nyou are teaching yoga or baseball or science or business, the rules are\nthe same. Before I list them, let me start with the top mistakes teachers\nmake. Some of these mistakes are forced on teachers by a badly\ndesigned education system, and some are ones that teachers make no\nmatter what they are teaching or which system they are teaching in.\nSome of these are less than obvious. So, let’s consider them one\nby one:\nMistake #1: Assuming that there is some kind of learning other\nthan learning by doing\nMistake #2: Believing that a teacher’s job is assessment\nMistake #3: Thinking there is something that everyone must\nknow in order to proceed\nHow Not to Teach 173\nMistake #4: Thinking that students are not worried about the\npurpose of what they are being taught\nMistake #5: Thinking that studying can replace repeated practice\nas a key learning technique\nMistake #6: Thinking that because students have chosen to take\nyour course, they have an interest in learning what you plan\nto teach them\nMistake# 7: Correcting a student who is doing something wrong\nby telling him what to do instead\nMistake #8: Thinking that a student remembers what you just\ntaught him\nNow, let’s consider these teaching mistakes one by one.\nMistake #1: Assuming that there is some kind of learning other\nthan learning by doing\nAll of us, teachers or not, believe that we can teach by telling.\nWhen I say that people learn by doing, people think: Yes, maybe most\nof the time, but you also can learn by being told. The issue is what it\nmeans to learn, of course. I define learning in terms of the cognitive\nprocesses that are exercised during the attempt to learn.\nThis means that when I say the following: “You cannot learn by\nbeing told,” what I mean is that that you cannot learn to do any cognitive\nprocess by being told. I can tell you that George Washington\nnever told a lie, and you could learn that and you could make it something\nthat you now believe. But this is not learning in the sense that\nit doesn’t make you more capable of doing something because you\nhave learned it. Subject-based education relies on learning by telling\nbecause for most of the things that are being taught, there is no other\nway to learn them. How else could you learn that George Washington\nnever told a lie? By observation? By historical research? We learn this\nby being told. But we do not learn cognitive processes by simply being\ntold. We learn them by practicing them.\nThis confusion is why teaching in its current form, with a teacher\nin front of a class, exists at all. Without this focus on subject-based\neducation, it could not exist. And, this is why parents never stand in\nfront of their kids teaching them things. Cognitive processes cannot\nbe altered by telling.\nSo, we have rule #1 for teaching:\n174 Teaching Minds\nRule #1: A teacher should never tell a student anything that the\nteacher thinks is true. Now, on the surface this seems ridiculous.\nHow can you resist telling students the truth? Isn’t that your job as a\nteacher? No. It isn’t.\nWhy not?\nBecause, in general, students wouldn’t believe you anyway. Students\ndon’t take what teachers say as gospel. And, they tend not to\nremember what you say. I have taught many a class and asserted X\nonly to be told minutes later that I had asserted not X. People don’t\nlisten very well. So what is the point of saying true things, besides\nfeeling good about having said something wise? The point certainly\nisn’t teaching.\nHow will students learn what is true, then? By discovery. By failure.\nBy repeated experience. By talking with people about what they\nthink and having to defend their claims. Not by listening to you.\nLet’s consider mistake #2.\nMistake #2: Believing that a teacher’s job is assessment\nWhat does this mean? In the real world, teaching and assessment\nare usually conjoined. Teachers teach and they also give grades and\ntest. This is a problem. It is a problem because satisfying the teacher\nbecomes a goal of the student that tends to supersede learning, and it\nis a problem because as the ultimate arbiter of truth, a teacher gets to\nsay what is true and students have to believe it. To fix this a teacher\nneeds to not be in this dual role.\nThis is easier said than done, of course. I used to tell students they\nwould get an A no matter what they did as long as they handed in the\nwork that I asked for. This had the effect of having many students sign\nup for an easy A and having the administration become annoyed with\nhow many A’s I gave out. Both of these outcomes were entirely predictable.\nBut what I did, changed student behavior in the class greatly.\nThey often wrote about how much they wanted to please the\nteacher and how once I took that out of the equation, how much\nit changed their view as to why they were doing anything at all. For\nsome, it had a very bad effect. They just didn’t take the class seriously.\nOthers took it more seriously than ever because they were the judges\nof their own work. (I asked them to defend their viewpoints to the\nclass during class time so their friends were also judges.)\nHow Not to Teach 175\nOf course, the system teachers teach in does not allow them to\nseparate assessment and teaching. But it doesn’t allow them to teach\nonly cognitive processes either. For a cognitive process-based education\nsystem to work, teachers must be allowed to teach, and others\nshould be the ultimate judges of success. Teachers need to help students\nget where they are trying to go and let others decide whether\nthey have gotten there.\nSo, we have rule #2 for teaching:\nRule #2: A teacher should never be the ultimate judge of the\nteacher’s own students’ success. Here again, this seems absurd. But\nin the end, this separation of responsibilities is very important. Parents\njudge how well their children are walking and talking, of course. But\nthe children are not anxious about passing their parents’ assessments.\nThe success is its own reward. And in the end, others judge how well\nyour children speak. A parent is really there to help, not judge.\nLet’s look at mistake #3.\nMistake #3: Thinking there is something that everyone must\nknow in order to proceed\nThis is, of course, the killer mistake. Go to any faculty meeting, or\ninterview any teacher, and he will tell you that something is the basis\nfor all that follows that, and if you don’t know it, you can’t proceed\nin the subject he teaches. Theory first is the mantra of nearly every\nteacher. The question is why this is so. I have been in arguments about\nthis so often that I wonder why these views are so widely held.\nTeach theory first, then practice. Because of this mantra, computer\nscience majors often don’t learn to program in a way that actually\nwould make them hirable, and budding medical students drown in a\nsea of chemistry equations. Businesspeople learn about finance long\nbefore they learn how to run a business, if they ever do learn that, and\npsychology students learn about B.F. Skinner when what they really\nwanted to know is why they are so screwed up.\nWhy do teachers like teaching theory so much? I think that the\nanswer is that it is orderly stuff, with official answers that the teacher\ngets to know while the students try to learn them. This puts the\nteacher in a powerful situation and teachers are comfortable with\nthat. Teaching practice is much harder. There often are no right answers\nand many screw-ups, and the learning process is much messier.\n176 Teaching Minds\nTheory is a subject. Practice in a field means exercising the twelve\ncognitive processes we have been referring to, and because of that,\nprogress is much harder to ascertain. You can test theory. It is harder\nto test practice. One can gain a lot of knowledge about what doesn’t\nwork while practicing and still produce nothing worthwhile. The lessons\nlearned are harder to assess. Teaching theory makes all teachers\nmore comfortable. Of course, theory means there is no doing, so no\none really learns much. After they pass the test, they can forget what\nthey learned with no consequences.\nThere is a big difference between knowing that and knowing how.\nSchools have always emphasized knowing that. The primary reason\nfor this is that the stuff you can say you know is testable. But knowing\nhow is much more important. So we worry that students don’t know\nthat George Washington was president, without asking what the use of\nthat knowledge is. There may be a use for that knowledge. It is doesn’t\ncome to me immediately what that use would be, but let’s assume\nthere is some use for that knowledge for your average student. If so,\nthat knowledge should be taught within the context in which it might\nbe used. There is, for example, a use of that knowledge for constructing\na history paper about the origins of the United States. Of course,\nthat itself may not be a useful exercise. In the context of doing that\nexercise, assuming there was good justification for it, that knowledge\nwould be naturally learned. Natural learning of factual knowledge,\nlearning it when it comes up, is fine, as long as it isn’t being learned so\nthat it can be tested. It is much more useful to learn knowledge when\nthat knowledge enables you to do something, however.\nThere are endless books about what every 3rd-grader must\nknow that use the idea that factual knowledge is the basis of\nthe ability to read as their justification. Unfortunately, the writers\nof these tracts have misunderstood the cognitive science behind\nthose statements. It is difficult to read things when you don’t understand\nwhat they are about. But it does not follow from that,\nthat the solution is to ram that knowledge down kids’ throats and\nthen have them read. It is much more clever to have them read\nabout what they know and to gradually increase their knowledge\nthrough stories that cause them to have to learn more in order to\nmake the stories understandable to them. In that case, the learning\nis in context and thus more natural.\nHow Not to Teach 177\nRule #3: Teach practice first, theory and facts second (if you\nmust teach theory and facts at all). It is the rare course that starts\nwith, let’s build this now. Courses that start like that usually hold the\nstudents’ interest, however.\nNow let’s move on to the next mistake.\nMistake #4: Thinking that students are not worried about the\npurpose of what they are being taught\nWhen students ask what use algebra will be to them, they are told\nthey will need it later. They are told this about any number of subjects\nthat they are forced to learn in high school. The problem is that subject-based\neducation is never about the potential use of those subjects.\nThose were the subjects at Harvard in 1892; that is the only answer\nthat is true about why students are being forced to learn them. No one\ngives that answer. In fact, very few seem to know that answer.\nStudents have the right to know why they are learning something.\n“You will need it later,” is usually a lie, so we need to stop telling them\nthat. And, we need to think about what real reasons there are to learn\nsomething. If we cannot find those reasons, we really shouldn’t be\nteaching the subject. But, of course, I don’t think we should be teaching\nsubjects at all, so my view on this should come as no surprise.\nRule #4: Don’t teach anything unless you can easily explain the\nuse of learning it.\nLet’s look at the next mistake.\nMistake #5: Thinking that studying can replace repeated practice\nas a key learning technique\nPractice makes sense. When studying and homework mean practice,\nthen they are good things. But rarely is that their intent. Unless,\nof course, we are talking about practicing test taking, which makes\nsense only if good test scores are the goal. I realize that good test scores\nare, these days, the goal in our society, as one would expect in any\nsubject-based education system.\nSo here is rule #5:\n178 Teaching Minds\nRule #5: No homework unless that homework is to produce\nsomething.\nNow let’s have a look at mistake #6.\nMistake #6: Thinking that because students have chosen to take\nyour course, they have an interest in learning what you plan to\nteach them\nProfessors who typically teach courses that students have chosen\nvoluntarily to take generally are under the illusion that students have\ncome to the course hoping to learn what they intend to teach. Nothing\ncould be further from the truth. Unless you are teaching human\nsexuality or how to get a job, or abnormal psychology, you generally\ncan expect that students have very little interest in the content you\nare about to share and a great interest in the grade you eventually are\ngoing to give them. The reason for this is simple enough. Professors\nare teaching a subject.\nSubject, in the university world, is a euphemism for profession.\nThe profession of English professors is something other than teaching\nEnglish—it is being a professional in some subspecialty in literature\nor some allied field. Similarly, a professor of psychology has an area of\nresearch within psychology that is his real profession. When a professor\nteaches, he is teaching how things work in his profession and he\nis teaching the basics of being in that profession. The percentage of\nundergraduates in a class that actually want to enter the profession\nof the professors is very small. Most have no intention whatsoever of\nentering the profession of the professors. So, they recognize instantly\nthat what they are learning is very unlikely to be of use to them in\ntheir later lives. Some take it seriously anyway and some don’t. But for\nthe most part students really aren’t much interested in what a professor\nis teaching.\nThey don’t listen and they don’t do what you ask them to do. Why\nnot? They may be lazy, but that isn’t the real reason. It may be true\nthat they are taking four other classes, but that also isn’t the real reason.\nThe real reason has to do with the inherent value of work, which\nis one of the real issues in the transformation from subject-based education\nto cognitive process-based education. Students can feel, rightly,\nthat they have read enough Dickens or have solved enough equations\nHow Not to Teach 179\nto satisfy the teacher or at least to satisfy their own needs in these\nareas. The problem is, as I stated originally, that learning starts with a\ngoal and that the students’ goals may not be the same as the teacher’s\ngoals. Since the students have no Dickens-related goal, and actually\nhave a teacher satisfaction goal, they simply have misestimated what\nwill satisfy the teacher.\nNow let’s consider real goals. Students do not stop driving a car\nbecause they are tired even though they haven’t arrived where they\nare going. They do not fail to ask out Mary Lou on a date because\nthey got bored talking mid-sentence. They do not give up on hitting\na baseball mid-swing or midway through the game. People put in the\neffort required when they are working on truly held goals. Subjectbased\ngoals are almost never truly held. But cognitive process goals\nare nearly always truly held if the student is working on real things. If\nschool wants to deal with artificial things (flying an air flight simulator\ninstead of a real plane, for example, in order to learn to fly), then\nthose artificial things need to feel very real and be very motivating.\nRule #6: Try teaching students things they actually may need to\nknow after they leave school.\nHere is mistake #7.\nMistake# 7: Correcting a student who is doing something wrong\nby telling him what to do instead\nThis one seems really weird. Wouldn’t you tell someone to do\nthings differently or what went wrong when you see them making\na mistake? Most of us would because this seems a reasonable thing\nto do. It just isn’t a reasonable thing for a teacher to do. A teacher\nneeds to help a student think about what went wrong as opposed to\ntelling him what went wrong and how to fix it. What do you think\nhappened? Why did it happen, do you suppose? What could you have\ndone differently?\nWhy does this matter? It matters because self-generated explanations\nare remembered more easily than explanations that we are told.\nIt actually is quite difficult to remember anything you have been told.\nIt is much easier to remember what you yourself have thought up,\nin part because you probably spent some time doing it, considered\n180 Teaching Minds\nalternatives, and finally decided on an explanation, and then perhaps\nyou tested that explanation another time. A self-generated explanation\nis a hypothesis, and hypotheses that we have come up with ourselves\nserve as the basis for learning. We tend to remember what we\nourselves have said and thought more than we remember the words\nof others.\nRule #7: Help students come up with their own explanations\nwhen they have made a mistake.\nHere is the next one.\nMistake #8: Thinking that a student remembers what you just\ntaught him\nI can’t tell you how many times I have said X in a lecture or discussion\nonly to be asked why I believed not X. Why does this happen?\nPeople really don’t listen. They are not being annoying. They really\ncan’t easily listen. There is so much going on in their own heads while\nyou are talking that it is remarkable they hear anything of what anyone\nsays to them. Teachers live in a world where students are worried\nabout the perceptions of their friends, events at home, and a million\nother things that have nothing to do with what a teacher is saying. A\nteacher simply cannot assume that a student will remember what he\nwas just told. In any case, a teacher shouldn’t necessarily be telling\nstudents the truth.\nHow could telling a student the truth be a bad idea? When telling\nis about facts, it is certainly a fine idea. But remember, I do not\nthink that it is the job of a teacher to tell students facts. A teacher’s\nprimary responsibility is to get students to understand the world better\nand to help enhance their capabilities. Neither of these things happens\nthrough a teacher telling a student anything. Comprehension is\nan internal affair, arrived at by thinking. Ability comes from practice.\nNeither comes from a teacher. What a teacher can do is to encourage\nstudents to take on more and thus enhance their capabilities, or think\nmore and thus enhance their comprehension. This means that telling\na student a fact that he needs just makes it all too simple. Figuring out\nwhat you need is the real issue. Confirming what a student has discovered\nis a fine idea, but even that isn’t always a matter of telling the\nstudent the truth. A Socratic teacher might deny what he knows is true\nHow Not to Teach 181\nin order for a student to defend a point of view and learn to be convincing.\nA teacher might fail to praise a student, even when she has\nsucceeded, because the student should know that she has succeeded in\nany case. I am not suggesting that teachers never tell the truth, only\nthat it isn’t necessary to do it all the time.\nSince coming to one’s own conclusions is mostly how we learn,\nthe real job of a teacher is to force students to come to sensible conclusions\nby confronting what they already believe with stuff that is\nantithetical to those beliefs. A confused person has only two choices.\nAdmit he is confused and doesn’t care, or resolve the confusion. Resolving\nthe confusion entails thinking. Teachers can encourage thinking\nby making sure students have something confusing to think about.\nRule #8: Never assume that a student is listening to what you are\nsaying or that what you are saying really matters.\nWhat I have been arguing so far amounts to defining what I\ncall Socratic apprenticeship. Learning by doing is facilitated by a good\nteacher, but that teacher has to be around when needed and has to\nknow what to say and what not to say that will help the student think\nharder. The teacher doesn’t provide answers—he just helps students\nfind out where to look for answers and how to know whether they\nfound the answers. Our current education system does not encourage\nteaching and learning to work this way, and I assume neither did the\nsystem that Plato was criticizing when he started to talk about learning\nby doing and Socratic teaching in the first place.\nBut something important has changed. We can now create apprenticeships\nonline. It is possible to learn by doing in a simulated\nworld set up on the computer that provides for human help as needed.\nWe have been building what we call story-centered curricula for about\n10 years now. Students learn within the context of an intense yearlong\nexperience where they do only projects and produce deliverables\nthat are commented on and improved upon by interaction with a Socratic\nteacher. We have produced them for masters programs at various\nuniversities, for high school programs intended to replace what\nis there now, and for corporations when they wish to create really\neffective training.\nThese curricula change how we learn and how we teach. Both of\nthese need to be reconsidered in the wake of the disaster of an education\nsystem that we have created.\n182 Teaching Minds\nIn summary, a good teacher does the following:\n• never tells a student anything that the teacher thinks is\ntrue\n• never allows himself to be the ultimate judge of his own\nstudents’ success\n• teaches practice first, theory second (if he must teach\ntheory at all)\n• does not come up with lists of knowledge that every\nstudent must know\n• doesn’t teach anything unless he can easily explain the\nuse of learning it\n• assigns no homework unless that homework is to\nproduce something\n• groups students according to their interests and abilities,\nnot their ages\n• ensures that any reward to a student is intrinsic\n• teaches students things they actually may need to know\nafter they leave school\n• helps students come up with their own explanations\nwhen they have made a mistake\n• never assumes that a student is listening to what he is\nsaying\n• never assumes that students will do what he asked them\nto do if what he asked does not relate to a goal they truly\nhold\n• never allows “pleasing the teacher” to be the goal of the\nstudent\n• understands that students won’t do what he tells them if\nthey don’t\n• understand what is being asked of them\n• earns the respect of students by demonstrating abilities\n• motivates students to do better and does not help them\nto do better\n• understands that his job is to get students to do\nsomething\n• understands that experience, not teachers, changes belief\nsystems\n• confuses students\n• does not expect credit for good teaching\nCHAPTER 13\nHow the Best Universities\nInadvertently Ruin Our Schools\nWe have met the enemy, and he is us.\n—Walt Kelly\nIt should come as no surprise to readers of this book that I never really\nliked school. I endured it. I didn’t have the option to quit—an\nunthinkable idea in my household. In the end I even wound up with\na Yale degree (all right, an honorary one—but it is printed in Latin).\nTruth be told, I did get a real Ph.D., but that was more a testament to\nmy figuring out how to work the system while avoiding the draft, than\nit was a testament to my scholarship or academic prowess.\nI became a professor, an unlikely job for someone who hated\nschool, and I became an unlikely colleague who worked with people\nwho, by and large, loved school. I spent 35 years of my life as a professor\nat the best universities in America, and still I hated school.\nSomewhere in the middle of my academic career, about the time\nthat my kids went to school, I began to think about how learning\nworked. (I was trying to develop computers that learned.) Since my\nkids also hated school, I began to wonder about why school was the\nway it was and why it really had so little to do with learning as I understood\nit.\nEventually I realized that I was part of the problem. I readily had\nfound employment in a world that let me think about interesting\nproblems all day and work with really smart graduate students. To\npay for this life of the mind, I was required to teach every now and\nthen. I never really liked teaching for exactly the same reason I didn’t\nlike being on the other side of the classroom. I didn’t get the point.\nI talked. Students listened or at least faked listening, and then there\nwere grades to be given out based on how well they actually had been\nlistening. I didn’t like this game any more as a teacher than I had\n183\n184 Teaching Minds\nliked it as a student. Who said that listening to what I happened to be\ntalking about was an important thing to do? And, who said students\nshould be graded on how well they had listened to whatever truth I\nwas espousing? What if I was saying nonsense? I didn’t think I possessed\na direct line to the truth any more than I had thought that my\nown teachers did. The system didn’t make sense to me as a student\nand it didn’t as a professor.\nBut it was a very easy job. And the pay, despite what people think\nabout professors’ salaries, was pretty good.\nHow hard was this teaching obligation? At Northwestern I was\nrequired to teach one 3-hour- a-week course for 1 quarter every other\nyear. This came to about 36 hours of work in 2 years.\nYes, really.\nSo, how was I part of the problem? Actually my light teaching obligation\nis the tip of the iceberg of an enormous problem. It brings up\nthe question of how and why that light load works for a university, the\nanswer to which sheds light on what is wrong with our school system.\nHow do the economics of a university work such that a professor\ncan teach so little? That is an important question. But an equally\nimportant question is how it is that a professor, who is after all, in the\nmind of the public at least, a teacher, teaches so little and is happy\nabout it?\nPeople used to ask me, when I said that I was a professor, what\nI taught. I would always laugh. I would suggest that they ask me instead\nwhat I was a professor of, which was, of course, the only relevant\nquestion. I didn’t teach much and when I did teach, I hardly taught\ncomputer science, which was actually what I was a professor of. I usually\ntaught my view of how the mind worked. Sometimes I taught how\neducation needed to be fixed. But, anyhow, as I have said, there wasn’t\nall that much teaching going on in my life. Sometimes I taught more\noften than required of me, simply because I was feeling guilty. The\nrules said I didn’t have to teach much but there were students, usually\ngraduate students, who were thinking that as they had attended this\nuniversity in part to interact with me, at least I should teach a course\nthat included them at least once. So I did it because I felt guilty, not\nbecause anyone higher up in the university cared what I did.\nI remember a Yale undergraduate who wanted an appointment\nwith me. He was screaming in the halls, after he had been told that he\ncould see a graduate assistant instead of me, that he had paid $20,000\nHow the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 185\na year (or whatever the tuition was at that time) to attend Yale and he\ndamn well was going to see me. I did in fact see him because he had\na point.\nProfessors are hard to find. There are many reasons for this. The\nfirst is that if no one makes them see undergraduates, so why should\nthey? The second is that from long experience most professors have\ncome to understand that when an undergraduate wants to see them,\nthere typically is one of two motives. Either the student wants to argue\nabout a grade he or she received, or wants to engage the professor in\na conversation whose point is that the undergraduate is really a great\nguy or gal and will be counting on a recommendation down the road.\nNeither of these conversations is any too fascinating to professors so\nthey usually make themselves hard to find.\nThe funny part of this story is that the student who was making\nthe fuss had neither of those issues. He was exactly the sort of student\nprofessors very much want to see. He wanted to become a professor in\nmy field. This is exactly who a professor wants to meet with. The conversation\nwith him didn’t start out about that exactly, but it was easy\nto see that he had real issues he wanted to talk about, science issues,\nthe kind professors wish were on the mind of every undergraduate but\nrarely are. This student did in fact become a professor, the ultimate success\nstory for the professor who guided him there. And, no surprise, he\ntreats undergraduates who want to see him the same way I treated him.\nThere is a naïve conception on the part of students in a top university\nthat their needs matter to the professors of that university. But the\ntop universities are not structured in such a way as to reward professors\nwho care deeply about students. If a young assistant professor spends\ntoo much time with undergraduates, there usually will be some wiser\nhead who will counsel him against this behavior. Assistant professors\nmust be concerned with getting tenure. Having the students like you\nhas next to nothing to do with tenure at the top universities.\nNo one higher up in the administration of the university cared\nmuch about how much I taught. “Why not?” you wonder. To answer\nthis, one has to understand how universities really work, why they\nwork that way, what game they are playing, and who wins and who\nloses. The answers to these questions, well known by anyone in a top\nuniversity, are, somehow, completely unknown to the general public.\nOutsiders don’t ask how Yale works. They ask how they can get their\nkids into Yale. And therein lies the problem.\n186 Teaching Minds\nAs long as the customers keep coming, as long as people will do\nanything to get their kids into Yale, Yale will not have to change. Now\nbear in mind that going to Yale isn’t such a bad experience. This is\nnot my point. But Yale’s attitude (and every other top university’s attitude)\ntoward what those universities are inherently about is seriously\nharming the education of every high school student and almost every\ncollege student in the country. Yale doesn’t know that it is doing this.\nThe faculty of Yale didn’t wake up one morning and think that\ndestroying the American education system would be a good idea. They\nnever think that subject-based education is a bad thing. They are professors\nof subjects, after all. It makes sense to them.\nMost of the Yale faculty doesn’t think for even a minute about\nthe U.S. high school system, or the community college system, or the\nthousands of other colleges in the United States. Yale professors are\nthinking about their research, ideas, and projects. Yale administrators\nare thinking about making Yale work better and about money and\nprestige issues. They are not thinking that the subject-based education\nthat is the basis of the university structure has filtered down to high\nschool for no good reason. They think that there is a good reason: to\nprepare high school students for college, namely to make the professors’\nlives easier when the students arrive at college.\nThey do not know they are killing education with their subject orientation.\nBut they are, just as surely as if they had a plan to do so and\nwere working on it on a daily basis. And, the parents who just must\nsend their kids to Yale are regularly giving them the power to continue\ndoing just that.\nPeople who do not live and work within the confines of a great\nuniversity imagine that professors are basically teachers, like high\nschool teachers but more intellectual. They do not understand the collective\nmindset at a place like Yale, a mindset that the Yale faculty, for\nthe most part, is perfectly happy with. They do not understand why\nasking what I taught was a funny question. They do not readily get, if\nteaching isn’t a professor’s main concern, what exactly his concerns\nwould be.\nTo explain all this requires looking at the life of a typical Yale faculty\nmember and beginning to understand the world in which he\nlives. We must begin by understanding the aims of the university itself.\nUniversities are employers, after all, and professors, like any other\nemployee, worry about what their boss thinks of them. Curiously,\nHow the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 187\nhowever, professors don’t really have bosses in the traditional sense. I\nremember the provost of a top university complaining to me that with\nprofessors everything is a la carte. The provost is the guy who runs the\nuniversity. What he meant was that he could not ask any professor to\ndo anything without the professor asking what he would get in return.\nThe traditional sense of boss is gone, of course, when the boss can’t\nfire you.\nThe real bosses in the university system are your colleagues.\nHuh?\nYour colleagues can’t fire you. But this is what they can do. In\norder to hire a new senior faculty member at Yale, we actually had\nto write letters, at the beginning of the process, to all the important\nfaculty members around the world in the subspecialty in which we\nwanted to hire, asking them to rank the top ten people in the world in\nthat subspecialty. If the person we wanted was not on that top ten list,\nwe would not be able to hire them without proving why we couldn’t\nget one of the people in the top ten and why we so desperately needed\nsomeone who clearly wasn’t that good.\nTop universities are caught up in a game they can’t get out of that\nhas two very bad results. The game is the superstar-prestige game. Top\nuniversities want to be number one. They want this very badly. University\nadministrators worry about this on a daily basis. All hirings\nrevolve around this issue. All professors worry about their status in the\nacademic world at large. It is the coin of the realm in academia.\nAlthough it does not obviously follow from this, one effect of\nthis game is less than stellar education for undergraduates. And, incidentally,\nthis game also has a disastrous effect on the nation’s high\nschools. This is not at all obvious to professors and to the universities\nfor whom they work. To understand this, we need to first see what\nprofessors do and how they think about what they do.\nI will start by telling a story about someone I barely know. He is a\nprofessor of aerospace engineering at the University of Washington,\nwhich is in the top tier of state universities. I met him because I was\nworking on creating a high school aerospace curriculum that I hope\none day will replace some of what is now in high school for those interested\nin engineering. I asked Boeing to host a meeting to design this\ncurriculum and they agreed. They invited some of their engineers as\nwell as this professor, I brought some of my people, and we began to\ndesign a series of projects that would take students with no knowledge\n188 Teaching Minds\nof engineering and after a year allow them to work on designing a\n787. Such a project-based, real-world curriculum is, in my mind, an\nimportant improvement on the way things are done now in school.\nAt the very beginning of the meeting, this professor said that he\nhoped the outcome of this high school curriculum redesign meeting\nwould be a curriculum that taught math and science better because\nthe average student at the University of Washington that he encountered\nhad very weak math and science skills.\nThis was not my intent at all and I told him so. I was hoping to\nallow high school students to have a year-long experience of actually\ndoing engineering so they could decide whether that interested them\nor at least make use of some of what they learned in their later lives.\nAs far as I’m concerned, there is too much math and science in high\nschool now and I told him so.\nSince no one ever says things like that, he was quite shocked. I\nasked him, since he thought entering college students who wished\nto study aerospace were deficient in math and science, why he didn’t\nthink it was his obligation to teach it to them? He replied that this was\nthe duty of the high schools. His position then was that even though\nless than 1% of college students would study aerospace engineering,\nnevertheless every student in the country should be made to learn\nthe math and science they might need just in case they might study\naerospace engineering.\nOf course, this is hardly a unique position. In fact, this stance is\nexactly the one in place in high schools today. Just in case you some\nday might need it, we will teach it to you.\nWhat is the reasoning behind this point of view?\nWhat is really going on here relates strongly to the teaching\nrequirement issue I mentioned earlier. I had a light teaching load. This\nman certainly teaches more often than I did. To see what his load was,\nI looked him up on the web. Here are the courses he was teaching in\n2007–08 as I wrote this:\n• A A 430 Finite Element Structural Analysis\n• A A 432 Composite Materials for Aerospace Structures\n• A A 532 Mechanics of Composite Materials\nI had guessed what kinds of courses he taught before looking him up.\nThe man is about my age, which means he has seniority, and he is\nHow the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 189\nobviously respected by Boeing, so he is a senior and successful man\nin his field. This means a small teaching load since the best professors\nteach the least. Three semester-long courses in a year is a light load at\na big state university.\nYou might wonder, as an outsider to the ins and outs of the university,\nwhy the best professors teach the least. You also might wonder\nwhy I knew the types of courses he would teach and what I mean by\nthat. I will explain.\nTo start this explanation, it is important to understand why professors\nare “rewarded” with light teaching loads. (Note the word load.\nThis is the normal way this is discussed in a university.) I was given\nan extraordinarily light load at Northwestern for two reasons. One\nreason was that universities, like baseball teams, recruit so-called “superstars”\n(yes, that is how they are referred to in the university) from\ncompetitors. So Northwestern had to beat Yale’s offer in my case. At\nYale I taught one semester-long course per year, so Northwestern simply\nmade me a better offer.\nThe reason both of these universities would even consider such a\nlight load is that I earned money for the university. As I used to tell\nmy children when they asked “why” questions, in the end it is usually\nabout money.\nI was recruited by Northwestern (in 1988), but I was really being\nrecruited by Andersen Consulting. They offered Northwestern (that is,\nthey offered me if I came to Northwestern) $30 million (over a 10-year\nperiod). Yes, that’s right, $30 million. I think you can see that Northwestern\ndidn’t really care what I taught or when I taught it. They\nwanted that money. And, they also wanted the prestige.\nBefore I go too much further, I need to explain the prestige thing\nbecause it is very important. In fact, the prestige issue for professors\nand universities is precisely the root of the problem in our education\nsystem. This will take some time to explain, so let me start simply for\nnow.\nWhen Harvard plays Yale in football, they are battling for prestige.\nBut the battle may not be on the field exactly. The real battle is in\nhow powerful and important the alumni who attend the game have\nbecome and how big their respective endowments have become and\nwho has the best chemistry department or business school. It is a real\nbattle. The battle is for reputation. And, although it may seem silly to\ntake this battle seriously, it is taken very seriously. There is no World\n190 Teaching Minds\nSeries that determines the winner. The real determination is made by\nnewspapers, or parents who want their kids to apply there, or potential\ndonors. But the battle is real enough.\nThis battle was dead serious before U.S. News and World Report\nstarted publishing annual rankings. Now, it is the basis of how the\nuniversity functions. When the current president was recruited at\nNorthwestern, he essentially was told that his job was to get Northwestern\ninto the top ten (in the U.S. News rankings). Northwestern was\nranked 12th or 13th at this time. In his first year he succeeded. Why?\nBecause Northwestern’s football team won the Big Ten title and went\nto the Rose Bowl. Of course, he had nothing to do with that. But the\nfollowing year applications doubled (or something like that) and that\nis a statistic that U.S. News uses, so presto, we were number nine. It\ndidn’t last. Neither did it make sense.\nRecruiting me was like winning the Rose Bowl. Well, all right, not\nreally. But a member of the Board of Trustees actually did say to me\nwhen he met me: “It’s our star quarterback.” I brought in money and\nprestige. It is natural to wonder who actually got the money that Andersen\noffered and what was done with it and why it was given out,\nand, while we are at it, what exactly it was I did all day if I didn’t teach.\nFirst the university’s share. Every dollar of that $30 million went\ninto Northwestern’s bank account. Then they let me spend it according\nto certain rules. The first rule is called “overhead.” The university\ncharges an overhead rate on all contracts. The actual percentage varies\nand one of the first things I had to negotiate with Northwestern was\nhow much their take would be. I don’t remember exactly now, but\nthey got about 30% of what I brought in. So, about $9 million of this\nmoney went into Northwestern’s pocket. Do you see now why they\ndidn’t care how much I taught? They just wanted me there and they\nwanted that money. By the way, they also got the interest on all the\nmoney.\nThey also got the prestige. I set up a new institute that became instantly\nwell known and was something the university could brag about.\nThe Institute for the Learning Sciences was something unique. Northwestern\nhad one and no one else did. Moreover, I might (and did) raise\neven more money for my institute. More overhead money. Yippee!\nWhat did I do with the money? Mostly what you can do with\nthis money is hire people. If you have a research agenda, something\nyou want to build or accomplish, you will need help. If you want to\nbuild a rocket ship that no one has ever built before, you will need to\nHow the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 191\nhire folks who can contribute. I was trying to build educational software\nbut the principle was the same. I hired programmers, researchers,\nassistants to do lower level work, video staff, artists, and, of course,\ngraduate students.\nAnd, now you know what I did all day. I managed this enterprise.\nEventually my institute had 200 people working in it. I did what any\nperson in charge of 200 people does. I set the direction and checked\non progress. Also, I wrote books and thought deep thoughts. This is\nwhat any professor does who brings in grant money. I was just doing\nit on a larger scale than most.\nAll of this is about winning the prestige game. Any university\nwants pre-eminent professors. Universities want the best faculty so\ntheir name is mentioned a lot, so they get applications from students,\nattention from the media, and more grant money. That is what universities\ndo. Teaching? Well, how exactly does teaching fit in with all\nthat?\nIt really doesn’t. Most professors agree that the university is a lot\nnicer place when there aren’t all those undergraduates around. From\nMay to September New Haven was an idyllic place. Smart people, good\nweather, interesting conversation. Then in September, thousands of\nyoung people, making a racket and expecting to be taught. But, therein\nlies the problem. Are students really expecting to be taught?\nIt doesn’t take very long for a professor to learn that those brilliant\nYale students, the ones who killed themselves to get into the place, may\nnot be there solely to enter into the life of the mind. While everyone\nis thinking great thoughts and doing great research over the summer,\nprofessors manage to get themselves believing that the job of a professor\nat a great university is to be an intellectual. What they forget easily\nenough is who is paying the bills. And, they forget the real agenda of\nthose who are paying the bills. They are reminded soon enough.\nStudents want courses to be easy, not bother them too much with\nwork outside the classroom, and help them get a good job. Of course,\nI am oversimplifying here. Many students attend Yale to learn what it\nis that you, the professor, really know and want to teach. In 15 years\nat Yale I met a number of them. I remember their names because there\nweren’t that many. We can hope that all professors have met their\nshare of that type of student.\nMost college students are 18-year-olds who are on their own for\nthe first time. They are more interested in exploring themselves and\ntheir new freedoms than they are in working hard at intellectual\n192 Teaching Minds\npursuits. Every university has underground lists, written by students,\nabout courses that are easy or professors who readily give good grades.\nThe real agenda of the majority of students is to take school just seriously\nenough to graduate. If you offered them a diploma after 1 year,\nmost of them would take the deal.\nThis all brings me back to our aerospace friend. Why does he want\nhigh schools to teach more math? Because he doesn’t want to teach it.\nTeaching undergraduates becomes pleasurable at precisely the point\nwhere you can teach the very courses this man teaches. He is teaching\nhighly technical courses, and, it is safe to assume, the students\nwho are taking those courses are there with serious intentions. They\nwant to become engineers and they want to know what he knows. So\nhe may well enjoy teaching them. But he certainly would not enjoy\nteaching them calculus. There is a big difference in the experience of\nteaching when you are teaching people who plan on working in your\nfield some day and when you are teaching a required course that students\nwish they weren’t being made to take.\nBut why does it matter what this man enjoys teaching?\nIn the ideal university, the one professors at top-tier universities\nwould have if it were possible, professors, who consider themselves\nprimarily to be researchers in very specialized subfields, would teach\nonly work that directly related to their actual research or was important\nfor preparing future researchers in their field.\nProfessors at Yale get to be professors at Yale because they are either\npotentially or actually the best in the world at something. While this\nmight not actually be true, it is certainly supposed to be true. When\na professor is proposed to be promoted (or hired for the first time) as\na full professor at Yale, the chair of his department must address a\nmeeting of all the other chairs and high officials and explain why the\nprofessor in question is indeed the best in the world at what he does.\nTo do this, the chairs often have to define what he does extremely\nnarrowly to have it be at all credible. Isn’t there someone at Stanford\nor Princeton who is just as good or, perish the thought, even better\nthan the candidate you propose? There better not be or this candidate\nwon’t get voted in. So, somewhere in every professor’s mind is the idea\nthat he or she is the best at something or for assistant professors, soon\nwill become the best at something.\nUnder this kind of pressure, and this kind of egotism, a professor’s\nfirst and foremost concern is attaining and maintaining that exalted\nHow the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 193\nstatus. Teaching future professors in one’s own field helps maintain\nthat status, so graduate students pursuing Ph.D.s are quite often taken\nvery seriously. Teaching graduate seminars is intellectually stimulating,\nmay help with one’s own research, and is therefore worthwhile\nto do. But undergraduates are a whole different story. Very small percentages\nof them actually will become researchers in one’s field. Professors\nare in the fame game. They worry about the prestige of their\ndepartment and themselves. They care about this because they won’t\nattract high-quality Ph.D. students unless they maintain that prestige.\nUndergraduates do not figure into this equation. Except they do pay\nthe bills.\nSo professors have to teach them. And, someone has to teach those\ndamn introductory courses that typically have hundreds of students\nin them. Why do they have hundreds of students in them? Because\nno one wants to teach them so making the sections as large as possible\nmeans fewer professors will have to teach them. And, why does our\naerospace guy want high school to teach the math his students need?\nBecause he certainly doesn’t want to do it. He wants to teach esoteric\ncourses about composites, which is his field. Teaching basic math\nwould be worse than teaching Introduction to Aerospace. A great deal\nof work and no enhancement to prestige at all. And, there is a bigger\nproblem. He can’t teach math because the structure of the university\ndoesn’t allow it.\nMath is taught by the math department. If everyone had to learn\nmath, there would have to be an awful lot of math professors. While\nthat sounds OK, it really isn’t possible. Remember, at top universities\neveryone has to be a superstar or close. Math isn’t that hot of a\nfield. There aren’t large numbers of people wanting to become math\nprofessors, nor is there a great deal of funding for math research. Remember,\nwithout outside funding as a possibility, a top university isn’t\ngoing to want to create a big department. You get big departments,\nand lots of professors, only in fields that pay for themselves through\noutside funding. So math has to stay small. Solution—make sure math\nis taught in high school.\nThis solution makes everyone in the university happy. And, it\nshouldn’t be a big surprise that the original idea of requiring algebra\nof high school students came from the president of Harvard and\nthe chairman of the Princeton Math Department (in 1892). It has always\nbeen in the university’s interest to push teaching the basics that\n194 Teaching Minds\nare needed in college into the hands of the high schools so that the\nuniversity professor’s life is easier and involves less teaching that he\ndoesn’t want to do.\nSo, of course, professors want high schools to do a better job. The\nquestion is why high schools should care about what universities want\nat all. High schools have their own problems, or should have, but they\nhave been convinced to ignore their problems and focus on the problems\nthat universities have.\nParents demand that high schools prepare their kids for college,\nwhich really means help them get into college. Gradually the high\nschool curriculum has become one giant entrance test for college. The\nidea that someone might not want to go to college seems very odd to\nmost people. So, if the colleges say more math, then more math it is.\nBut colleges are not saying more math in good faith. They are just having\nhigh schools teach what they don’t want to teach.\nBut there are about 3,000 colleges in the United States and only\nabout 50 top-tier research universities. What Yale needs may not be\nwhat the other colleges need. Why, then, is the tail wagging the dog?\nYale says jump and everybody asks how high. Yale sets the rules. Yale\nsays 3 years of math, and 3 years of math it is, even though higher\nmath will not, or at least should not, come up in most college classes.\nDoes Yale know it is doing this? Do the faculty understand that\nby requiring that the high schools teach mathematics, they are causing\nmassive numbers of dropouts and making learning a very stressful\nexperience for most high school students?\nI think the answer is no, but even if they did know it, they would\ndo nothing about it. They have a university to run and they simply\ncannot change the way they operate. I can explain this with a story,\nthis time from Columbia University.\nI once had the opportunity to create courses for Columbia University\nthat would be put online through a business I started that\nwas funded (and then abruptly terminated when the dot com boom\nbusted) by venture capitalists. I interviewed various professors at Columbia\nin order to decide which courses to put online. I wasn’t trying\nto simply copy the courses they had but was trying to build learn-bydoing\nversions of them that would be more engaging than the usual\nlecture course and would try to teach real-world skills rather than the\nusual stuff one gets in an introductory course.\nWe decided to build an economics course and talked at length with\nthe chairman of the Economics Department. We decided to simulate\nHow the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 195\nthe experience that this man had had working as an economic advisor\nin the White House. The students played that role in the simulation\nand learned how economics is used in the real world.\nAll of this is really beside the point, however. I learned, during\nthese conversations, that at Columbia calculus is required in order to\nbe an economics major. I wondered about this, since the courses we\nwere building never had any complicated math in them, so it seemed\nthat calculus wasn’t something that came up regularly in real-world\neconomics.\nI asked and was told that my observation was right and that calculus\nwas required in order to ensure that there wouldn’t be too many\neconomics majors. As an insider in the university world, I understood\nthis remark, but it needs some explaining for outsiders.\nColumbia doesn’t have an undergraduate business major. And, in\nNew York City there are a lot of students interested in business. Columbia\nand other Ivy League schools think that business isn’t an academic\nsubject, so students shouldn’t learn it until they go to graduate school.\nColumbia does have a well-respected business school, but, as I pointed\nout, no one really wants to teach undergraduates so they certainly\naren’t lobbying to teach them. (This is also true of medical schools and\nlaw schools and it is why you never see courses for undergraduates in\nthose fields despite the evident interest of the undergraduates.)\nSo, potential businesspeople at Columbia need to major in something\nand economics seems to them to be a reasonable second choice.\n(I am not really sure that it is a good choice but these are 18-year-olds\nmaking these decisions.) Thus, the Economics Department is flooded\nwith potential majors. This seems like it would be a good thing,\ndoesn’t it? Students want to study what you teach. Isn’t that good?\nWell, not really.\nLet us assume we have an economics faculty of 20 people, each of\nwhom teaches three courses a year. So we can offer 60 courses. Sounds\nlike a good number. But this has to include graduate seminars, and\nthe faculty will be lobbying to have more of these and more advanced\ncourses where they can teach their own specialty, as I have said. But\nmajors need courses too. They might need 20 or more. This doesn’t\nleave a lot for introductory courses unless the department runs enormous\nlecture courses that have hundreds of students. Now departments\nknow that such courses are pretty awful things and they try to\nkeep them down to a dull roar. But if you have hundreds of students\nwanting to take your courses, and you were set up with just enough\n196 Teaching Minds\nfaculty to handle 60 courses with fewer than 20 students in each class,\nyou have a problem. Multiple sections of courses require multiple faculty\nand maybe even, God forbid, heavier teaching loads.\nSimply put, if there are too many majors, all the specialty courses\nwill overflow and you might need twice the faculty to handle them.\nThe university is not going to let you hire twice the faculty in order to\nhandle them. Why not?\nTenure is why not. Once you hire tenured faculty, they stay forever.\nTenure is another one of those ideas that sounds a lot better than\nit is. One of its downsides, and it has many, is that you can’t easily\nhire new faculty when you need to. There may be a jump in economics\nmajors this year, but who is to say that this will be true next year?\nUniversities move slowly.\nSo, the current economics faculty would have to teach more courses.\nThey simply do not want to do that. They want to go back to their\noffices and do research and write books and consult with the government\nor big business, should they call.\nVoila!\nCalculus.\nThat will keep the little buggers out. If that doesn’t work, advanced\ncalculus. Who cares if those courses have little relevance for economics?\nThey can always say it might come up some day. (It might.) Or\nthey can say it teaches rigorous thinking. The real reason is to keep the\nnumbers down. This is also why biology and chemistry are required\ncourses for pre-med students, why statistics is required for psychology\nmajors, and so on. Most departments will not admit to this, but that’s\nwhy those things are there.\nYou never see this kind of thing in departments that have too few\nstudents. Too few students is the kind of problem that gets your department\nshut down. So, linguistics departments, which were started\nwhen linguistics was in fashion in the 1960s, are always under threat\nof shut down. They won’t be requiring calculus. But they would if\ntheir situation changed. Instead, what they are doing is trying to explain\nwhy linguistics is calculus.\nHuh?\nWhen I arrived at Northwestern, undergraduates were required to\ntake a math course in order to graduate. There could have been any\nnumber of reasons for this requirement—none of them having to do\nwith interests or needs of the undergraduates.\nHow the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 197\nIn fact, diverting from that story for a moment, my secretary, who\nnever went to college, insisted that her daughters go, so one of them\nfound herself in an art history course that she hated and complained\nto her mother who in turn complained to me. Why does she have to\ntake art history? She is a business major (at Hofstra), for God’s sake,\nsaid my secretary.\nObviously, I replied, there are art history professors who are worried\nthat no one will take their course and they will be fired (tenure\ndoesn’t apply in that case as tenured faculty can be fired if their department\nis shut down), so they have lobbied successfully to require it.\nShe thought that was stupid and so do I. Now back to Northwestern.\nClearly the mathematics professors at Northwestern were similarly\nconcerned. Of course, they made their argument, the same way\nthe Hofstra art history professors did, one would assume, about these\ncourses being necessary for a liberal education, but the real argument\nwas about saving the department and everyone knew it.\nBut at Northwestern, this math argument had been made a long\ntime ago. What was new was that linguistics, at Northwestern, had\nbeen classified as a math course! The reasons are clear enough. No one\nwas taking linguistics at Northwestern and the linguists were scared.\nHow they won the argument that linguistics was math (and thus an\nalternative to the required math course) is anybody’s guess. Just remember\nthat none of this is being done with the interests of the students\nas the real agenda item.\nIf you believe, as universities do, that the most important thing\nyou can do as an administrator is recruit superstars to make your university\ngreat, then there is a consequence to all this. The students suffer.\nAt first this seems an odd idea. How could a student be harmed by\nrecruiting a superstar? Well, it depends on the university.\nAt MIT, where students are different than they are at Northwestern\nby quite a bit, there are a number of superstars that I know quite well.\nTwo of them, whom I will not name but are about as famous as a professor\ncan be, are people I have heard lecture many times. I have never\nunderstood what they were talking about in any of those lectures. Now,\nbear in mind that I know their fields very well so I should have been\nable to understand them. Also, bear in mind that I was a terrible student,\nwhich means my attention fades fast when I am bored or irritated.\nSince I know these two men well enough, I can tell you that neither\nis particularly worried about being understood. They have been\n198 Teaching Minds\nacclaimed by one and all to be brilliant, and many brilliant people\nthink that if you can’t understand what they are thinking about, then\nit is your fault not theirs. They are talking about complex issues that\ninterest them, and you should be able to follow along, and if you can’t\nthen you are a dope.\nThis works at MIT, sort of. No MIT student happily admits to not\nunderstanding what the professor is saying. They all muddle through\nas best they can and are usually awestruck by even being in the presence\nof these great men, much less being able to take a course from\nthem. Understanding what they said, or, worse, actually being able\nto make use of what they said, seems unimportant by comparison.\nYou would take a course given by Einstein, wouldn’t you, even if you\ndidn’t understand physics? That is the attitude.\nThis attitude works at MIT. But it fails miserably at lesser schools.\nI took advanced calculus from a superstar when I was an undergraduate.\nI didn’t understand anything. I was a math major, but that\ncourse caused me to lose interest in math and start thinking about\nother things. I went to see this superstar and asked him for advice. We\nhad a great conversation. He was a very smart guy. He pointed me in\na direction that helped me make some important decisions. As a oneon-one\nadvisor he was great. But the system made him teach, which\nreally wasn’t something he could do very well.\nAs luck would have it, years later when I was chairman of the\nComputer Science Department at Yale, he was one of my faculty. So,\nin a sense he wound up working for me (to the extent that any faculty\nmember actually works for the chair, which is really not the case).\nHe was a great man. He inspired many a graduate student to become\na professor. He was fun to talk to. But he couldn’t teach at all.\nAt Yale we made sure that he taught only specialty courses, which was\nfine with him. What he was doing teaching advanced calculus that year\nlong ago is anybody’s guess. My guess is that as he was the chairman of\nthe Math Department at the time, either he got stuck with it because\nthere was nobody else or he was trying to prove a point in order to induce\nsenior faculty to come down from on high and teach the basics.\nEither way it was a terrible idea.\nPrestigious universities that recruit superstars are not, at the same\ntime, recruiting teachers. They are just hoping someone can and will\nteach. But no one cares that much.\nI once had dinner with a man who was on the Board of Trustees of\nthe University of Illinois. I asked him how he liked being on the board\nHow the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 199\nof a fraudulent institution. He reacted the way you might expect and\ndemanded an explanation. I asked him if he thought the average student\nattending the University of Illinois was going there because she\nfigured after graduation she would be able to get a job.\nHe agreed.\nI then asked whether job skills were in fact taught to the majority\nof students there and whether the faculty, by and large, actually had\never worked anyplace but a university.\nHe laughed.\nIt is OK that Yale hires only intellectuals and only the best of the\nbest because Yale is not a state-run institution and Yale can do what it\nwants. No one is making anyone go to Yale. Caveat emptor.\nBut a state spending a great deal of money on its flagship educational\ninstitution ought to know what it is getting.\nThis is what it is getting—Yale.\nThere are no faculty members at the University of Illinois in any\nmainstream department (I don’t mean agriculture, for example) who\ndo not consider themselves the equal of, and in some cases better\nthan, their Yale colleagues.\nWhen I went to Northwestern, I was given the right to hire a variety\nof faculty in a number of disciplines that related to learning.\nWhen you recruit faculty, you mostly consider how your institution\nmight look better to someone at another institution. So, Northwestern\ndoesn’t recruit from Harvard or MIT (or Yale!) very often because Chicago\ndoesn’t seem a more appealing place than Boston to an academic\nand Northwestern isn’t a step up. And, Northwestern doesn’t recruit\nfrom California in general, for the same reason.\nSo, it’s the University of Illinois!\nI recruited heavily from Illinois because Chicago looks more appealing\nthan Champaign-Urbana to most people, so I had something\nto offer, and the faculty there had already bought into the idea of living\nin the Midwest. Moreover, in the academic world, the University\nof Illinois is considered to a top-ranked institution with a faculty every\nbit as good as Yale’s, maybe better in some departments.\nSo, why is this bad?\nIt is bad for the students of the state of Illinois who worked hard\nto get into the state’s best university only to discover that its faculty\nthink they are at Yale.\nOf course, they know they are not at Yale, but they are competing\nin that world nevertheless. They also do research and publish and\n200 Teaching Minds\nwork hard to be famous superstars. They are in exactly the same game\nas their Yale counterparts, so it follows that they don’t want to teach\neither.\nBut the numbers are much bigger at Illinois. Classes are larger and\nfaculty have to teach more classes. So these same people, who would\nreadily move to an institution that didn’t treat them like this, are stuck\ncompeting with their Yale colleagues and, at the same time, having so\nmany more undergraduates to deal with.\nGuess who loses?\nAnd, I haven’t even started to discuss the idea that most students\nat Illinois do not go there to become professors or intellectuals, or\nhobnob with the best and brightest. The faculty think they are (or\nought to be) at Yale, but the students do not. The students want to\nget jobs 4 years later. Good luck with that. That is not what Yale is for.\nI was told that explicitly one day, by the way. I had to give a short\ntalk to entering freshmen at Yale when I was the department chair.\nThe idea was to extol the virtues of majoring in the field represented\nby the chair. Each chair gave a short speech. Mine, as usual, was the\nshortest. Major in computer science—get a job. That was my speech.\nI was booed.\nI was booed by the freshmen, who by this time at Yale had been\nthere maybe 5 minutes but had already absorbed the zeitgeist of the\nplace. Yale was for thinkers not workers.\nBy the way, that was in 1982 or so. All our computer science graduates\nwent to work at Microsoft in those years. There were lots of millionaire\nalums not too long after. (Presumably, not those who were booing.)\nThey wouldn’t have booed at Illinois, and that is the point. Yale\nis not the problem unless you realize that it sets the direction for every\nother university in the country. It doesn’t do this by itself and it\ndoesn’t do it intentionally. Nevertheless, it ruins the chances that Illinois\ngraduates will receive a reasonably practical education that actually\nmight get them jobs or teach them how to live in the real world.\nSo, we have created a system that values heavy intellectuals and\ngives them a place to do their thing. Is this bad? How could it be bad?\nIt certainly isn’t bad for the intellectuals. But it is bad for the students.\nNot necessarily for the students at Yale, although there are certainly\nunhappy students there. It is bad for the society at large. Students\ndon’t need to major in subjects unless they intend to become professionals\nin those subjects. Actually, they need to intend to be professional\nresearchers in those subjects, since the faculty really don’t know\nHow the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 201\nhow to or care to think about their subject as anything other than a\nresearch area. Making a real living with what they teach is not on any\nfaculty member’s mind. But students go to college precisely because\nthey think they will get a job afterward that college will have prepared\nthem for. It just isn’t true.\nTeaching how to survive in the real world is simply not the job of\nan Ivy League professor. This is too bad because there are professors\nwho really do like to teach.\nOne day I decided that I needed some news video from the major\nnetworks for a project I wanted to start. I called the president of\nNorthwestern and asked him if he knew anyone at the networks, and\nhe told me that the former president of one of them was now on our\njournalism faculty.\nSo I called him. He said he would help me but only on one condition.\nHe wanted me to sit in on the class he taught. This was really an\nodd request, and especially hard for me to agree to given how much I\nhate classes and classrooms. But I really wanted that video.\nProfessors almost never ask other professors to watch them teach.\nOne reason is that they usually aren’t all that proud of their teaching\nand don’t want to hear the criticism that inevitably follows. Also, it\nreally isn’t something they want to talk about even if they are good at\nit. It has minor value in a professor’s world.\nThe class I attended was the most extraordinary I had ever witnessed.\nThis former head of a network previously had been head of the\nnews division. He had turned his class into an all-day simulation of a\nnetwork newsroom. Students were charged with preparing and producing\nthe evening news. They got their information from various sources\nthat were used by the networks and prepared stories, played the roles\nof on air reporter, news writer, anchor, camera person, editors, and so\non. They finished and went on air at 5.00. At 5:30 they watched to see\nwhat the networks had done that day and compared and judged their\nown success. The professor was there all day guiding them.\nI thought this class was fantastic and said so. I then said it would\nbe a loss when he left Northwestern in a couple of years. He said he\nhad no intention of leaving, but I knew what he was doing would\nnever be tolerated.\nWhy not?\nLet me count the reasons. First, he was teaching doing and practice,\nand not theory and analysis. While the rest of the world knows\nthat doing and practice is how you learn, this is the exact opposite of\n202 Teaching Minds\nhow teaching occurs in a great university. (There are exceptions to this,\nof course. In engineering, agriculture, and even in journalism, practice\ndoes occur. But it always occurs in the presence of lots of theory.)\nUniversity professors are not practitioners. Usually they don’t\nknow a thing about how what they teach actually is used in the real\nworld, never having been in the real world themselves, so they have\ncreated a culture where theories and ideas are considered to be more\nimportant than simply being able to do something. So one reason his\nclass would have to go is that it inevitably would be seen as threatening\nto the other faculty.\nAnother reason that it threatens the other faculty is that it is a\nlot of work to do what he did. He was there all day. Professors teach\n3 hours a week, 6 if they aren’t superstars. No one wants to see a new\nstandard of teaching created that is both practical and takes a long\ntime to do. When would the professors do their research and write\ntheir books? This man didn’t have that agenda. He just wanted to\nteach. There is no room for that in a top-tier university.\nAnd, how would this class fit in a student’s schedule? Students can’t\nspend all day at something without missing those important required\nclasses that meet 3 times a week for an hour. Totally consuming classes\nthat take all day, and may even take all week, cannot possibly exist.\nTwo years later this man was gone.\nIt is actually very difficult to change the way a university runs, and\nthis includes trying to change any aspect of how courses are offered\nor structured.\nI learned this when I took on the job of building a new West Coast\ncampus for Carnegie Mellon University. (By building, I mean designing\nits offerings, not its buildings.) As I am an advocate of learning by\ndoing, in just the way our former network head was doing in his class,\nI decided that there would be no courses, only projects, and that each\nproject would build on the one that preceded it. The administration\nin Pittsburgh let me get away with this precisely because there were no\nfaculty hired in California and the Pittsburgh faculty wouldn’t much\nnotice what we were doing 2,000 miles away.\nWe had to lie to the registrar about what we were doing because\ncourses had to be in parallel to make it into their system and we\nweren’t offering courses at all. The projects had to be labeled as courses,\nbut they varied in length (not every project takes the same amount\nof time). These “courses” ran in sequence not parallel, so we basically\nhad to lie about it to get by the registrar.\nHow the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 203\nThe students objected that there were no faculty around and were\nno classes, so they felt cheated in some way and asked why they had\nto show up at all. We replied that they didn’t, since all the materials\nthey needed were online anyway. The students were assigned mentors\nwho were on campus, but after a while students interacted with them\nby instant message instead of walking down the hall even when the\nstudents were on campus. The students started out hating what we\ndid and wound up loving it. These were students in master’s degree\nprograms and they were, in essence, simulating the jobs they were\npreparing for.\nEven the faculty in Pittsburgh came to appreciate what we were\ndoing in California. But you will never hear about it (except from me).\nCarnegie Mellon will never brag about it or publicize it in any way.\nWhy not?\nWhat I did is very threatening. At one point the provost, realizing\nthat since the program was online, in principle we could serve a lot of\nstudents, asked me whether I was going to put Golden Arches over the\ncampus and say over a million served. Seemed a good idea to me. But\nnot to Carnegie Mellon. We don’t want to cheapen our brand name,\nthe provost told me.\nIn other words, if hundreds of thousands of people had Carnegie\nMellon degrees, how prestigious would such a degree be? These degrees\nwere in computer science, a field in which Carnegie Mellon is\nnumber one or two in the world. But if too many people had these\ndegrees, the university’s prestige would go down, so whether or not\nthis was good educational practice, and the certifying boards certainly\nthought it was, this was never going to happen.\nI made the mistake of saying in an interview how well our experiment\nwas going, and was told by Carnegie Mellon to stop doing that.\nIt seemed that parents of undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon were\ncalling and asking why, if this method was so preferable to the usual\ncourse-based method, it wasn’t being employed in Pittsburgh? Since\nthat could never happen—the professors would never allow it—I had\nto stop giving interviews.\nAs I write this, the learn-by-doing master’s degree programs we\nbuilt are still running, but no more will be developed at Carnegie Mellon.\nEventually the ones I built will be shut down. The reason will be\nthat they employ teachers who teach (as mentors) all the time and\ntherefore don’t do research and that can’t be allowed. Not if you are in\nthe superstar prestige game.\n204 Teaching Minds\nUniversities will not change until some equally prestigious online\nuniversity is developed that challenges their ability to attract students.\nAs long as students show up at Yale, and there is no danger there in the\nforeseeable future, Yale does not have to change.\nBut Yale must understand what it is doing to the high school system.\nIt has to stop telling the high schools what to teach. It has to stop\ntalking about how high schools must prepare students for college.\nThat should not be its job. Yale has to accept the idea that students\nwill arrive at Yale “unprepared” for college. Making Yale’s admissions\nprocess easier should not be the job of the high schools. Teaching the\nsubjects that superstars don’t want to teach should not be the job of\nthe high schools. High schools need to focus on the concerns and issues\nof real students living in the real world. If Yale really believes in\nalgebra for its students, then it can teach algebra to all entering freshmen.\n(Believe me, it never will.)\nUntil subjects cease to be the basis of the structure of universities,\nthere will be a big problem in education across the planet because everyone\neverywhere assumes that university degrees are important. As\nlong as we assume this, and as long as we accept that what is taught\nin high school will be determined by the universities, we are in serious\ntrouble. High schools have become college preparation centers and\nthus no one learns anything but academic subjects in high school.\nCognitive processes must be the meat of high schools and should\nbe the basis of college as well. The top-tier colleges will not change and\nmaybe they shouldn’t. They can continue to be research universities\nand specialize in producing the next generation of Nobel physicists or\nliterary scholars. Great scientists are nice and I am all for producing\nthem. But the 3,000 colleges in the United States are not all producing\ngreat physicists. Still they teach chemistry and require mathematics\nfor no reason that anyone can remember.\nIf we don’t start thinking seriously about how to teach thinking,\nas opposed to academic subjects, to the 99% of students who have no\nintention of becoming scholars, we will all lose.\nCHAPTER 14\nWhat Can We Do About It?\nSimple solutions seldom are. It takes a very unusual mind to\nundertake analysis of the obvious.\n—Alfred North Whitehead\nWhat is obvious here? Schooling is broken. It needs to be rethought.\nWhat can we build as an alternative? It is a simple question really. If\nwe had all the resources in the world and we really wanted to educate\nour children, where education means teach them to think clearly,\nlive well-thought-out lives, and be able to pursue their dreams, what\nwould we build?\nIt is, of course, very difficult to think about replacing sacred institutions.\nThe only way I know to think about it, is as a thought\nexperiment. Just imagine that we lived in a different world, maybe a\nGreek colony in the 1st century, and ask yourself how we might educate\nour children in this environment, pretending that schools are the\none thing we cannot build for some reason. As we think about this,\nwe must not assume that what we teach in schools now needs to be\ntaught in some other way. We simply need to ask: What should one\nteach children? while making no assumptions that what we have been\nteaching is necessarily relevant.\nTo put this another way, the right question to ask is: What do children\nneed to be able to do, in order to function in the world they inhabit?\nThe next question is, of course, How would we teach children to do\nthose things?\nNow admittedly I am prejudicing the answer here by simply leaving\nout the word know. The usual question is, What should children\nknow? It is this question that leads people to make lists of things every\n3rd-grader should know and allows school boards to create lists of\nfacts students need to be tested on. So, let’s leave that word out of the\ndiscussion and see where it gets us.\n205\n206 Teaching Minds\nA good place to start is to ask what a highly functioning adult can\ndo and moreover has to be able to do in order to live in this world.\nWhen we ask this question, the phrase “21st-century skills” will not\ncome up. Every time that phrase comes up, somehow the answer\nturns out to include algebra and calculus and science, which, the last\nI heard, were 19th-century skills too.\nIn fact, let’s not talk about particular centuries at all. To see why,\nI want to diverge for a moment into a discussion of the maritime industry,\na subject with which I have become more fascinated over the\nyears. What did a mariner from Ancient Greece have in common with\nhis modern counterpart in terms of abilities?\nThe answer is an obsession with weather, ship maintenance, leadership\nand organization, navigation, planning, goal prioritization,\nand handling of emergencies.\nEffective mariners from ancient times would have in common\nwith those of today is an understanding of how to operate their ships,\nthe basic laws of weather, tides, navigation, and other relevant issues\nin the physical world, and an ability to make decisions well when\ncircumstances are difficult. They also would have to know how to get\nalong with fellow workers, how to manage the people who report to\nthem, as well as basic laws of commerce and defense.\nIn fact, the worlds they inhabit, from an educational point of view,\nthat is, from thinking about what to teach and how to teach it, would\nbe nearly identical except for one thing: how to operate and maintain\nthe equipment. Their ships were, of course, quite different.\nSo, let’s reformulate this question that seems to haunt every modern-day\npundit on education (usually politicians or newspaper people).\nWhat are 21st-century skills? Can this question be transformed (for\nmariners) into what does a 21st-century mariner need to be educated\nabout that his Ancient Greek counterpart was not educated about?\nThe answer, it seems obvious to me, is 21st-century equipment\nand procedures: engines, navigation devices, particular political situations,\ncomputers, and so on. But, and this is an important “but,” none\nof this stuff is the real issue in the education of a mariner. The real\nissue is decision making. What one has to make a decision about is\nsecondary to the issue of knowing how to make a decision at all.\nYou can learn about a piece of equipment or a procedure by apprenticeship.\nStart as a helper and move on gradually to being an expert.\nBut this is not what school emphasizes. School typically attempts\nto intellectualize these subjects. Experts write books about the theory\nWhat Can We Do About It? 207\nof how something works and the next we know, schools are teaching\nthat theory as a prelude to actually doing the work. Scholarship has\nbeen equated with education. You do not have to know calculus to repair\nan engine. You might want to know calculus to design an engine,\nbut that is no excuse for forcing every engineer to learn it. Similarly,\nyou do not have to know theoretical physics to master the seas. Mariners\ndo know physics, of course—practical physics about load balancing,\nfor example—but they do not have to know how to derive the\nequations that describe it.\nWhat I am saying here about the shipping industry holds true for\nevery other area of life as well. Twenty-first-century skills are no different\nfrom 1st-century skills. Interestingly, Petronius, a 1st-century\nRoman author, complained that Roman schools were teaching “young\nmen to grow up to be idiots, because they neither see nor hear one\nsingle thing connected with the usual circumstances of everyday life.”\nIn other words, schools have always been about educating the elite in\nthings that don’t matter much to anyone. This is fine as long as the\nelite don’t have to work.\nBut today the elite have extrapolated from what they learned at\nHarvard and decided that every single schoolchild needs to know the\nsame stuff. So, they whine and complain about math scores going\ndown without once asking why this could possible matter. Math is not\na 21st-century skill any more than it was a 1st-century skill. Algebra\nis nice for those who need it, and useless for those who don’t. Skill\nin mathematics is certainly not going to make any industrial nation\nmore competitive with any other, no matter how many times our “experts”\nassert that it will. One wonders how politicians can even say\nthis junk, but they all do.\nWhy?\nMy own guess is that, apart from the fact that they all took these\nsubjects in school (and were probably bad at them—you don’t become\na politician or a newspaper person because you were great at calculus),\nthere is another issue: They don’t know what else to suggest.\nThinking about the 1st-century will help us figure out what the\nreal issues are. People then and people now had to learn how to function\nin the world they inhabit. This means being able to communicate,\nget along with others, function economically and physically,\nand in general reason about issues that confront them. It didn’t mean\nthen, and doesn’t mean now, science and mathematics, at least not for\n95% of the population.\n208 Teaching Minds\nHow do we choose who studies the elite subjects? We don’t.\nOffer choices. Stop making lists of what one must know and start\nputting students into situations where they can learn from experience\nwhile attempting to accomplish goals that they set out for themselves,\njust as people did before there were schools. Education has\nalways been the same: learning from experience with help from wiser\nmentors. School has screwed that all up and it is time to go back to\nbasics.\nSo the “what” question is simple. We should teach children what\nadults know that enables them to function in the world they inhabit.\nThis has much less to do with academic knowledge than it has to do\nwith practical, and often subconscious, knowledge of how to do a variety\nof things in the social and physical and economic world we have\ncreated.\nNow let’s address the question of how to teach these things.\nJohn Dewey noted, in 1916, that he had been talking about learning\nby doing for a long time, but nobody ever listened to him about\nit—which was exactly his point. He was frustrated about changing the\nsystem. In 1916! Imagine how he would feel today.\nIt is not unreasonable to ask why the system never changes, and\nwho is making sure that it won’t change. The answer is obvious. So\nmany people have vested interests in things staying as they are that\nthe system basically cannot change—at least not of its own free will.\nThe President of the United States could help make the changes\nneeded, but he won’t. Here is a piece from then-Senator Obama’s\neducation speech given during his campaign in Dayton, Ohio, in 2008:\nWe will help schools integrate technology into their curriculum\nso we can make sure public school students are fluent in the\ndigital language of the 21st-century economy. We’ll teach our\nstudents not only math and science, but teamwork and critical\nthinking and communication skills, because that’s how we’ll\nmake sure they’re prepared for today’s workplace.\nSome advisor of his had read my writings and was quoting me on that\none. I usually say reasoning and not critical thinking, but this is taken\nfrom my many speeches on education. And what has the President\nactually done? He said in that same speech:\nWhat Can We Do About It? 209\nAnd don’t tell us that the only way to teach a child is to spend\nmost of the year preparing him to fill in a few bubbles on a\nstandardized test. I don’t want teachers to be teaching to the\ntest. I don’t want them uninspired and I don’t want our students\nuninspired.\nUh huh. Did he change No Child Left Behind? No. Of course not. Testing\ndominates education as much as it ever did. All presidents are the\nsame, really. They can’t fight the vested interests, or won’t. I will avoid\nfiguring out why here, although, once again, John Dewey had much\nto say on the subject of how governments stay in power by making\nsure that people aren’t really educated.\nWe can’t count on politicians, but here is what we can do. We can\nbuild it and then we can work inside or outside the system in such a\nway that allows people to be able to come.\nBut how do you build a new high school system? Very simple: one\ncurriculum at a time. The trick is making sure that you put the curricula\nonline. We cannot change education one school at a time. Many\ngood schools have been created over the years. Today, John Dewey’s\nLab School (in Chicago), which was entirely a learning-by-doing place,\nis now a college prep school. Having a few reasonable schools will not\nchange the system. A curriculum offered online is available to everyone\nand eventually can provide an alternative to a system that offers\nboring and mindless education.\nIn addition, online means choices. Once we create dozens, maybe\nhundreds, of curricula from which to choose, students should be\nable to learn anything they want to learn without regard to whether\na teacher for that curriculum or other students interested in that curriculum\nhappen to live nearby.\nSo, in an ideal world, what would these curricula be about?\nThey can be about anything that one can learn to do in the real\nworld (which would leave out all the traditional academic subjects).\nThey should teach teaching cognitive processes, of course, but one\nshould not endeavor to teach cognitive processes specifically, that is,\napart from their possible use. So, it is the use of these processes in\nsome area of real life that would be the intent of any full-year, storycentered\ncurriculum.\nThese curricula and any others that we would design have the\nfollowing characteristics:\n210 Teaching Minds\n1. They must be learn-by-doing curricula consisting of series of\nprojects inside coherent stories about life in some aspect of\nthe real world.\n2. They must be delivered on the web. Students should work on\nprojects where the background and help are web delivered.\nThey would submit their work to mentors and receive\nfeedback online.\n3. Mentors in the curricula would include parents, online\nsubject matter experts worldwide, local experts, and teachers\ntrained to be mentors. Mentoring, unlike teaching, is not\nabout providing information that can be found easily in\nbooks but about helping students through a problem without\ngiving them the answer. Mentors point students in the right\ndirection and react to their work as it progresses.\n4. Students should, on a regular basis (sometimes weekly,\nsometimes more often), submit work products related to each\nproject for evaluation and feedback. Students would submit\ntheir work many times to achieve increasing mastery and get\ncontinuing feedback. There should be no competency tests,\nonly the continual monitoring of performance.\n5. Each curriculum should be designed by a panel of experts in\na given field. The curriculum should provide a simulation of\nwhat life might be like in that field. For example, students\nmight spend the year working legal cases, or starting a\nbusiness, or designing roads and bridges.\n6. Students should be encouraged to work in virtual teams,\nlearning to deal with others to produce results.\n7. Choice must be a staple of the curricula. There can be no\nsingle set of standard requirements. Instead, students should\nbe able to select the curricula they wish to participate in.\nTheir records would list what deliverables they have created\nin their chosen curricula.\n8. Curricula must be designed around projects with clear,\nmeaningful, achievable goals. They must be designed\ncarefully so to incorporate all the key basic skills like reading,\nwriting, reasoning, researching, calculating, computing, and\nso on, in a systematic and natural way.\nWhat Can We Do About It? 211\nHere are some curricula that have been proposed that would meet student’s\ninterests head on, that would be able to teach them to be good\nat a variety of skills (including all 12 cognitive processes), and that\nwould make the students employable as well:\n• Criminal Justice\n• Sports Management\n• The Music Business\n• The Legal Office\n• Military Readiness\n• The Fashion Business\n• Aerospace Engineering\n• Computer Networking\n• Homeland Security\n• Medical Technology\n• Construction\n• Computer Programming\n• Television Production\n• Real Estate Management\n• Architecture\n• The Banking Industry\n• Automotive Engineering\n• Architecture\n• Biotechnology\n• Film Making\n• Travel Planning\n• Financial Management\n• Parenting and Childcare\n• Starting an Online Business\n• Urban Planning\n• Hotel Management\n• Health Sciences\n• The Food Industry\n• Graphic Arts\n• Communication\n• Veterinary Science\n• Marketing\n• Telecommunications\n• Scientific Reasoning\n212 Teaching Minds\nObviously, this list could be much longer. The intention here is to\nmake any student excited about learning because what he or she wants\nto learn about is offered. The trick for the designers of the curricula is\nto make sure that students’ interest is grabbed and maintained for a\nfull year, while teaching them how to hone their capabilities at the 12\ncognitive processes.\nWhat are the obstacles?\nWhat would prevent this from happening? Really there are only\nfour issues:\nFinding people who know how to build the curricula\nPaying the people who will build the curricula\nConvincing schools or other entities to offer the curricula\nTraining teachers to be mentors in these curricula\nSmart, articulate, people who are well organized and can write\nwell can easily learn to do the bulk of the work involved in building\na course as long as they have access to experts and are guided by\nexperienced designers, and the project is run by someone how knows\nhow to run projects. Finding people who can do this work is not a\nproblem. Being able to pay them for the year or so that it takes to do\nthe work is the real issue.\nThis leads us to discuss who would pay for this. The answer should\nbe the federal government, but it is clear that that will never happen.\nThe federal government, as any interested citizen knows, is influenced\nmightily by big business, especially when big business has profits to\nprotect.\nCompanies that produce textbooks and companies that produce\nand grade exams will not stand by and see their revenues drop. Any\nalternative curriculum that did not use textbooks and did not use\nstandardized tests would be anathema to them. Companies that have\nbillions of dollars in revenues from textbooks know how to encourage\npoliticians to protect their interests.\nWhat about the testing industry? A recent report says that “the\ntesting industry is somewhat secretive.” I wonder why. But sometimes\nthey do report revenue. To give an example, the revenue of Kaplan\nInc., which is just one of many test preparation companies, was over\n$1 billion in 2008. Who owns Kaplan? The Washington Post. So while\nthe testing companies make great profits, the nation’s newspapers,\nhaving a vested interest in those profits, tout testing as the country’s\nWhat Can We Do About It? 213\nsalvation. The most visible touter is the Secretary of Education, who\ngives eloquent speeches about more rigorous testing that are, of course,\nprinted in The Washington Post.\nWhy would President Obama want to do the same thing as President\nBush did, especially when he campaigned against No Child Left\nBehind, as I pointed out earlier? The answer is simple. There is lots of\nmoney invested in testing by powerful players. Kids are no one’s main\nconcern.\nSo the money for the new plan will not be coming from the\ngovernment.\nWhat about from business? Venture capital, for example?\nIs a new kind of high school offered online likely to be a successful\nbusiness venture? One mentor in the story-centered curriculum can\nhandle between 20 and 50 students, depending on the mentor’s experience.\nAssuming that the students pay tuition that covers the mentor’s\nsalary, which means they need to pay at least $3,000 a year, more\nor less, in tuition, it shouldn’t cost anything to run. Charge larger tuitions\nand there will be profits. Initial investment is about $2 million\nto build a curriculum, but enough students paying reasonable tuitions\nwill pay that investment back quickly enough. So, is this a big business\nopportunity?\nActually I doubt it. I think that it is a big opportunity for universities\nthat traditionally charge large tuitions. We have had a great deal\nof success with master’s degrees, for example. But universities typically\ndon’t invest $2 million in anything, even if it does have great upside\npotential. When Carnegie Mellon University made that investment in\nits West Coast campus (where I was designing the curriculum), it did\nso without quite knowing it was doing so because the person in charge\ndidn’t tell the University officials what he was up to. Universities typically\ndon’t think about investing money in order to make money in\nthe daily enterprise. Businesses do think that way, of course, but businesses\nhave trouble starting universities that are accredited. I worked for\nTrump University, which supposedly was going to do exactly that, but\nthey never could raise enough money or figure out how to be accredited.\nSo there is a potentially very big business in master’s degrees, but\nit needs some well-financed and prescient people to make it happen.\nHigh schools are another story. I actually do not believe that business\nwill invest in online high schools whose mission is to overthrow\nthe existing system. Venture capitalists are not revolutionaries. They\ntend to follow the herd in whatever they do and there is no herd in\n214 Teaching Minds\neducation except the one promoting more testing. They certainly do\ninvest in that.\nSo we are left with appealing to people who actually care about\nkids and their education. Money isn’t and shouldn’t be the allure here.\nThis means that the saviors of education will have to be wealthy individuals\nor foundations started by wealthy individuals.\nThe health sciences curriculum that we built was funded by the\nEwing Kauffman Foundation. We built it using our not-for-profit company,\nEngines for Education. I really believe that no alternative to the\nnonprofit model funded by wealthy people exists. We just have to find\npeople who care about education. They are in short supply, and they\ntypically aren’t the wealthy people who make pronouncements about\neducation, but I am hopeful that they are out there.\nI wouldn’t mind being wrong about anything I have said here. The\nfederal government could get taken over by people who actually care\nabout kids and not votes.\nHow do we convince schools to offer these curricula once they\nhave been developed? It won’t be easy. There aren’t that many schools\nrun by people who realize that the system is broken. But they do exist,\nhowever. The real problem is not so much convincing the head of\na private school or the superintendent of a school district. It is more\nabout convincing parents who fundamentally do not understand education,\nor teachers who have taught what they have always taught and\nreally don’t want to learn new skills.\nAnd, in addition, there are all those state standards. The first thing\nthat any school that wants to use our curriculum has to do is to see\nhow they can map what we will teach into their state’s standards. If\nthe state standards specify 2 years of algebra, we are out of luck. If\nthey have vague science standards, we are in better shape. Either way,\nthe state standards, passed by all those brilliant state legislatures that\nknow all there is to know about what should be taught in high school,\ninhibit real change in the system.\nSo we need motivated heads of schools or school systems, in states\nthat have flexible standards, where parents who hold views about why\nschool was better in their day do not have to be listened to. Do these\nexist?\nSure.\nThe last issue is training teachers to mentor. We do this by having\nteachers be students in a curriculum mentored by others who have\nexperience in that curriculum. Mentoring does not come naturally to\nWhat Can We Do About It? 215\npeople who have been teaching in the usual way. But they pick it up\nand often find that they like it better.\nHere is Lynn Carter, one of the first mentors we trained to teach\nin this new way at CMU’s West Coast campus. He is a professor of\nsoftware engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.\nIt has taken me a while to figure out how to undo about 25 years\nof teaching experience that was standing in front of a room and\ntalking, but I really like it. I enjoy interacting with students. As\nmuch as I enjoy standing in front of students and talking, it is\nmuch more satisfying to be dealing with smaller groups, more of\na one-on-one interaction.\nProfessors often complain that no students come to see them\nduring their office hours. That isn’t a problem with us here.\nHow did we teach Professor Carter to mentor Socratically? It wasn’t\ntrivial to do, but it didn’t take that long either. Once a teacher gets\nthe idea that his job is not telling but helping, he gets into the swing\nof it fairly easily. Training teachers to teach in the kinds of SCCs we\npropose for high school is more an issue of familiarizing them with\nthe content, which will differ considerably from what they have been\nteaching. Handholding comes naturally to most people because they\nhave been doing that kind of teaching all their lives with siblings and\nchildren. Lecturing is not a natural human activity and teachers are\neasily dissuaded from doing it as long as they are not being presented\nwith a classroom of listeners.\nIn the end, the real question is this: Why do we still have schools?\nThis is a little like asking why we still have religious institutions.\nIn fact, it is a lot like asking that question because you will get the\nsame reactions. People get used to the institutions that have always\nbeen a part of their lives. The fact is that these institutions were created\nin a different time when knowledge was harder to come by and\nthe economy was quite different.\nReligion is not my issue. Should we still have schools?\nInstead of answering this question by listing all the good things\nthat schools provide—no one would argue that a literate population\nis a bad thing, for example—I will turn the question around: What is\nbad about having schools?\nHere is a list of what is bad. Following the list, I will explain what\nis bad about these things (assuming it isn’t obvious).\n216 Teaching Minds\nSchools emphasize competition.\nSchools make kids stressed.\nSchools know the right answers.\nSchools enable bullying and peer pressure.\nSchools stifle curiosity.\nSchools choose the subjects for students.\nSchools have classrooms.\nSchools give grades.\nSchools provide certification.\nSchools confine children.\nSchools claim that academics are the winners.\nSchools do not value practical skills.\nSchools cause students to want to please teachers.\nSchools cause students to question their self-worth.\nSchools are run by politicians.\nGovernments use education for repression.\nDiscovery is not valued in school.\nBoredom is seen as a bad thing in school.\nCompetition: Why should school be a competitive event? Why do\nwe ask how a kid is doing in school? Learning in life outside of school is\nnot a competitive event. We learn what we choose to know in real life.\nStress: When 6-year-olds are stressed about going to school, you\nknow that something is wrong. Is learning in real life stressful? Stress\ncan’t be helping kids learn. What kid wouldn’t happily skip school on\nany given day? What does this tell us about the experience?\nRight answers: School teaches that there are right answers. The\nteacher knows them. The test makers know them. Now you have to\nknow them. But in real life, there are very few right answers. Life isn’t\nmathematics. Thinking about how to behave in a situation, planning\nyour day or your life, plotting a strategy for your company or your\ncountry—no right answers.\nBullying and peer pressure: You wouldn’t have to have say no to\ndrugs or cigarettes campaigns if kids didn’t go to school. In school there\nare always other kids telling you how to dress, how to act, how to be\ncool. Why do we want kids’ peer groups to be the true teachers of\nWhat Can We Do About It? 217\nchildren? Being left out terrorizes children. Why do we allow this to\nhappen by creating places that foster this behavior?\nStifling of curiosity: Isn’t it obvious that learning is really about\ncuriosity? Adults learn about things they want to learn about. Before\nthe age of 6, prior to school, one kid becomes a dinosaur specialist,\nwhile another knows all about dog breeds. Outside of school, people\ndrive their own learning. Schools eliminate this natural behavior.\nSubjects chosen for you: Why algebra, physics, economics,\nand U.S. history? Because those subjects were pretty exciting to the\npresident of Harvard in 1892. And, if you are interested in something\nelse—psychology, business, medicine, computers, design? Too bad.\nThose subjects weren’t taught at Harvard in 1892. Is that nuts or\nwhat?\nClassrooms: If you wanted to learn something and had the\nmoney, wouldn’t you hire someone to be your mentor, and have\nthem be there for you while you tried out learning the new thing?\nIsn’t that what small children have, a parent ready to teach as needed.\nClassrooms make no sense as a venue for learning unless, of course,\nyou want to save money and have 30 (or, worse, hundreds of) students\nhandled by one teacher. Once you have ratios like that, you have to\nteach by talking and then hoping someone was listening, so then you\nhave to have tests. Schools cannot work as places of learning if they\nemploy classrooms. And, of course, they pretty much all do.\nGrades: Any professor can tell you that students are pretty much\nconcerned with whether what you are telling them will be on the\ntest and what they might do for extra credit. In other words, they\nwant a good grade. If you tell them that 2 + 2 = 5 and it will be on\nthe test, they will tell you that 2 + 2 = 5 if it means getting a good\ngrade. Parents do not give grades to children and employers do not\ngive grades to employees. They judge their work and progress for sure,\nbut not by assigning numbers to a report card.\nCertification: We all know why people attend college. They do so\nprimarily to say they are college graduates so they can get a job or go\non to a professional school. Most don’t care all that much about what\n218 Teaching Minds\nhoops they have to go through. They do what they are told. Similarly,\nstudents try to get through high school so they can go on to college.\nAs long as students are not in school to get an education, you can be\npretty sure they won’t get one. Most of our graduates have learned to\njump through hoops, nothing more.\nConfined children: Children like to run around. Is this news to\nanyone? They have a difficult time sitting still and they learn by trying\nthings out and asking questions. Of course, in school sitting still is the\nnorm. So we have come up with this wonderful idea of ADHD, that\nis, drug those who won’t sit still into submission. Is the system sick or\nwhat?\nAcademics viewed as winners: Who are the smartest kids in\nschool? The ones who are good at math and science, of course. Why do\nwe think that? Who knows? We just do. Those who are good at these\nsubjects go on to be professors. So those are certainly the smartest\npeople we have in our society. Perhaps they are. But I can tell you from\npersonal experience that our society doesn’t respect professors all that\nmuch, so something is wrong here.\nPractical skills not valued: When I was young, there were\nacademic high schools and trade high schools. Trade high schools\nwere for dumb kids. Academic high schools were for smart kids. We\nall thought this made sense. Except that are a lot of unemployed\nEnglish majors and a lot of employed airplane mechanics. Where\ndid we get the idea that education was about scholarship? This is not\nwhat Ben Franklin thought when our system was being designed, but\nhe was outvoted.\nThe need to please teachers: People who succeed at school are\ninvariably people who are good at figuring out what the teacher\nwants and giving it to her. In real life there is no teacher to please\nand these “grade grubbers” often find themselves lost. When I did\ngraduate admissions, if a student presented an undergraduate record\nwith all A’s, I immediately rejected him. There was no way he was\nequally good at or equally interested in everything (except pleasing\nthe teacher). As a professor, I had no patience for students who\nWhat Can We Do About It? 219\nthought that telling me what I just told them was the essence of\nacademic achievement.\nSelf-worth questioned: School is full of winners and losers. I\ngraduated number 322 in my high school class (out of 678). Notice\nthat I remember this. Do you think this was good for my self-esteem?\nEven the guy who graduated number 2 felt like a loser. In school, most\neveryone sees themselves as a loser. Why do we allow this to happen?\nPoliticians in charge: Politicians demand reform but they wouldn’t\nknow reform if it hit them over the head. What they mean is that\nschool should be like they remember rather than how it is now, and\nthey will work hard to get you to vote for them to give them money\nto restore the system to the awful state it always was in. Politicians,\nno matter what party, actually have no interest in education at all. An\neducated electorate makes campaigning much harder.\nGovernment use of education for repression: As long as there have\nbeen governments, there have been governments that wanted people\nto think that the government (and the country) is very good. We all\nrecognize this tendency in dictatorships that promote the marvels of\nthe dictator and rewrite history whenever it is convenient. When you\npoint out that our government does the same thing, you are roundly\nbooed. We all know that the Indians were savages that Abraham\nLincoln was a great president and that we are the freest country on\nearth. School is about teaching “truth.”\nDiscovery not valued: The most important things we learn we\nteach ourselves. This is why kids have trouble learning from their\nparents’ experience. They need their own experiences to ponder and\nto learn from. We need to try things out and see how they go. This kind\nof learning is not valued in school because it might lead to, heaven\nforbid, failure, and failure is a really bad word in school. Except failure\nis how we learn, which is pretty much why school doesn’t work.\nBoredom ignored: Boredom is a bad thing. We drug bored kids\nwith Ritalin so they will stop being bored. All of my best work has\ncome when I was most bored and let my mind wander. It is odd that\n220 Teaching Minds\nwe keep trying to prevent this from happening with kids. Lots of TV,\nthat’s the ticket.\nMajor learning by-doing mechanism ignored: And last but not\nleast, scholars from Plato to Dewey have pointed that people learn\nby doing. That is how we learn. Doing. Got it? Apparently not. Very\nlittle doing in schools. Unless you count filling in circles with number\n2 pencils as doing.\nOnline education can change all this. Build it right once and children\nthe world over will have the opportunity to learn how to think and to\nlearn how to work. Such a system would be capable of changing fast.\nAny new industry or market or technology could produce a course in\nwhat is needed to work in that field and instantly get the people it\nneeded.\nSchools are an ancient artifact that can’t last much longer.\nNotes\nChapter 1\n1.
