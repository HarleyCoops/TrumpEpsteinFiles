    "full_text": "﻿CNN – CNN Today\nNew Tariffs — Trade War\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn, September 18, 2018\nHOST: Robert Lawrence Kuhn\njoining us via skype from Beijing.\nHe's the author of How China's\nLeaders Think and a longtime\nadvisor to Chinese leaders and\ncorporations. Robert, we appreciate\nyou joining us. First off, you know it\nseems like Trump's strategy here is\nto force China into concessions with\nthese tariffs. What's China's view\non that?\nRLK: China's view is that the\neconomic ties between China and\nthe rest of the world, the United\nStates in particular, is very\nimportant for the peace and\nprosperity of the world.\nRLK: And indeed for the entire\neconomic relationships and\nstandards of living of all people.\nThere are real issues and I think we\nneed to discuss them. But right\nnow, China is sending signals by\nwhat it's doing, that it wants to\nratchet down the trade war. It\nrecognizes that it cannot be\nunresponsive.\nRLK: In China, the legitimacy of the\ngovernment and indeed of the\nCommunist Party is based upon two\ncardinal factors. One is the\neconomy. This is the 40th year of\nChina's reform and opening up —\ntruly an economic miracle, an\nastonishing increase in standards of\nliving.\nRLK: The GDP per capita has gone\nup more than 50 times in these 40\nyears. And so that's number one.\nBut number two is national\nrejuvenation, national pride. This is\nwhat the government and the Party\nhas brought to China in terms of its\nposition in the world. So it cannot\nback down and look weak in terms\nof these tariff attacks. But given\nthat, given that environment, the\nChinese response is very carefully\ncalibrated.\nRLK: China levying tariffs on $60\nbillion is not dollar for dollar, the\nway the first $50 billion was. But\nwhat it is, in fact, is in proportion —\nbecause $60 billion is roughly 40\npercent of the roughly $150 billion\nof the total US exports to China,\njust as $200 billion is roughly 40\npercent of the little over $500\nbillion of the total China exports to\nthe US.\nRLK: So it's a\nproportional\nresponse.\nThe rhetoric\nin the press\nis also\nmilder. US\nhas not been\ncalled so\nmuch of\nbullying\nanymore.\nAlso some of\nChina’s\ntariffs are 5\npercent as\nwell as 10\npercent,\nwhereas the\nUS tariffs are\nall 10\npercent\n[going up to\n25 percent].\nSo China is\nsending a\nsignal that it\nwants to\nratchet this\ndown.\nHOST: So, if China is sending these\nsignals then, Robert, is there a\nchance that China would actually\ncome to the table and continue to\nhave these trade talks as they've\nbeen scheduled for the coming\ndays?\nRLK: Unlikely that the top trade\nnegotiator would come under these\ncircumstances, because then it\nlooks like they're coming under the\nthreat of a gun to their head, an\nanalogy that has been used.\nPossibly that a lower level\ndelegation would come. It's\nunlikely though that we'll see any\nreal movement before the midterm\nelections.\nRLK: I think there has to be some\nbackchannel working. To put the\nreal situation on the table, there are\nfive major issues that the US is\nconcerned about in addition to the\ntrade deficit. The trade deficit is\nactually complicated because there\nare services of $40 billion dollars\nthat Chinese tourists and students\npay. It's not excluding the transfer\npricing of components that are\nshipped into China. So the trade\ndeficit, which benefits a lot of\nAmerican consumers with cheaper\nproducts at a good quality is not as\nrelevant as popular opinion would\nsuggest.\nRLK: Most experts do not really\nfocus on the trade deficit. American\nexperts focus on five things: the\nlack of open Chinese markets;\nintellectual property protection,\nindustrial espionage, including\ncyber theft; tech transfer being\nforced (in joint ventures);, and\nChinese government subsidies for\ncritical technologies or industries.\nRLK: If we look at these, China's\nmaking real progress in intellectual\nproperty, reducing cyber theft —\nmore needs to be done. Not\nrequiring tech transfer. The big one,\nwhich they won't change, is\ngovernment subsidy for nascent\ntechnologies of the future. Such\ngovernment-industry cooperation is\npart of the Chinese system — that's\nbeyond their red line.\nRLK: But China should be able to\nopen their markets — and we\nshould be able to have a trade\nbetween seriously open markets,\nwhich even Chinese economists say\nis good for the Chinese economy\nand very good for the world and\nAmerican companies — and some\nsort of a recognition that China will\ncontinue to subsidize industries.\nThat's where it will happen, we\nhope soon.\nHOST: Yeah. So then if there is\nroom for a trade deal from an\nexpert like you, that there's room\nfor both sides to agree to a deal\nthat would benefit both the United\nStates and China. How would you\nadvise President Trump in terms of\nhis tactic and how he should\napproach China?\nRLK: You know, I am not going to\nbe an expert in advising President\nTrump on tactics. I'm not sure he's\namenable to advice and he has his\nown style.\nRLK: And many people in the US —\nlet’s put it on the table — who\ndisagree with Trump on virtually\nevery other policy — support\nTrump either overtly or quietly on\nhis approach to China. And that's\nbecause there's general recognition\nin the US — from Bernie Sanders\nDemocrats all the way on the left to\nthe rightwing Republicans all the\nway on the right who favor Trump\n— that something needs to be done\nto alter the US trade relationships,\nand the US’ overall relationships,\nwith China.\nRLK: So Trump recognizes that and\nhe is getting political credit for that\n— whether people like it or not.\nThere's unlikely to be anything\nbefore the midterms, but if\nPresident Trump is doing what he's\ndoing, he needs to recognize that\nthese issues that I articulated are\nreally the critical issues. And China\nwill be willing to make changes on\nthem. They've already made\nchanges on many of them, like on\nintellectual property rights, as I\nsaid\nRLK: . But if Trump can recognize\nwhat is really needed and what\nChina will do, then Trump can get a\nhuge win out of this, which is\nactually at the same time beneficial\nto China. That's a small needle hole\nat this point though which to look.\nBut I think, ultimately, that's what\nwill happen.\nHOST: Robert Lawrence Kuhn,\nthank you very much for your\nexpertise. I appreciate it.\n"
