[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: hey \nImportance: High \nJ. or Jeff or Jeffrey, \nHope things are going well for you. \nI finally finished trimming down my collection from 700 pages to 400, \"60 Years of Investigative Satire: The \nBest of PK.\" The piece below is the last one in the book. You've previously seen the first half \nEnjoy, \nPaul or Zen Bastard or Rumpleforeskin \nAlternative Facts \nBetween the choice of a one-man-one-vote (Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia) and fake news of Weapons \nof Mass Destruction, invasion of Iraq, and horror of ISIS, George Bush was elected president in the year 2000. It \nwas due to the electoral college (a rigged system which originally intended to prevent slaves from voting and \nevolved to gerrymandering), even though Bush's opponent, Al Gore, won the national popular vote. \nHillary Clinton was elected senator that year, and she announced that the first thing she would do was to get rid \nof the electoral college. A few years later, as a columnist for the New York Press, I sent her a letter asking about \nthe status of that promise. She didn't reply. \nOn November 8, 2016, a crooked businessman, liar extraordinaire, bragging pussy-grabber, make-America-\nwhite-again, anti-choice, anti-Semite, fake Christian, climate-change hoaxer, twitter addict, homophobic, \napprentice politician, friendly fascist, and Vladimir Putin's \"useful idiot,\" namely Donald Trump, who was \nelected as an insanely narcissistic dictator based on the electoral college, whereas his opponent, Hillary Clinton, \nwon the national popular vote by \"more than three million\" individuals. \nIrony lives. \nBut an incredibly cruel monster inadvertently awakened a sleeping population to counteract the essence of evil \nwith love, laughs, and law, fueled by the aid of true news. Incidentally, Putin had 88 journalists murdered. No \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030871 \nwonder Trump told him, \"It's an honor to be with you.\" Now Putin wanted new Obama's sanctions on Russia to \nbe reprieved. \nNational Security Adviser Michael Flynn had discussed it with the Russian ambassador a month before Trump \ntook office. Although General Flynn joined his campaign and shared criminal secrets, he denied them to the FBI. \nIt was a felony offense. The Justice Department warned Trump that Flynn had misled Mike Pence, and that Flynt \ncould be vulnerable to blackmail. Trump asked Flynn to resign, and yet he offered his job back when he got out \nof prison. Why? Because Flynt was the scapegoat, taking the fall for the president and vice-president. He preferred \na trial with immunity since they knew. Pence said Flynt lied and that itself was a lie. \nIf Trump and Pence were both to be kicked out of the White House, the next in line would be the Speaker of the \nHouse, Paul Ryan. Steve Bannon has described him as \"a limp-dick motherfucker who was born in a petri dish at \nthe Heritage Foundation.\" It takes one to know one. Indeed, Bannon said he wanted to destroy Ryan. \nHallelujah! \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030872 \n"
