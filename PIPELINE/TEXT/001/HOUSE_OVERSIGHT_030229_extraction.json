In no circumstances should such payment be conditional on the \noutcome of a trial. \n*iii) Any payment or offer of payment made to a person later cited to \ngive evidence in proceedings must be disclosed to the prosecution and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030229 \ndefence.

If, despite payment, no public \ninterest emerged, then the material should not be published. \nRoss Gow \nManaging Partner \nACUITY Reputation Limited \n23 Berkeley Square \nLondon W1J 6HE \nMobile \nTel \nacuityreputation.com \nSent from my iPad \nOn 10 Mar 2011, at 16:41, GMAX \n> wrote: \nActually school means university in the states.

The billionaire, 58, is a friend of Prince Andrew, right \nIn one left for her or 'Sarah', a caller says she 'doesn't know at what time she must come this night for the massage'. \nOther messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, contain such phrases as: 'She has females for Mr JE' and 'I have a \nfemale for him'. \nAnother with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: 'He just did a good one — 18 years. (She spoke \nto me and said, \"I love Jeffrey\")'. \nThe long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends including the business magnate Donald \nTrump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and magician David Copperfield, referred to as 'Magic David'. \nThe sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein's massages, many of which were 'erotic' and allegedly \ninvolved the abused girls. \nThe evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into Epstein and seen yesterday by the \nMail. \n<image.png> \n<image.png> \nLogs: Two of the answer phone messages. Miss Maxwell is asked, right, when a girl should give a massage \nOne message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.' \nIt was left in February 2005 — the same year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted police to Epstein's abuse. \nAnother note shows that 'Colleen' phoned to tell Epstein: 'Going into class — will be out in 45 min.' \nLast night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers are included in the logs. \nOne girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about Epstein. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030231 \nA man listed only as Darren said: 'I have no comment to make on that.' \nToday, Prince Andrew was embroiled in further controversy as it was revealed Kazakhstan had asked for his help in recruiting \ninvestors to the country. \nThe plea came after the former Soviet Republic's President's son-in-law had bought the Prince's former marital home for \n£3million above the asking price. \nTimur Kulibayev paid £15million for Sunninghill Park but it has remained empty and has been allowed to fall into disrepair. \nLast year the Prince told Hello! magazine: 'It was like any property deal between friends.' \nYesterday he attempted to perform business as usual as he visited an East London school and met rail bosses in Canary Wharf. \nHe steadfastly ignored questions from journalists asking whether he was an 'embarrassment to his country' and would resign \nfrom his trade ambassador role as he arrived for a briefing from business executives at the headquarters of the £15billion train project \nCrossrail. \nPrince Andrew managed to sell Sunninghill Park for £3million more than the asking price \nRead more: <http://www.dailymail.co.uldnews/article- 1364171/Females-Jeffrey-Ep stein- The-damning-telephone-\nlo g.html#ixzz1GBL6XKcI> http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article- 1364171/Females-Jeffrey-Epstein-The-damning-telephone-\nlog. html#ixzz1GBL6XKcI < <hftp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article- 1364171/Females-Jeffrey-Epstein-The-damning-telephone-\nlog. html> http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article- 1364171/Females-Jeffrey-Ep stein- The-damning-telephone-log.html> \nFrom: Ross Gow [ \nSent: 10 March 2011 7:48 AM \nTo: Ross gow \nCc: Ian Maxwell; Kevin Maxwell; Brian Basham; Gareth Thompson; \nSubject: Daily Mail \nMail have published phone logs \n<http://www.dailymail.co.uldnews/article- 1364171/Females-Jeffrey-Epstein- The-damning-telephone-log.html> \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article- 1364171/Females-Jeffrey-Epstein-The-damning-telephone-log.html < < \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article- 1364171/Females-Jeffrey-Epstein-The-damning-telephone-log.html> \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article- 1364171/Females-Jeffrey-Epstein-The-damning-telephone-log.html> \nRoss Gow \nManaging Partner \nACUITY Reputation Limited \n23 Berkeley Square \nLondon W1J 6HE \nMobile \nTel \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030232 \n<http://acuityreputation.com> acuityreputation.com \nSent from my iPad \nOn 10 Mar 2011, at 07:35, Ross gow <acuityreputation@gmail.com \n> wrote: \n\"Epstein's Gulfstream flew in to RAF Marham with him and the Duke's friend Ghislaine Maxwell on board, before they enjoyed \nthe Duke's hospitality at the Queen's Norfolk estate 20 miles away....\" \nRoss Gow \nManaging Partner \nACUITY Reputation Limited \n23 Berkeley Square \nLondon W1J 6HE \nMobile \nTel \nacuityreputation.com < <haw,/ acuityreputation.com> http://acuityreputation.com> \nSent from my iPad \nOn 9 Mar 2011, at 22:52, Ross Gow \n> wrote: \nDear Ghislaine \nThank you for your good-humoured patience with us and the legal team today, during what is, understandably, a testing time. \nTo confirm: \n1) I spoke to Dilenschneider in NYC at length tonight and shared strategy and role defmition. \n2) we sent agreed statement to Dan Mangan ay NYPost - he's on deadline for a piece on Charlie Sheen/Rob Lowe and seems to \nhave moved on - for the moment. \n3) we will release statement via Press Association and PR Newswire @11.00GMT tmrw and follow up with calls to those \njournalists who have written pieces. \nWe will create call log/matrix and advise feedback and sentiment as appropriate tmrw.
