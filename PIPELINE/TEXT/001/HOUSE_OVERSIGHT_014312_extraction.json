Yes, banks/financials \nmight pull back at some point after this run-up but we would be buyers on any pullbacks and we continue to see further \nupside from multiple expansion and earnings growth. Our analyst raised her price targets by —11% across the board. The \nlong term rotation from bonds and div stocks into sectors like financials is only beginning. \nVol is higher on the week; what prices well now: \nBuy the XLF March 2017 $22 call with $26 Knock-Out (continuous) for $0.87, with a full premium \nrebate if knock-out occurs. \nThis prices attractively given flat call skew and if XLF breaches $26 and this knocks out, at least you get your \npremium back. \nPlease find our Financials report attached. \nFuture of Financials conference hosted 90 public and private companies at our Future of Financials conference. We are \nraising our price objectives across most of our names. Three primary reasons why we think there is upside remaining \nafter the recent rally: 1) an improved outlook on both activity levels and interest rates, driving revenue upside; 2) \npotentially lower regulatory burden, particularly as new supervisory leadership can come with the new administration; \nand 3) relatively lighter positioning in US financials vs. other sectors.

Funds are underweight financials in all regions, valuations are \nreasonable, earnings are improving and financials tend to outperform when bond yields rise. \nVol is higher today — refreshed pricing below. \nBuy an XLF 17March2017 call spread: \n• Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in \n• Total premium: 1.86% \nGlobal Positioning in Stocks: Nigel Tupper notes the 4000 funds in our \"Positioning in Stocks\" analysis  \nare more underweight Financials, on average, than any other sector and are underweight this sector in all \nregions of the world. If earnings continue to improve and yield rise, which is often the case in an upturn in our \nGlobal Wave, then the unloved Financials sector has the potential to continue to outperform. \nGlobal Quant Panorama: \"Bearish on Bonds\" stocks (which tend to move in the opposite direction to  \nbond yields) tend to outperform our \"Bullish On Bonds\" when bond yields rise. The sectors that tend to \nperform best as bond yields rise are Energy, Tech, Materials, Banks, and Diversified Financials. Of these \nsectors, the laggards this year have been Banks and Diversified Financials. With a PE of 15.9x and a PB of \n2.0x, Global valuations are reasonable. Also, Risk is near all-time lows in terms of PE in most regions. Now \nthat macro and earnings data have triggered the beginning of a rotation, Value becomes very relevant. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014312 \nFrom: Ens, Amanda \nSent: Friday, November 11, 2016 4:04 PM \nTo: 'jeffrey E.'; 'Richard Kahn' \nSubject: Financials trade for Monday \nIt's not too late to buy financials as a medium term trade. They've run up a lot this week but we're getting \nendless calls from generalists asking which banks to buy — there is still more upside to the sector. Banks also \nprovide some offset to your bonds if interest rates continue to move. Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF \ncould have another 20-25% upside given its many levers to the Trump trade: less regulation, higher interest \nrates/steeper yield curve, higher vol, economic growth, etc. The regional banks are asset sensitive and more of a \npure play on a rates move but we view the larger cap banks as having even more upside to the Trump Trade \ngiven the above points. \nBuy an XLF 17March2017 call spread: \n• Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in \n• Total premium: 1.75% \nAll eyes are on Sunday's 60 Minutes interview with Trump. Market is pricing that all regulations will be rolled \nback (very optimistic). Any hint that this is not true could lead to pullback on Monday. \nNote on tech: we're seeing FANG used as a source of funds with the rotation from growth into value. There's \nalso the tax read-through: tech is already relatively tax advantaged @ 22%; Industrials are at 30%, Financials at \n29%. Next year, tech could benefit from a repatriation tax holiday but that is viewed as more of a Q1/Q2 trade. \nMore thoughts on financials: \nWith respect to the economy, the market is certainly indicating that there will be a large fiscal stimulus which \nmay send US growth higher and that's a good thing for financials for a wide variety of reasons, from \nemployment to wages to loan growth and credit quality (even if somewhat offset by higher rates). It does \nremain to be seen exactly how much of this expected policy actually gets done, but at the moment, investors are \nwilling to take a certain amount of growth on faith. \nSo those are positives for financials before we even discuss regulation. The move in the financials since the \nelection would seem to indicate that investors have concluded that nearly every piece of financial regulation \nwill get put into a shredder on day one of the new administration. The incoming administration has fueled that \nwith comments about rolling back pieces (or more) of Dodd-Frank in particular. I can see making the case for \nthat to the American public by saying that banks need less regulation in order to get more capital flowing into \nthe economy to drive growth. Not only does that mean that the E is likely too low (meaning that the P/E is not \nas high as it seems) but it could help improve ROE's as well which could increase the multiple of that higher E \ninvestors are willing to pay. Note that while ROEs could go higher, it's unlikely that they can get back to the \npeaks... \nRegards, \nAmanda \nAmanda Ens \nDirector \nBank of America Merrill Lynch \nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated \nOne Bryant Park, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10036 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014313 \nThe power of global connectionsTm \nBankofAmerica<s-ss-40* \nMerrill Lynch \nThis message, and any attachments, is for the intended recipient(s) only, may contain information that is \nprivileged, confidential and/or proprietary and subject to important terms and conditions available at \nhttp://www.bankofamerica.com/emaildisclaimer.
