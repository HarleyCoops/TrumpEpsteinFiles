I also think print has \nmuch more impact than TV. Talk to Lionel and Robert while you're there -- they are the two guys who can \nmove the needle on this. And let's do more in print when you get back. In fact, Matt Zames and I spent an hour \nand a half with WSJ's Kate Kelly from the Journal on this issue for a major story she's doing on the Obama \nproposal. Let's have you quoted in that. \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Jes Staley \nTo: Joseph Evangelisti; \nSent: Thu Jan 28 04:56:55 2010 \nSubject: \nDaley and frankel are saying that I need to go on TV (CNBC) to defend our hedge funds.
