I \nrealize you don't have much control over this, but you can at least help me to move. I can't just get up and go like you. I left the \ncity to escape, make a better life and I am devastated these people found me and brought to light an association of that I would \nrather them never to know. People think I was involved with something really bad and I lost a boyfriend of great potential over \nthis shit. I am still in debt over all these years, been working my ass off trying to get ahead, which you could never understand I \nwas even surviving off the pay I was getting. Well, its not any better. I dropped out of college because of you (and GM's) advice. \nStarted working for a company you wanted me to and basically my life has has become hell since then. \nI have been your supporter for 16 years, the media explosion with Clinton, Trump and Cosby is affecting me.
