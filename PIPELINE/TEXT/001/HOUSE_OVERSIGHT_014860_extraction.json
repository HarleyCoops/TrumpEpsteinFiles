Our BofAML Bull & Bear Indicator is now at 7.1, the highest level since Jul'14 \nand not far from \"sell\" signal. So is this just a pause for breath in the reflation trade? BofAML strategists \nthink so. In our updated thoughts this morning we think reflation is real so stay long equities, short rates, \nselectively long USD (click here). \nChart 12: BofAML B&B Indicator (scale from 0 to 10) \n13mdt \nFeb.16 lows \nToday \n10 \nExtreme Extreme \nBearish Bullish \nSource BotA Merniloynch Global Investment Strategy \nWhy do we remain bullish the reflation trade? \nThe main reasons for equity investor concern in recent weeks = the gap between hard and soft data, plus \nthe delay in the Trump fiscal package \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014860 \nChart 1: The gap between hard and soft data is a concern to investors Chart 2: Mediocre US Q1 data partly down to seasonal adjustments \nResidual seasonality in GDP growth from 1985 to 2015 \n25 \n2 \t08 \n15 \t06 \n1 \n04 \n05 \u000b0 \t02 \n-0 5 \t0 \n-1 \n-1 5 \t-0 2 \n-2 \t-0 4 \n-2 5 \u000b01 \t00 01/02 01104 01/06 0108 01/10 \t01/12 01/14 01/16 \t-0 6 \n-0 8 \n—Surveys & Business Cycte Indicators \t—Hard Data \n-1 \nScs,oce SoM Mend Lynch Glcbal Research Bloortf-ri \n01 \nSource Cleveland Federal Reserve \n• GDP \n• Pnvate Investment \n• Government consumptron & investment \n02 \n03 \n04 \nWe continue to believe in the reflation theme because: \n1. Strength in the global economy is genuine - European PMIs are at 6 year highs, Chinese and \nJapanese PMIs continue to improve too. In fact —90% of PMIs globally are above 50 and 60% have \nincreased in the last 3 months. \n2. Earnings revisions and Global Wave point to continued upturn - earnings revisions now \nabove 1.0 for the first time since 2011. \n3. We expect Trump to deliver on tax, even if it is smaller than hoped for - should such a \npackage be put together it would likely support the Trump trade once again after the failure to reform \nObamacare \n4. Bond markets are being too sanguine about the likely pace of Fed tightening - the Fed \nfunds curve is once again well below the dot plot. We continue to see upside in yields if and when the \nmarket becomes more convinced that the soft data is right. \nChart 7: Bond yields have pulled back from FOMC highs \n2.7 - \n2.5 \n2.3 \n2.1 \n1.9 \n1.7 \n1.5 \n1.3 \nfAINA \nCO CO CO CD GO tO CD CO CO CO CO CO N.- N.-\n—UST 10y yield \nC 9.4. 5, 1 .7 3-3 <-81A \nSource Btoombero \nChart 8: As the market refuses to price the dot plot \n250-\n200 - \n150 \n100 - \n50 \n1 \n0 \n—Current market pncmg \nMedian dot.

This conflicts with our latest Fund Manager Survey which suggested allocation to \nEuropean Banks fell the most of any sector MoM in the first two weeks of March, however, its true \nEuropean Banks have quickly reversed the performance gap to US peers. The spread between the SX7E \nand S5BANKX Index is back to pre-US election levels. \nWhat the EU banks bulls are saying: \nEUR rates are going higher it's just a matter of timing, positive EPS revisions continue, EU is starting to \nsee pockets of volume growth and asset yield recovery, credit spreads have been tightening YTD and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014861 \nattractive valuations of EU banks vs. US peers (EU banks on 12.0x 2017E PIE vs. US Banks on -14x and \nsome EU banks still on a large discount vs 10-year historical median P/B valuations). \nWhat the EU banks bears are saying: \nEU macro declining, US lead re-flation trade cooling (tax, deregulation, healthcare headwinds) and toppy \nmultiples/high ownership of EU banks going into Q1 results. They believe the pressure will be off Draghi to \nact on the deposit rate if the macro starts to reverse which may cause people to push back the assumed \ntiming of European rate hikes and tapering. The French election is also a big risk factor which is clearly \nholding back some global investors from buying into Europe. \nRates Update \nConsensus has started to factor in the higher rate outlook in Europe. The bears are pointing out that these \nprobabilities have fallen a lot this week while the bulls argue it's just a matter of timing. \nI monitor market expectations for ECB normalisation in rates using the World Interest Rate Probability \n(WIRP) function on Bloomberg. It's been very volatile recently. I currently see the market is pricing a \n16.6% probability of a EUR rate hike before the end of 2017 (row 6, column 2 below). a 32.7% probability \nin the next 12 months (row 9, column 2) and a 67.6% probability in the next 18 months. \nEi Ir.-. \n• Instrument \n3 Future Implied Probability \nCurrent Implied Probabilities \n1) Overview \nOIS: Eurozone OIS - Deposit F( \nDates o Meeting \tCalculation \nMeeting \tProb Of Hike \tProb of Cut \n04/27/2017 \t0.0% \t2A' \n06/08/2017 \t0.0% \t3.3% \n07/20/2017 \t2.1% \t3.2% \n09/07/2017 \t7.2% \t3.1% \n10/26/2017 \t8.8% \t3.0% \n12/14/2017 \t16.6% \t2.8% \n01/25/2018 \t21.6% \t2.6% \n03/08/2018 \t29.4% \t2.3% \n04/26/2018 \t32.7% \t2.2% \n06/14/2018 \t41.4% \t1.9% \n• Historical Analysis for Meeting \n:17/2017 \n) Add \nikal ted \n-0.6 \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n• Current Rate -0.40 \n,•2 rates \nIn Based on rate -0.40 \n.)-1 '07/2017 \n-0.5 \n2.4% \n3.3% \n3 2% \n3.1% \n3.0% \n2.7% \n2.6% \n2.3% \n2.2% \n-0.4 \n97.6% \n96.7% \n94,6% \n89.7% \n88.2% \n80.6% \n75.8% \n68.2% \n65.1% \n•4) Add/Remove Series \n-0.3 \t-0.2 \tBPS• \n0.0% \t0.0% \t-0.2 \n0.0% \t0.0% \t-0.3 \n2.1% \t0,0% \t-0.1 \n7.1% \t0.1% \t0.4 \n8.6% \t0.2% \t0.6 \n15.6% \t1.0% \t1.5 \n19.6% \t1.9% \t2.1 \n25.4% \t3.7% \t3.1 \n27.5% \t4.8% \t36 \n32.5% \t7.8% \t5.0. \nAs a reminder our research team estimate that euro area banks could see as much as €26bn in earnings \nuplift from a return of ECB rates to zero. This would represent a 25% uplift to profits - a big prize when it \nhappens (click here for report). \nWhat to buy in banks if you share our view on sustained reflation? \nWe remain positive on banks that can make acceptable returns in the current environment and are geared \ninto the upside when rates begin to recover... ING, KBC, Intesa, Unicredit, SocGen, Erste, BKIR are \nall Buy rated. \nTop picks: \nBuy Soc Gen, PO C55 \n• Still fourth worst performer in the SX7E YTD due to French election overhang. \n• Yet reported a strong set of Q4 results, beating on P&L, capital and dividend which comforts our \nview that the stock is set for re-rating. \n• Continues to tick a number of boxes offering a dividend yield of 5.1% in 2017E, an attractive \nvaluation of 0.79x 2017e TNAV, solid capital position and has strong EPS momentum. \n• Our EPS (2017 and 2018) is 10% above consensus with further upside from CIB, Russia recovery \nand Corporate Center \n• Stronger capital position allows for growth (organic and bolt-on M&A) \nBuy Intesa, PO C2.80 \n• On NPEs, capital, profitability, operating trends, and cash payouts, Intesa stands above other \nItalian banks in our view. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014862 \n• ISP will pay a dividend (confirmed) equivalent to an 8.0% yield vs. a 4.0% European banks \naverage and on our estimates \n• Italian banks are trading at a PNAV discount to ISP but their profitability is half that of ISP's and \ntheir capital is lower \n• ISP retains the lowest (gross/net) Italian NPE ratio and in 4Q16 NPE were down yoy by 8% \ngross/10% net. \n• Shares have suffered from the uncertainty related to a possible tie-up with insurer Generali - still \nthe seventh worst performing bank in the SX7E YTD \nAlso remain very bullish on market exposed Nordic banks \nThis morning we reiterate our preference for Nordic banks (click here for report) with more market \nexposed revenues and reiterate our Buy ratings on Danske Bank, Nordea, DNB and SEB ahead of Q1 \nresults. We expect to see good fee /trading income in Q1 on the back of strong AUM and continued high \nactivity levels. \nThe relative P/E premium of Nordic banks vs. the sector is now 7% vs. a long term average of 11%. We \nalso note that Nordic banks are expected to continue to deliver close to 4% better ROTE (2017-19E) and \nhave a lower beta. \nChart 1: Danske Bank remains best capital return story (Capital buffers as `)/0 of market cap) \n300 \n200 \n100 \n00 \n208 \n69 \n13.8 \n11.0 \nDANSKE SHBA \n10.8 \t10.8 \t10.4 \t10.3 \n5.8 \t6.4 \t6.1 \t6.0 \n4.9 \tZIEN \nSEBA \tNDA \tDNB \tSWEDA \nBuffer 17E Divi + Buyback (not yet executed) Buffer + Dii + Buyback (not executed) \nSource.
