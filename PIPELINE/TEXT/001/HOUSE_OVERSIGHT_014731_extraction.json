The world has changed. Possibly irrevocably so.\nThese ground shifts have been brought on by a backlash to globalization, increasingly\nviewed as the culprit for wage stagnation (Chart 1), growing disparity of income and\nwealth between the rich and the poor (Chart 2), and the loss of national identity. We\nsuspect the trend of anti-globalization is here to stay.\nChart 1: US real median household income\nChart 2: Income inequality and globalization\n60,000\n58,000\n56,000\nChina entered\nWTO\n23\n22\n21\n20\n54,000\n52,000\n50,000\n19\n18\n17\n16\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n48,000\n1981\n1983\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2015\n46,000\n1981\n1983\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2015\nshare of aggregate income going to top 5 percentile (%, LHS)\nimport/GDP (%, RHS)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nWide-ranging consequences for financial markets\nIn our view, the anti-globalization theme will have at least seven major consequences\nfor financial markets in 2017.\n1. Monetary easing will give way to fiscal easing\nThe history of populism is one of fiscal largesse. Furthermore, with limited scope for\nfurther monetary easing, fiscal easing is becoming the last and only resort for\npolicymakers. It seems reasonable to assume that the combination of these two factors\nwill soon usher in a period of easier fiscal policy.\nNowhere will the impact of fiscal easing be felt more than the US in 2017, in our view.\nThe GOP has achieved a rare clean sweep in the latest elections. During the 18 years\nthat a single party controlled both the Presidency and Congress since 1965, US\nstructural budget balance as a share of potential GDP deteriorated by 0.4pp a year on\naverage (Chart 3). In other words, history tells us that a clean sweep is usually a recipe\nfor fiscal stimulus. The GOP has the additional incentive to use fiscal easing to boost\neconomic growth ahead of the mid-term elections in 2018. The Republicans will need to\npick up at least eight more seats in the Senate to accomplish their stated objectives of\nrepealing Obamacare and Dodd-Frank (Chart 4). We think the Republican controlled\nCongress will use the reconciliation process (which has a deadline of 15 April) to pass\nmost of its fiscal agenda into law.\n2. Fiscal easing not yet priced into the belly of the curve\nFiscal easing is unlikely to be kind to the Treasury market. For one thing, a bigger\nbudget deficit would increase risk premium. And, fiscal easing at this late stage of the\nexpansion would likely lead investors to demand higher inflation risk premium. Also,\n2 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nChart 3: Change in structural budget balance /potential GDP (pp)\nChart 4: Number of Senate seats up for grab in 2018\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.4\n-0.5\nClean sweep\nDivided government\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nDemocrats Republicans Independent\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nfiscal easing will likely place pressure on the Fed to normalize rates more quickly when\ninternal dissent against near zero rates is growing.\nUS rates have backed up quickly after the election, driven largely by a repricing of\ninflation expectations. With long-term inflation breakevens closing on their historical\naverages (Chart 5), we think the next phase of the rates move will be led by the belly of\nthe curve. The market is only pricing in a one and a quarter rate hike in 2017, and\nanother one and a quarter hike in 2018, with Fed Funds futures implying that the Fed\nFunds rates will be only at 1.25% at the end of 2018 (Chart 6). We think the 5y part of\nthe curve offers the best risk-reward trade-off for investors with a 3-6 month horizon to\nposition for a more aggressive Fed. As our leading indicator section suggests, global\ngrowth momentum is set to pick up in Q1, also supporting this view.\nFor investors with a 1-3 month horizon, we would recommend shorting 10y real rates.\nThis trade would benefit from higher rates in general, but more importantly, would also\nbenefit from a sudden risk-off that could render vulnerable reflation trades that have\ngone a very long way since 9 November. This trade would also benefit from a grand\nbargaining that stabilizes long-term debt dynamics, cuts waste and supports investment\nand growth.\n3. USD/JPY will the main beneficiary of Trump win\nWhile the US fixed income sell-off will likely continue to spill over to other bond\nmarkets, yield differentials are likely to move in favor of the USD. This will be especially\nChart 5: US 10y inflation breakeven (%)\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n2.4\n2.2\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n1/7/2010 7/7/2011 1/7/2013 7/7/2014 1/7/2016\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nChart 6: Implied Fed Funds rates in 24 months (%)\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n1/1/2010 7/1/2011 1/1/2013 7/1/2014 1/1/2016\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 3\nChart 7: Cumulative Japanese purchases of foreign bonds since 2010\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n-100\n1/1/2010 7/1/2011 1/1/2013 7/1/2014 1/1/2016\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nChart 8: USD/JPY 10y forward outright\n100\n95\n90\n85\n80\n75\n70\n65\n60\n55\n50\n1/1/2010 5/1/2011 9/1/2012 1/1/2014 5/1/2015 9/1/2016\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\ntrue against the JPY given the Bank of Japan is pegging 10y JGB yields at zero. We are\ncognizant of the possibility that the willingness of Japanese investors – who have\nalready bought record amount of US bonds this year – to buy more is likely to be\nconstrained by their recent losses (Chart 7). However, with long-dated USD/JPY forward\noutrights near their lowest levels in more than a year, further purchases are more likely\nto be currency unhedged (Chart 8). This is why we would recommend buying USD/JPY\neven after the big rally of the past week.\nMore generally, the USD is likely to benefit from repatriation of overseas US corporate\nearnings, which is highly likely, in our view, given that it is the lowest hanging fruit in\nWashington for the new administration.\n4. MXN is oversold but BRL faces more headwinds\nUntil the US election, EM fixed income was the best performing asset class in 2016,\nbenefiting from the decline in rates in core markets as well as the rebound in global\ngrowth. The combination of higher US rates and higher USD over the past week has\nnearly wiped out its YTD gains. However, long positions remain crowded (Chart 9) and\nliquidity conditions are poor. For these reasons, we think downside risk remains and\nwould recommend selling a basket of Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian long bonds.\nSome EM markets have already seen brutal capitulation. In particular, MXN has priced in\na lot of bad news, even though it is not clear that the net impact of Trump policy is\nnegative for Mexico. In contrast, the BRL remains one of the most crowded EM\nChart 9: EM fixed income performance vs. positioning\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, EPFR Global\nChart 10: BRL/MXN\n8.5\n8\n7.5\n7\n6.5\n6\n5.5\n5\n4.5\n4\n1/3/2011 1/3/2012 1/3/2013 1/3/2014 1/3/2015 1/3/2016\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n4 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\ncurrencies. The fact that the Central Bank of Brazil will be looking to cut rates in the\nface of a Fed tightening cycle makes the BRL especially vulnerable in 2017. We would\nrecommend buying MXN against BRL as a relative value trade.\n5. The best hedge against escalation of trade friction\nThe rise of populism means that policies will become less predictable and less market\nfriendly. This should be especially true in the area of international trade. Even though a\ntrade war is not our central scenario, the risk of trade friction will likely be much greater\nthan anything we have seen in recent years.\nFor Donald Trump’s trade policy to work he needs a weak USD. Meanwhile, with\nincreased concerns about the long-term ill effect of debt-fuelled expansion, Beijing\nseems to have become resigned that China needs a weaker RMB (Chart 11). This could\nset the US and China on a collision course in 2017. To hedge against the possibility of\nan escalation of trade tension between China and the US, we would recommend buying\na 10 delta USD call/CNH put that would benefit from either an increase in risk premium\nor an acceleration of renminbi depreciation between now and the inauguration of the\nnew US president on January 20 (Chart 12).\n6. Contagious populism will benefit the GBP\nBrexit and the election of Donald Trump could help bolster nationalistic and antiglobalization\nparties elsewhere by lending legitimacy to their causes. With major\nelections coming up in France, Holland and Germany next year and the possibility of\nearly elections in Italy, investors will be on tenterhooks, as anti-globalization movements\ncould further undermine public support for the European project at a time that the\nEurozone is still recovering from the peripheral crisis.\nIt is not our central scenario that right wing parties will take power in any of these\ncountries next year. However, after the surprise victories of the Brexit camp and Trump,\ninvestors are likely to demand greater risk premium ahead of these votes. We think this\ncould lead to further reversal of the rally in EUR/GBP this year and would recommend\nselling the cross at the current level.\n7. Not all reflation trades are born equal\nReflation trades have skyrocketed since the US election. Commodities, mining stocks,\ncommodity currencies, and inflation indexed bonds generally have outperformed.\nHowever, we would caution against the indiscriminate buying of inflation-linked assets,\nas the general theme is not supported by fundamentals in all inflation-linked markets.\nEurozone 10y20y inflation breakeven has jumped over the past week to 1.96%, near the\nyear’s high, but more importantly, approaching the ECB’s “below but close to 2%”\nChart 11: RMB trade weighted basket\n106\n104\n102\n100\n98\n96\n94\n10/1/2015 1/1/2016 4/1/2016 7/1/2016 10/1/2016\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nChart 12: EUR/GBP spot\n0.95\n0.9\n0.85\n0.8\n0.75\n0.7\n0.65\n1/1/2010 7/1/2011 1/1/2013 7/1/2014 1/1/2016\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 5\ntarget. It is possible that Trump’s election could weaken fiscal discipline in the Eurozone\nover the medium term, but we are more concerned by the non-trivial risk that the ECB\nmay disappoint in the December meeting by either not extending quantitative easing\n(QE) beyond next March or announcing tapering prematurely. We like selling 30y\nbreakeven.\nOur commodity team expects OPEC to agree on production cuts on November 30. This\nshould help support oil prices and the currencies of oil producers like Russia. With the\nelection of Trump, the probability has increased that there could be some sanction relief\nfor Russia under the new US administration. RUB has the additional advantage of\noffering the highest real rates in EM right now. Given our bullish view on the USD, we\nwould recommend selling EUR/RUB.\nTop 10 Rates, EM & FX trades for 2017\n1. Short US 5y rates – Two and a half Fed hikes priced by the rates market for\n2017-18 are not consistent with aggressive fiscal easing promised by Trump.\n2. Short US 10y real rates – After the violent repricing of inflation breakevens,\nreal rates offer better risk-reward to position for higher rates.\n3. Buy USD/JPY – With the BOJ pegging 10y JGB yields at zero, we expect this\nhighly interest rate sensitive USD cross will continue to be the biggest\nbeneficiary of the Trump win.\n4. Sell a basket of Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian long bonds – Positioning\nin EM fixed income market remains crowded while liquidity is poor.\n5. Sell BRL/MXN – MXN is oversold but BRL will be vulnerable to the divergent\npaths between Brazil’s easing and the Fed’s tightening cycles.\n6.

Sell Eurozone 30y inflation breakevens – We think investors should take\nadvantage of the recent rally to sell into the December ECB meeting, which\ncould disappoint.\n9. Sell EUR/RUB – Likely OPEC production cuts on November 30 and possible\nsanction relief for Russia are bullish for the RUB, in our view.\n10.

Short 10y US real\nrates offers the best risk-reward after recent moves.\nUS rates back in the driver seat\nAfter three years of being the sideshow, US rates are back. The US rate outlook in no\nsmall part will drive the FX and EM outlook for 2017. Our strongest medium-term\nconviction on a Republican sweep was higher US rates (Mind the Sweep, 31 Aug 16).\nThat conviction remains steadfast: US rates are headed higher to start 2017. But, this is\nnot the time to be foolish – 5y and 10y rates have seen a 5 standard deviation move\nover the last week. So we recommend a near-term trade (bearish 10y real rates) that\nhas the least to lose if the reflation theme unwinds while capturing most of the upside\nfrom a bearish move. Our medium-term directional view goes with the flow of recent\nprice action: short 5y rates, long USDJPY and short basket of LatAm long bonds. Here\nwe make the compelling case that recent moves have a lot further to go.\nBearish 5y yields for the medium term\nOur bearish energy in US rates for 2017 will largely be focused on the 5y point of the\ncurve. Despite the recent move, we see three clear reasons why the market still has to\nplay catch-up from now, at least until inauguration day:\n1. Comeback chart of 2017: market vs dots\nWe prefer short 5y rates over the widely held view of short 30y rates given we think\nthat fiscal stimulus will move the Fed before it shows up in fundamentals. We believe\nthe Fed’s current dot projections will move from being a ceiling to a floor on the market.\nIn this case, intermediate forwards like the 3y1 and 4y1y have the most room to sell off,\nleaving the 5y point most vulnerable, (Chart 13). Our fair value framework indicates that\nif the market were to revert to the dots, 2y rates can move higher by 26bp, 3y rates by\n45bp, 5y rates by 57bp and 10y rates by 48bp.\nChart 13: After three years of treating the dots as a ceiling, they will\nsoon act as a floor for the market, in our view\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\nDec-16 Jun-17 Dec-17 Jun-18 Dec-18 Jun-19 Dec-19\nOIS implied FF target\nFOMC median\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nChart 14: Additional deficit needs are likely to be financed by increasing\nfront-end auction sizes\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\n2y 3y 5y 7y 10y 30y\nChange in auction szies from the peak in 2010 ($bn)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 7\n2. Learning from Japanese fiscal stimulus\nUltimately, fiscal stimulus is not the long-term answer to flat curves or low neutral rates\n(Japan being the prime example). Fiscal stimulus merely captures some low-hanging fruit\nthat extends the business cycle by a couple of years and provides the central bank an\nopportunity to get further away from the ZLB. Said simply, fiscal stimulus raises the\nterminal rate in the current business cycle while doing little for the long-run neutral rate\n– this by definition should be more bearish for intermediate rates than 30y rates.\n3. Additional deficit issuance\nWith the average maturity of UST debt already standing at record highs (70months),\nTreasury showing an inclination to cut long-end issue sizes in 2016, and the supply\nshortfall in the front end of the UST curve post MMF reform, we also believe that the\nUS Treasury will finance the increased deficit using the belly of the UST curve as\nopposed to the long end\nTrade: We recommend a 3m5y OTM payer 25 delta, strike = 2.05% for a gross\npayoff ratio of 3.4: 1. See the Best Vol Trades section for more details and risks.\nBut focus on being short real rates now\nAfter spending much of 2016 successfully being long real rates, we recommend\nswitching to a real rate short for 2017. We think the consensus was too slow to get on\nthe real rate train and is now too long relative to benchmark. As described in the detail\nhere, fiscal stimulus is likely to leave government and private companies competing for\na shrinking pool of savings, driving the real cost of debt higher. We highlight three\nreasons why short real rates provides better risk-reward now (Chart 15).\n• Anti-globalization = higher real rates: Few appreciate that one of the biggest\nbeneficiaries of globalization has been US real rates. Globalization was undoubtedly\ngood for EM growth and reserves. As these reserves found their way back into the\nUS, US real interest rates were held lower. As the global savings glut unwinds, real\nrates have the most room to re-price. Chart 16 offers compelling proof.\n• Risk parity unwind = higher real rates: Exposure to any heightened concern about\na risk parity deleveraging trade in a high vol environment is best found in asset\nclasses where their footprint is large relative to market liquidity. TIPS is a prime\nexample of one such asset class. The influence of a multi-asset strategy on real\nrates is clear from Chart 17.\n• Lower rates = lower breakevens: If the recent euphoria unwinds, it is likely due to\na 1) RMB deval; 2) commodity collapse post OPEC; or 3) equity market correction.\nChart 15: Real rates vs. breakevens: A real\nshort offers better risk reward than nominal\nshort\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\nJan-15\nApr-15\nJul-15\nOct-15\nJan-16\nApr-16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nJul-16\nOct-16\n5y5y breakevens (LHS)\n5y5y real rates\n0.8\n0.3\n-0.2\n-0.7\n-1.2\nChart 16: Foreign official holdings of UST vs.\nreal rates\n600\n400\n200\n0\n-200\n-400\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n-1.25\n-0.75\n-0.25\n0.25\n0.75\n1.25\n6m change in foreign official holdings of USTs\n(LHS, $bn)\n6m change in 30y real rates (RHS, inverted\nscale, %)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, US Treasury\nChart 17: BAML multi asset strategy index vs\nreal rates\n590\n580\n570\n560\n550\n540\n530\nJun-13\nDec-13\nJun-14\nDec-14\nJun-15\nDec-15\nJun-16\nMLMAST1 Index (L1)\nUSGGT10Y Index (R1)\nDec-16\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nThe BAML multi asset strategy index is not representative of all\nrisk-parity funds.

Risk: A reflationary sell-off without re-pricing the Fed is a risk to\nthe trade.\nFX: GOP sweep emboldens core USD/JPY view\nHigher US real rates, higher intermediate (5-10y) nominal rates combined with a\npotential USD tailwind from a second Homeland Investment Act (HIA), leave USD/JPY as\nour top directional FX trade for 2017. We have maintained a core view that USD/JPY\nwould move higher in 2017, as the factors weighing on the pair this year, namely\nspeculative JPY buying and increased FX hedging by domestic investors ($/¥’s eventual\nsurge), would subside. We like the trade for the following reasons.\n• USD/JPY most sensitive to fiscal-stimulus-driven rise in US yields: Of all G10\nFX pairs, JPY is most vulnerable (versus the USD) to a fiscal-driven rise in US yields.\nFirst, the pair’s correlation with rate differentials is the highest in G10 at 60%. But,\nmore importantly, USD/JPY is also the most sensitive to the shape of the US 2s10s\ncurve (Chart 18). The shift from loose monetary/tight fiscal to a tight monetary/\nloose fiscal policy regime will support such a steepening as supply is concentrated\nin the intermediate part of the curve, and the positive growth shock allows the Fed\nto hike faster, supporting an increase in real yields, also a key 2017 call.\n• BOJ yield target is bearish for JPY: The BOJ’s implementation of a yield target at\nits September meeting has caused a break in the correlation between 10Y JGBs and\nUSTs (Chart 19). First, given USD/JPY’s significant correlation with 10Y yield\ndifferentials (>60%), the anchoring of 10Y yields will further weigh on the Yen as\nUS Treasury yields rise. Second, further Japanese fiscal stimulus will successfully\nlower real yields through higher breakeven rates of inflation while nominal yields\nwill remain unchanged. As our JPY strategist argues, to the extent that a Trump\nvictory has weakened Abe’s diplomatic success, not least from likely TPP failure,\nand residual macro uncertainty makes it increasingly likely the government will seek\nto draft a supplementary budget sooner than anticipated.\n• HIA and domestic flow picture a JPY-negative: The flow picture also turns JPYnegative\nin 2017.

In our view, Mexico,\nBrazil and Colombia (longer duration low spread foreign currency bonds) are especially\nvulnerable, while the higher yield and lower duration of lower quality and shorter EM\nbonds will be more defensive. A review of the taper tantrum (May 2013) shows that: 1)\nEM underperformed UST at the start; 2) BBB sovereigns underperformed the most, and\nhad not yet recovered in a year; and 3) BB and B-rated bonds recovered to beat USTs 8-\n10 months later. This time, we expect a sharp selloff with an eventual recovery.\nOur bearish view on LatAm credits in particular is driven by 1) positioning in LatAm is\nheavier than in EMEA or Asia – watch outflows from IG crossover investors who will\nrethink their EM IG investments; 2) their exposure to commodities and 3) vulnerability to\na potential decline in US trade. Our choice of the basket is fairly obvious - Mexico is\nclearly the most vulnerable to NAFTA and a decline in remittances, uncertainty on the\npace of the economic recovery and debt dynamics are extremely challenging in Brazil\nwhile tax reform delays could mean a credit rating downgrade in Columbia.\nTaking account of both oil and US rates as independent variables, a regression analysis\nshows that a 100bp Tsy backup would be related to 30-45bp wider spread (Chart 22).\nNote that residuals show spreads are currently about 35bp too tight.\nThe trade: Sell equally weighted basket of Mex 47s, Brazil 45s and Colom 44s\nCurrent average yield: 5.74%, annual carry & roll 30bp; target: 6.35%; stop: 5.25%\nOn a portfolio basis for benchmark real money investors, we recommend moving out of\nlong higher quality LatAm, leaving higher yielding shorter bonds.

One transmission channel is\nthat turning points usually anticipate monetary policy changes. The most reliable leading\nindicators available summarize a battery of activity, financial and qualitative variables.\nOne example is the set of Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) calculated by the OECD,\nwhich is heavily used by policy makers and market participants.\nThe problem that we have with leading indicators is they are not really useful to market\nparticipants because they move after the market does. That is, leading indicators\nanticipate growth but not the market because they use financial variables to anticipate\ngrowth. Leading indicators rely heavily on interest rates, stock market indexes and\nexchange rates because they incorporate vast information quickly.\nLILI solves the problem in two dimensions. It is not based on financial variables. Rather,\nLILI is based on qualitative data, consumer and business confidence, which we believe\nare optimal to capture “animal spirits.” And, it is constructed explicitly to anticipate the\nCLI, as we use a dynamic forecasting regression with lags of consumer and business\nconfidence to calculate LILI.\nThe signal for early 2017\nLILI indicates that in early 2017 global growth will continue with an improving economic\noutlook (Chart 23). Consumers and firms seem to be bullish around the world, because\nLILI anticipates an even stronger outlook than the CLI. Here global growth means\ngrowth in the OECD plus the six largest non-OECD members. LILI anticipates the CLI by\nfour months, and the CLI in turn anticipates growth by three months.\nLILI supports our house view of higher rates and reflation, as the peak of the business\ncycle is not in the forecasting horizon. Since LILI is not based on market measures, we\nare confident that LILI anticipates market movements as well.\nChart 23: LILI is our leading indicator of leading indicators that leads growth by 7 months and OECD’s CLI by 4 months\n103\n101\n99\nOECD + 6 LILI\n97\nOECD + 6 CLI\nOECD +6 growth\n95\nJan-06 Jan-08 Jan-10 Jan-12 Jan-14 Jan-16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, OECD. Note: OECD + 6 includes the 33 OECD member countries plus the largest 6 non-OECD members: Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 11\nThe nuts and bolts of LILI\nWe used the OECD database of monthly economic indicators to look for non-financial\nvariables that could anticipate the CLI. We use small and simple forecasting regressions,\nas they sometimes adjust more quickly to structural changes than large regressions or\nregressions based on large data sets. And, we already have a big-data leading indicator,\npublished in our Year Ahead a year ago. We looked only at models with two independent\nvariables (and their lags) and with variables of the same “type” (production variables, or\nemployment variables, or confidence indicators). Further research can be done to use\nmodels that mix variables, although those models are more difficult to interpret.\nWe used two criteria to select between models. One was Granger-causality tests, which\namount to joint tests that the lags of the independent variables are statistically\ndifferent from zero in our dynamic regressions. The other was the Bayesian Information\nCriteria (BIC), a measure that looks at the fit of the regression (the r-squared) but that\npenalizes large models. We found that production measures and confidence indicators\nusually performed better in our training sample (1980 to 2014), although confidence\nmeasures usually had a larger lead. The model that used has a lead of four months and\nuses up to four lags of the standardized consumer confidence indicator (CCI) and of the\nstandardized business confidence indicator (BCI) calculated by the OECD. Many models\nshowed similar performance, which indicates that a combination strategy could be\nfruitful, although we did not take that route. No out-of-sample tests were performed.\nWe like LILI because it can anticipate the OECD’s leading indicator without the use of\nfinancial variables. But we also like it because it is easy to interpret as it is based on\nconfidence indicators and because those indicators are not subject to data revision,\nunlike variables such as GDP or payrolls.\n12 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nBest Inflation Trades\nMark Capleton\nMLI (UK)\nmark.capleton@baml.com\nDavid Beker\nMerrill Lynch (Brazil)\ndavid.beker@baml.com\nSebastien Cross\nMLI (UK)\nsebastien.cross@baml.com\nAthanasios Vamvakidis\nMLI (UK)\nathanasios.vamvakidis@baml.com\nInflation party starting but Eurozone not invited\n• Eurozone breakevens have benefited from US move, but we see its sub-target\nproblem becoming more entrenched. Sell OATei 2047 vs OAT 2066\n• FX pass-through considerations and the prospect of firmer oil prices and leave us\nfavoring breakevens in Thailand and Mexico.\n• We expect inflation divergence in G10 economies. Our analysis of inflation and\ndeflation risks support buying USD/JPY and selling CHF/SEK.\nRising Eurozone breakevens – the triumph of hope over experience?\nThe rally in Eurozone breakevens and inflation swaps looks mild compared with the\nrecent US experience, for obvious reasons, but it has still been meaningful. The widely\nfollowed 5y5y has rallied from a 1.25% low to 1.58% and the 10y20y forward rate is at\n1.96% (which qualifies as meeting the ECB’s ‘below but close to 2%’, we’d say, albeit\nwithout the inflation risk premium we were used to in the past).\nIt is hard to argue with what looks like a beta-weighted response to the US move,\nperhaps. After all, there is a global component to inflation and if the US is driving that\nnow, then Eurozone inflation expectations should firm, it can be argued. And if we are in\nfor a Reaganomics-style fiscal stimulus, then it is quite possible that we will get the\ndollar strength associated with that experience; if so, the Eurozone might get to import\na little inflation by being on the other side of that currency move.\nHowever, we are somewhat troubled by the fact that the inflation options market has\npriced out the risk of deflation almost completely (Chart 24). Has that threat really been\nextinguished? Yes, inflation expectations have risen but the rise in real yields has also\ntightened monetary conditions and there remains the threat that in December the ECB\nfails to commit to ongoing stimulus on a sufficient scale to satisfy markets that it can\nreturn inflation to target.\nChart 24: Euro inflation expectations rally; long term forward at target,\n%\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n5y5y\n10y20y\nChart 25: Perceived deflation risk goes; 5y ZC 0% inflation floor price, c\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 13\nChart 26: The Euro HICP – weighted index proportions recording\ninflation below 0% and above 2%\nChart 27: Eurozone member country inflation rates, with bubble sizes\nproportionate to index weights\n70\n1.2\n60\n1.15\n50\n1.1\n40\n1.05\n30\n1\n20\n0.95\n10\n0\n99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n>2% <0%\n0.9\n0.85\n0.8\n-1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2\nSource: Eurostat, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nSource: Eurostat, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nCore inflation at 0.8% is barely above the 2015 low of 0.6%. One statistic that often\ngrabs attention is the high proportion of HICP index components recording deflation\n(currently 31% on a weighted basis). However, much of this represents volatile non-core\ncomponents so is less of a concern. The bigger problem is the fact that even after we\ntake out all these components recording deflation, the 69% of the index remaining is\nonly recording a weighted average inflation rate of 1.3%. Chart 26 shows that the more\nserious problem is that only 10% of components in the basket are recording inflation\nrates above the 2% target. So there is a “lowflation” clustering problem by index item\nand Chart 27 shows that there is also a lowflation clustering problem by country. In fact,\nthe country clustering is even more concentrated than it looks if we allow for the fact\nthat the bigger of the two upside outliers, Belgium (1.8% inflation), has experienced a\npresumably unrepeatable increase in the tax rate on electricity from 6% to 21%, as well\nas other excise duty increases.\nOne might be tempted to give the Eurozone the benefit of the doubt on inflation,\ninsofar as its output gap remains material. However, the closure of the output gap still\nrequires strong and continuing stimulus, we would argue, and even that does not\nguarantee that somehow inflation resets to target.\nOur worry about item and country lowflation clustering is not that inflation is\n“unanchored”. Our concern is that it flags a “re-anchoring” of inflation at a level well\nbelow 2% and that this new anchor will prove difficult to dislodge.\nChart 28: Output gap as % potential GDP\n4%\n3%\n2%\n1%\n0%\n-1%\n-2%\n-3%\n-4%\n-5%\n-6%\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research , AMECO\nEA UK US\nChart 29: Influence of current inflation on 5y5y EUR inflation swaps\n0.35\n0.30\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n-0.05\n-0.10\nConfidence interval +/- 2SD\n-0.15\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nNote: The chart shows the slope of the regression of 5y5y on current inflation, with rolling windows\nof 29 quarters\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n14 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nEconomists place great store in the importance of expectations and their impact on\ninflation. Chart 29 suggests an adverse feedback problem has emerged, with actual\ninflation an increasingly influential driver of 5y5y inflation (and economist long-term\nconsensus expectations).\nWith 10y20y inflation effectively at the ECB’s target, we favor short positions in 30y\nbreakevens. In the case of the OATei 2047, the “observed” breakeven drastically\nunderstates what we would consider to be a fairer measure. The issue here is that the\nlinker is almost 10 years longer than its nominal 2045 comparator in modified duration\nterms. On a duration basis, the linker lies in between the 2060 and 2066 nominal OATs\nand, of course, the 30s50s OAT curve is very steep.\nTrade: we recommended a more closely-matched breakeven trade, shorting OATei\n2047s to buy OAT 2066s to give a breakeven of 163.3bp, targeting 130bp with a\nstop-loss at 180bp on October 14. The breakeven has risen, against our\nexpectations, to 169.6bp currently and we regard this as an attractive entry level.\nWe will nudge our stop-loss level higher to 185bp.\nThe relative cheapness of the nominal 50y partly reflects the 31y maturity limit to ECB\nbuying. We regard the ECB eligibility premium for bonds within the ECB’s buying range\n(like this linker) as material, so the trade should be a beneficiary in the event of an ECB\n“taper tantrum”. An important additional feature in these turbulent times is the greater\ndispersion of the nominal’s cash flows (in PV terms). This means the trade is\nsignificantly net long convexity.\nWe see the risks to the trade being a strong Eurozone recovery causing a general\nrepricing of breakevens higher and the possibility of further heavy issuance of 50-year\nbonds across the Eurozone.\nEM linkers: feeling the contagion for higher breakevens\nThe prospect for higher yields in the US clearly affects the appetite for Emerging\nMarket (EM) assets including inflation-linked bonds. The discussion is about not only EM\nbecoming less attractive on a relative basis, but also how the higher yields in the US\naffect the dollar and thus EM currencies.\nFiscal stimulus prospects in the US should continue to drive some correction across EM\nassets, but at this point, there is still too much uncertainty on the actual reach of such\nstimulus. Investors faced strong returns in EM this year and because of the calendar\neffect, this puts pressure to square positions and reduce risk. While this correction may\nlast for a while, it is clearly creating more value in some assets. For now, the discussion\nwill be about re-sizing positions rather than valuation. Only when volatility declines and\nyields stabilize in the US will we be able to resume discussion on valuation and the level\nof yields across EM.\nLiquidity is a key issue when looking into EM linkers, in particular across EMEA, but we\nfind some interesting opportunities in Asia and LatAm.. Currency weakness ends up\nadding risks for higher inflation in some countries but FX pass-through varies a lot\ndepending on output gap. In general, we believe there is room for higher breakevens in\nEM, with key highlight for Thailand and 10y in Mexico.\nAttractive breakevens in Thailand and Mexico\nIn Asia, we believe breakevens are pricing in too much complacency on the inflation\noutlook. With prospects for higher oil prices, it makes sense to position for higher\nbreakevens in both Thailand and Korea in our view. Breakevens appear cheaper in\nThailand as inflation is already increasing, while breakevens have clearly lagged the\nmovement.\nIn EMEA, linkers are mostly illiquid and/or expensive so there is more to do in nominals\nand/or FX in our view. Yet, the currency move has triggered a widening in breakevens in\nsome countries like South Africa. We expect this movement to continue for now.\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 15\nChart 30: Breakevens to increase in some EM\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\nBrazil\nTurkey\n3.9\n3\n2.1\n1.2\nChart 31: In Brazil, high correlation between breakeven and BRL\n10% Brazil breakeven 10yr BRL - RHS 4.5\n4\n8%\n3.5\n6%\n3\n2.5\n0%\n0.3\n2/28/2014 1/24/2015 12/20/2015 11/14/2016\nSource: Bloomberg\n4%\n2\n2/28/2014 1/24/2015 12/20/2015 11/14/2016\nSource: Bloomberg\nFinally, in LatAm, we expect inflation to increase in Mexico, driving breakevens higher\nacross the curve. Although FX pass-through is very low in the country, the ongoing MXN\ndepreciation may add some pressure on inflation at the margin. In the case of Brazil, the\ncentral bank was very successful in anchoring long-term inflation expectations driving\nbreakevens lower across the bond curve. For long-only investors, we believe linkers\nshould be more resilient versus nominal bonds.\nWhile Brazil continues to have one of the highest nominal and real yields across the\nglobe, further compression requires stabilization in US yields. As long as the Brazilian\ngovernment is able to deliver on the reform front, approving a social security reform bill\nnext year, we see room for real yield compression from levels above 5.5% right now.\nBuy USD/JPY, sell CHF/SEK\nInflation may not be back yet but deflation risk is most likely gone in most regions in our\nview (the notable exception being the Eurozone, we believe, as discussed above). A year\nago we argued that the market deflation position was stretched and that there was\nroom for inflation surprises. Indeed, average inflation surprises in G10 economies have\nbeen increasing since then and are now clearly in positive territory (Chart 32). Monetary\npolicy in G10 economies is the loosest it has even been, suggesting that global inflation\ncould continue rising (Chart 33). This is not necessarily bad news, as the threat of\ndeflation is now gone. However, inflation rather than deflation trades are likely to\nbecome an important driver in G10 FX.\nWe update a heatmap of inflation risks in G10 economies to determine how to position\nfor such risks in FX. We have discussed the methodology in Inflation and FX: What if the\ndog starts barking?. The idea is to rank currencies based on a number of early warning\ninflation indicators. Using equal weights, if most indicators point towards higher\ninflation for a currency, we take this to suggest that investors should go long, against a\ncurrency for which most indicators point towards deflation, both in relative terms.\nChart 32: G10 inflation surprises (average)\nChart 33: G10 sum of spreads from Taylor rule\n40.0\n30.0\n20.0\n10.0\n0.0\n-10.0\n-20.0\n-30.0\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\n-25\n-30\nJan-00\nJan-01\nJan-02\nJan-03\nJan-04\nJan-05\nJan-06\nJan-07\nJan-08\nJan-09\nJan-10\nJan-11\nJan-12\nJan-13\nJan-14\nJan-15\nJan-16\nFeb-99\nFeb-00\nFeb-01\nFeb-02\nFeb-03\nFeb-04\nFeb-05\nFeb-06\nFeb-07\nFeb-08\nFeb-09\nFeb-10\nFeb-11\nFeb-12\nFeb-13\nFeb-14\nFeb-15\nFeb-16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.\n16 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nTable 1: Heatmap of inflation risks (green for high, red for low, in relative terms)\nTotal Inflation gap since 2007 Inflation Inflation change Core Core change Taylor spread Housing prices Output gap Change in structural fiscal Inflation surprises Credit growth Unit labour cost Unemployment gap\nNOK\nSEK\nUSD\nCAD\nGBP\nNZD\nAUD\nCHF\nEUR\nJPY\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.\nThe results in Table 1 are supportive of the USD and the scandies against JPY, EUR and\nCHF. This is fully consistent with our projections for 2017, expecting USD strength to\ncontinue, particularly against JPY, and the scandies to do well against EUR and CHF.\nBased on this analysis, we recommend buying USD/JPY and selling CHF/SEK, to position\nfor inflation risks in G10 economies. Long USD/JPY is also our top directional trade for\n2017 and we already have a trade recommendation to sell EUR/SEK. Therefore, we\nwould recommend selling CHF/SEK as a new trade to position for inflation risks.\nCHF/SEK is one of the most overvalued crosses in G10. It is currently at its highest\nvalue ever, with the exception of the level reached when the SNB removed the EUR/CHF\nfloor. We also expect the SNB to intervene to offset FX pressure, while higher\nuncertainty increases risks of a rate cut.\nThe risk to this view is if tail risk scenarios unfold in European politics, such as an early\nelection in Italy with Five Star winning, or Le Pen wining the second round in the French\nelections. Although we expect markets to be more concerned about European politics\nfollowing the US elections, we do not see tail risk scenarios in our baseline.\nTrade: We recommend selling CHF/SEK, from spot at 9.184, with a target of 8.4\nand stop loss at 9.5.\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 17\nBest Relative Value Trades\nAthanasios Vamvakidis\nMLI (UK)\nathanasios.vamvakidis@baml.com\nErjon Satko\nMLI (UK)\nerjon.satko@baml.com\nArko Sen\nMLI (UK)\narko.sen@baml.com\nShusuke Yamada, CFA >>\nMerrill Lynch (Japan)\nshusuke.yamada@baml.com\nRelative value in a macro world\n• Long EUR/JPY: data and positioning supportive; the BoJ has more tools to address\nsustainability challenges than the ECB.\n• Long RUB/KRW: US fiscal expansion suggests more upside for reflation sensitive\nRussia than interest rate sensitive Korea.\n• Sell German 2y vs OIS, buy 10y vs OIS: fade the impressive richening of shortmaturity\nGerman govies.\nLong EUR/JPY\nIn a recent report we argued that EUR/JPY could appreciate in the months ahead as the\nBoJ gains credibility and the ECB has to deal with QE constraints. Since then, the\nEUR/JPY has appreciated by 3%, but we see more upside. Although we expect the ECB\nto extend QE by a further six months in December, we see more difficulties next year.\nExtending QE will require difficult decisions, such as relaxing the capital key or buying\nbelow the depo rate. QE tapering is therefore a risk and the market could start testing\nthe ECB. Even if Draghi succeeds, the Euro could strengthen in the meantime. In\ncontrast, the BoJ’s new framework should address the sustainability challenges that\nKuroda faced this year, and allows more fiscal stimulus by keeping the government’s\nborrowing costs at zero. The ECB cannot do this, in our view. We have been short\nEUR/JPY this year, as we were expecting the ECB to extend QE, while the BoJ faced\nchallenges.\nData also suggests further EUR/JPY upside. Relative GDP growth would be consistent\nwith a stronger EUR/JPY, as the Eurozone has been gaining momentum, while growth in\nJapan remains weak (Chart 34). Relative central bank balance sheets give the same\nsignal (Chart 35). Positioning is also in support, as our analysis suggests a short EUR/JPY\nmarket position (Chart 36).\nIf the external environment improves, we think Japanese investors are likely to be JPY\nsellers again as the hedge ratio and hedge costs have both risen. One of key factors of\nthe yen’s appreciation this year might have been that, as the USD/JPY fell, institutional\ninvestors implemented additional FX-hedging to their existing forex positions as part of\ntheir risk management, which caused the USD/JPY to fall further and supply-demand to\nworsen in a vicious circle. However, this mechanism probably ran its course when the\nUSD/JPY reached 100 on the Brexit vote as we argued in $/¥’s eventual surge: Buy\nNikkei 06 September 2016. In fact, the USD/JPY has stopped falling during Tokyo\ntrading hours since the summer. Based on the decline of foreign yields and higher hedge\ncosts, hedged US Treasuries and German bunds had lost nearly all of their attraction for\nJapanese investors by the summer. US and German 10yr government bond yields sank to\nabout 0% after being hedged to the JPY, reflecting that downward pressure on yields\nhad reached the limit. Institutional investors are expected to increase their exposure to\nunhedged foreign bonds in H2 FY16.

On the other hand,\nJapanese rates are insulated from foreign movements as the BoJ directly targets the\n10yr yield. Japanese fiscal easing is also a possibility in light of reduced odds of TPP\nimplementation and a potential snap election. Any positive impact of Japanese fiscal\neasing on growth is likely to manifest in higher inflation expectations under the BoJ’s\nyield-targeting regime, which means Japanese real interest rates could actually fall.\nBased on these considerations, we recommend buying a 6M EUR/JPY 122/130 call\nspread for 1.2312% EUR (spot ref. 116.84). Risks to our trade include a severe global\nshock that could strengthen the JPY, or the return of the Eurozone crisis; for example, if\nthe government in Italy falls after Renzi loses the referendum in December or Le Pen\nwins the elections in France.\nLong RUB/KRW\nPost US elections and the improved outlook for fiscal expansion in the US, we see more\nupside in being long oil and reflation sensitive Russia than short technology and interest\nrate sensitive Korea.\nWe recommend being long RUB/KRW heading into 2017 targeting a move to 19.4\n(spot ref 18, stop 16.7). The trade is positive carry 2% per quarter.\nThe rise in US breakeven inflation is positive for risky assets broadly but could be\npainful in the short term for highly indebted countries with low interest rates. Higher US\nbreakeven inflation rates are historically associated with higher RUB/KRW (Chart 37).\nHigher US real rates are also less of a threat for Russia where local real yields are\nsignificantly higher than Korea (Table 2) and most EM peers. Korea also has relatively\nhigh private sector debt which could face pressure if BoK is forced to raise rates.\nHousehold debt has been rising at an alarming rate and domestic political turmoil facing\nthe Park administration has also added to concerns.\nIn our baseline scenarios, we expect a modest growth recovery for Korea but a stronger\ndelta for Russia where the oil price collapse over 2014-15 led to a much sharper\nslowdown earlier and activity is now in recovery stage.\nThe ToT trade shock that hit Russia in 2014 led to material underperformance in exports\nvs Korea. Over 2011-13, Russia and Korean exports were growing at about the same\nrates but since 2014 that gap widened has materially against Russia. Since early 2016,\nhowever, this has reversed with Russia catching up. In 2017, Russian exports growth\ncould outperform Korea given the outlook for oil. Moreover, it is less reliant on China or\nJapan and more reliant on Europe. CNH/KRW as well as JPY/KRW remains near multi year\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 19\nlows suggesting this will be a source of pressure on the Won given the greater trade\nlinkages (Table 2).\nOur current account forecasts for 2017 anticipate deterioration in Korea’s current\naccount surplus compared to marginal improvement in Russia’s. Recent issues at\nSamsung and Hanjin pose risks for the goods and service balances, respectively.\nElectronics account for 30% of Korea’s exports. While a stronger dollar and energy deregulation\nin the US could dampen the oil market, our energy strategists continue to\nexpect further modest gains in Brent over 2017. The RUB/KRW cross has a modest\npositive beta to oil at 25% since the beginning of 2014. Risks to the trade are mainly\nmaterial downside to oil prices vs our baseline scenario.\nSell German 2y vs OIS, buy 10y vs OIS\nIn H2 2016, we saw an impressive richening of short-maturity German govies and repo:\nwe like fading the move by selling 2y Bund vs OIS and buying the 10y vs OIS.\nGerman 2y is pricing-in structurally high demand and low supply\nThe German 2y trades at the richest against OIS since the peak in 2011 due mainly to\ndemand/supply dynamics driven by: 1) European regulation on mandatory central\nclearing and minimum initial margin requirements generating €350bn in extra collateral\nneeds in 2016-19; 2) LCR regulation and negative rates having pushed cash-rich\ncorporates into holding short-end German bonds/bills in order to store liquidity; and 3)\nnet bill issuance having been cut to negative in Q4 because falling yields created €42bn\nof excess cash for governments.\nSupply pressures are expected to ease in 2017E\nBubill auctions will resume after more than two months of absence while more\ntreasuries may be the answer to an excessive rise in yields by increasing net issuance in\nthe front-end. The ECB may also be concerned by the richness of front-end German\ngovies (see Couré’s speech on 3 November). If the Eurozone fails to create enough\nsafe/low-volatility securities for the market to work efficiently, then the central bank\ncould compensate by lending more collateral, by adjusting counterparty frameworks and\nrunning higher balance sheets or even by issuing bills to satisfy safe asset demand in\nthe non-bank system.\nECB QE and potential periphery stress supports 10y outperformance\nGiven the tail risks in 2017 and our call of ECB QE extension to September 2017, we\nprefer to add a 10y DBR long vs OIS – we expect 10s to outperform in such a scenario.\nIn Chart 38 we show that ECB tapering expectations have now pushed 2s10s vs OIS to\nlevels before the announcement of ECB QE on 22 January 2015. However, we see even\nmore reasons for the ECB to extend the €80bn per month in QE to September 2017.\nChart 37: Return to a different time\n45\n3.5\n40\n3.0\n35\n30\n2.5\n25\n2.0\n20\n1.5\n15\n10\n1.0\n5\n0.5\n0\n0.0\nJan-10 Oct-11 Jul-13 Apr-15 Jan-17\nRUB/KRW (LHS)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nUS 5y5y breakeven (RHS)\nTable 2: Russia vs S.

According to our rates & FX sentiment survey, clients\nare relatively short in relation to their average positioning across major fixed income\nmarkets including the EU, UK, and to a lesser extent the US (Chart 42). Such position\nindications suggest that contrarian investors should be long duration in Europe, the UK,\nand the US. These positions have been factored into some of our pre-existing\nfundamental views, which include receiving euro vs US rates and expecting UK\nsupply/demand dynamics to be supportive of longer-dated Gilts going into year end. We\nare reluctant to recommend outright long duration positions in US rates at present\ngiven that the sharp election-induced selloff could extend over the coming weeks.\nConsensus expects rising inflation\nInstead, we focus on contrarian views regarding the outlook for inflation, which\nunderpinned some of short rates positioning and is expected to increase with US fiscal\npolicy expansion and base effects. According to our recent Global Fund Manager Survey\ntaken prior to the election, global inflation expectations are on the rise, with 70% of\nsurvey respondents expecting higher global CPI readings in the near term. Headline CPI\nhas been moving higher in the US, and Chinese PPI recently turned positive for the first\ntime since 2012. Similarly, global market-based measures of inflation expectations have\nbeen rising, with 5y5y forward inflation swaps in the US, UK, and Europe all rising over\nrecent months and US inflation protected funds receiving nearly $2 billion in inflows\nsince the start of October.\nDisinflation may strike back\nRisks to the near-term outlook for inflation could rise if: (1) expectations for US fiscal\nstimulus disappoint as House deficit hawks insist on revenue-neutral tax cuts or\nspending measures; (2) Beijing pushes the RMB lower before President-elect Trump\ntakes office leading to risk-off and imported disinflation; (3) commodity prices decline if\nan OPEC deal cannot be reached, the USD meaningfully appreciates, or if EM growth\nfalters; or (4) EU slowdown fears rise should the ECB taper due to technical constraints.\nWe recommend buying 3-year 0% inflation floors in the US, which currently\ndemand only 9 basis of premium. These levels are low in relation to recent history and\ncould increase if Beijing were to more rapidly weaken the RMB or if commodities falter\n(Chart 43). Investors seeking to offset the premium could consider selling longer-dated\nmore deeply negative floors under the assumption that any near-term disinflation scare\nwould be short-lived and likely be offset by more activist monetary policies thereafter.\nThe risk to the trade is a spike in commodity prices or a continued rise in core inflation.\nChart 42: Z-score of duration positioning: short except in Japan/Canada\n0.5\nChart 43: Cost of 3Y 0% deflation floor has spiked with weak RMB (bps)\n60\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n-1.5\n20\n-2.0\n10\n-2.5\nEU Core UK EU Periph US JP CA 0\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nNote: negative z-score values indicate short positioning, positive z-score values indicate long\npositions; z-score taken from survey net exposure index with responses dating back to 1992 for US,\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nCA, JP, UK & EU, EU periphery data available back to 2013.

Despite GBP appreciating following the High Court\ndecision for a Parliamentary vote to activate Article 50 and the US elections, the\nmarket’s short GBP position remains stretched according to our positioning analysis\n(Chart 44). Our Global Fund Manager Survey flags short GBP as the strongest consensus\nview in G10 FX. Our FX & Rates Sentiment survey also suggests that the majority of\ninvestors look for some type of hard Brexit. Although we have been arguing for upside\nGBP risks after the recent flash crash, our baseline projections expect GBP/USD to hit a\nnew low of 1.15 in Q1 after the UK activates Article 50.\nHowever, we have argued that GBP tail risks are skewed to the upside. UK data have\nbeen strong post-referendum and could continue surprising to the upside. There is room\nfor positive headlines at the political front, if the UK agrees on the transitional period\nthat could extend the current regime until a final trader deal with the EU. A\nParliamentary vote on Article 50 activation could reduce the chances of a hard Brexit.\nAnd Trump’s victory could lead to an early bilateral US-UK trade deal, while it increases\nthe geopolitical importance of the UK for the rest of the EU. Moreover, we expect\nmarkets to become more concerned about political tail risks in the rest of Europe\nfollowing Trump’s victory in the US elections. Political risks in Italy and France could\nquestion the sustainability of the Eurozone, thus weakening EUR/GBP.\nIf Prime Minister Matteo Renzi loses the referendum on the constitutional reform in\nDecember, Italy could have a snap election, which the Five Star party could win based on\nthe latest polls. Even if Italy avoids elections in 2017, the next election will take place by\nMay 2018, and markets could become concerned about it earlier if Renzi loses the\nreferendum. The 2017 French election is another concern. President of the far-right\nparty and presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is ahead in the polls to win the first\nround. Winning the second round is much more difficult, as she will need more than 50%\nof the votes, but investors could start to expect the unexpected after being blindsided in\nthe UK and the US. Other considerations also support selling EUR/GBP. Data are\nconsistent with a weaker EUR/GBP (Chart 44). The market is short both EUR and GBP,\nbut long EUR/GBP, with the latest flows pointing to more EUR downside and GBP\nupside.\nUsing a spot reference of 0.8672, we recommend selling EUR/GBP via a 6M\n0.84/0.80 put spread, to capture both the referendum in Italy and the French\nelections, but also give time for GBP to recover in case it weakens further\nfollowing activation of Article 50 in Q1.

Not surprisingly, these\ntwo basket trades also form a part of our trade recommendations. In fact, these shorts\nmight have increased after US election outcome due to fears of protectionism.\nAs a result, we believe that contrarian investors should be long KRW, CNY and SGD\nagainst USD or JPY. Amongst these, our favourite contrarian trade is long KRW vs JPY.\nThree triggers\nThree reasons why the current developments may ironically be positive for Korean Won:\n• After a brief period of outflows from the equity markets, we believe inflows are set\nto resume. A sustained rally in S&P Index due to the anticipated de-regulation and\nfiscal push will undoubtedly be positive for KOSPI (given the high positive\ncorrelation) and as a result for KRW. Moreover, history suggests that the current sell\noff in rates and KRW is unlikely to spur considerable outflows from the debt market.\n• It is still not very clear if the outcome of this US election is going to be negative for\nforeign trade. Should these concerns decrease, positive impact from looser US\nfiscal policy could push Asia growth higher.\n• The recent sell off in KRW vs USD from 1100 to 1150 is indicative that domestic\nconcerns around politics, Hanjin shipping troubles and Samsung related issues\nseems to have been largely priced in. As a result, we believe that any additional\ndomestic negative news is unlikely to adversely impact KRW materially.\nAdditionally, in terms of valuation, our long term COMPASS model indicates that the\nKorean Won is one of the most undervalued currencies in Asia.\nJPY better than USD as funder\nWe believe it makes sense to express this contrarian view by short JPY instead of USD.\nCurrently JPY/KRW is at 10.9 and our forecasts indicate it to be at 10.6 by Q4 2017. In\nthe case of a stronger USD, we expect BOK to sound cautious with the pace of KRW\ndepreciation and smooth the move higher in USD/KRW. Moreover, USD/JPY has greater\nsensitivity to USD rates than KRW.\nChart 46: KRW, KOSPI, SPX highly correlated\n1.5 3m correl SPX and KOSPI\n3m correl KOSPI and KRW/USD\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\nChart 47: KRW more influenced by equity flows than bond flows\n8000 Bond flows Equity flows\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0\n-2000\n-4000\n-6000\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 25\nLatAm: short BRL/MXN\nOur top contrarian trade in Latin American markets is selling BRL/MXN (spot 6.00,\ntarget 5.00, stop 6.75). The trade benefits from valuation, positioning and our views of\nthe expected effects of the US election on the Brazilian and Mexican economies.\nMXN 10% undervalued, BRL 5% overvalued\nWe estimate the Mexican peso is about 10% undervalued while the Brazilian real is\nabout 5% overvalued, based on our Compass valuation model. The model provides\nestimates of long-run equilibrium trade-weighted exchange rates consistent with the\nconvergence of current account balances toward levels that are in line with country\nfundamentals that determine savings and investments.\nMexico’s real exchange rate index is at its lowest since at least 1999, and about 35%\ncheaper than its long-run average. Brazil’s real exchange rate has risen sharply in 2016\nand is now around 8% stronger than its long-run average (Chart 48).\nLatAm under Trump’s world\nWe believe the election of Donald Trump as the next president of the US will be\nnegative to Latin American economies. His economic plan will likely involve a significant\nfiscal expansion, perhaps tighter monetary policy and some protectionist’s measures.\nThese will likely lead to higher US rates and a strengthening of the US dollar. Higher\ninternational interest rates are a negative shock for emerging economies and any\nacceleration in US economic growth will be skewed to domestic nontraded goods.\nWe think Brazil’s economy will likely be more negatively affected since its strategy to\ngradually reduce budget deficits is based on low global rates, capital inflows and higher\ndomestic growth.\nMexico, on the other hand, may benefit on relative terms from a construction and\ninfrastructure boom in the US. Any revival in US manufacturing would also be good for\nMexico, particularly if Trump’s protectionist measures are not as substantial as feared.\nMarket is not positioned for a MXN rally and BRL selloff\nSelling BRL/MXN is a contrarian trade. Foreign investors are significantly long BRL\naccording to our positioning index based on BM&F data. Market positioning by local\ninvestors is even more stretched toward long BRL. On the contrary, speculative\ninvestors are short MXN according our positioning index based on CFTC data (Chart 49).\nSo positioning unwinding would actually help our short BRL/MXN strategy.\nChart 48: Real exchange rate is cheap in Mexico, expensive in Brazil\nChart 49: Market is positioned long BRL and short MXN\n150\n130\n110\n90\n70\n50\nLong-run average = 100\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n150\n130\n110\n90\n70\n50\n3\nLong BRL and MXN positionining\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n-2\n2013 2014 2015 2016\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n-2\nBrazil real exchange rate\nMexico real exchange rate\nLong BRL position\nLong MXN position\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n26 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nEEMEA: long Turkey credit\nTurkey has been one of the big underperformers among the major EM lately, and now\nvaluations are the most attractive in a long time. Sovereign credit spreads are down to\nBB- levels even though the country is still rated as a BB+ credit (Chart 50). The lira\nwhich our Compass model has shown as overvalued for many years is now finally in line\nwith the equilibrium of about 3.30 vs USD. The REER is almost down to the lows\nreached during the 2013 taper tantrum and 2015 China devaluation. In equities the\ndiscount vs GEM is at historical highs (Chart 51). So contrarians should get interested.\nTo be clear, we have been warning for a long time that the leverage and stimulus driven\ngrowth model was weakening and needed a boost through supply side reforms. And\nobviously political events have been manifold. But as we are talking about year-ahead\ntrades rather than the near-term ideas, we believe it is worth noting that Turkish\nmarkets have a habit of alternating between bad and good years: 2010, ‘12, ‘14 good;\n2011, ’13 and ’15 bad. After another bad year in 2016, one could consider a possible\nrebound in 2017.\nNot a short-term trade\nThis is not a 1-month but rather a 3-6 months trade, where Q1 will likely be critical. In\nthe short term, US rates volatility is harmful for countries like Turkey that have funded\nlarge current account deficits with short-term debt. This interacts with the local\nsentiment weakness that has lately resulted in rising deposit dollarization. An\nacceleration of this trend would now be the biggest risk to asset prices, in our view.\nBefore entering the trade we should see dollarization stabilize. Lately households have\nbeen net buyers of dollars for the first time since the coup attempt. We should see a\ncouple of weeks of dollar selling to confirm that this potential risk is dissipating.\nThe trigger for a rebound from low valuations likely lies in a stabilization of sentiment\nwhich could occur during the first half of next year. Currently the state of emergency is\nscheduled to end in January, and the news flow suggests a referendum by April/May. In a\npositive scenario, politics calm down by the referendum which may also reduce the need\nfor further stimulus through fiscal, monetary policy or moral suasion of the banks.\nAmong asset classes, we think Eurobonds provide the best risk/reward as the rating is a\nnatural valuation “magnet”, and the credit remains a solid BB+ fundamentally, in our\nview. Our preferred bonds would be the 26s (current: 5% for October 26s) on the 10y\ntenor and 45s (current 6.5%) on the long end. However, a rebound would also favor\nequities and local spreads. FX is least compelling as TRY has been asymmetric in recent\nyears: big sell-offs and small recoveries. We think the reason is high inflation and a\npolicy bias for a weaker exchange rate. In FX a positive view would be best expressed by\nselling the USD/TRY risk-reversal which is currently at around 5.0 and could target 4.0 in\na scenario where the sovereign rallies back to BB+.\nChart 50: Turkey sovereign priced too cheaply at implied BB- rating\nChart 51: Real effective TRY and Turkey equities near the 5-year lows\nBBB\nBBB-\nBB+\nBB\nImplied rating for 10y Turkey\nActual rating - Turkey\n55\n50\n45\n40\nReal Effective Exchange Rate for TRY\nTurkey-GEM P/E gap, rhs\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\nBB-\nMar-2015\nApr-2015\nMay-2015\nJun-2015\nAug-2015\nSep-2015\nOct-2015\nNov-2015\nDec-2015\nJan-2016\nFeb-2016\nMar-2016\nMay-2016\nJun-2016\nJul-2016\nAug-2016\nSep-2016\nOct-2016\nNov-2016\n35\nJan-11\nNov-11\nSep-12\nJul-13\nMay-14\nMar-15\nJan-16\nNov-16\n-8\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg,\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Haver, EPFR\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 27\nBest Vol Trades\nRalf Preusser, CFA\nMLI (UK)\nralf.preusser@baml.com\nHerve Belmas\nMLPF&S\nherve.belmas@baml.com\nSphia Salim\nMLI (UK)\nsphia.salim@baml.com\nChristopher Xiao\nMLPF&S\nchristopher.xiao@baml.com\nTension in Trump’s policies are bullish for vol\n• Weighing up the impact of fiscal easing vs protectionism and shifting from\ndeflation to inflation risks should be bullish for vol.\n• In rates, we see room for the belly of the curve to reprice to the dots. 2y1y should\ncheapen 75bp, vol is cheap vs rates and the skew the least expensive in that sector.\n• In FX, we think vol and skew have room to reprice higher compared to the repricing\nseen in rates. We like cheapening a EURUSD put with a 3m30y strangle.\n• In EM, USDCNH calls are attractive in our view. A stronger USD adds pressure to\ndepreciate, while the risks of trade tariffs, labelling China a currency manipulator,\netc could lead to a sharp re-pricing or risk premia higher.\nHighest conviction in FX, belly of the US curve and CNH\nWe view Donald Trump’s election as bullish for USD, bearish for real rates and\nchallenging for EM. The inherent tensions in President-elect Trump’s policy proposals,\nas well as the question marks over the Fed’s reaction function should also support a\nrepricing of vol higher, especially since neither FX, nor front-end rates volatility look\nstretched by historical standards.\nHowever, expressing a view on long-end nominal rates is harder, and implications for\nrates vol are less clear. USD 5y5y breakevens are consistent with the Fed’s definition of\nprice stability for the first time in more than a year. In Europe, the sell-off in rates (both\nBunds and BTPS) is tightening monetary conditions at a time when the ECB should do\nmore, not less. Finally, the BoJ’s yield curve control should provide an anchor for JGBs.\nConsequently we focus on the following three trades:\n11. Buying US$100mn 2y1y payer, struck at 2.50% (ATM+69bp)\n12. Buying a EURUSD 3m 1.05 put, partly financed with a 150bp-wide 3m30y strangle\n13. We recommend buying a 6m USDCNH 7.60 call\nUS rates to converge to the dots: attractive in vol\nThe view on long-end rates is complicated by the significant repricing of breakevens,\nthe likelihood of the ECB doing more, and the BoJ defending its JGB yield target. We do,\nhowever, see room for a further increase in risk premia in the belly of the US curve. We\nbelieve that the market will ultimately view the Fed dots as a floor, rather than a cap.\nSupply pressures will weigh on the belly of the curve, rather than the long-end. This\nmakes the cheapness of the upper left corner of the vol surface attractive.\nAs we look for a repricing of Fed expectations, to levels more consistent with the dot\nplot, we recommend buying US$100mn 2y1y payer, struck at 2.50% (25-delta), i.e.,\nATM +69bp. The cost is US$165K, equivalent to 17bp of yield. We target a PNL of\nUS$300K.\n28 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nWe estimate that it is in 3y1y, 2y2y and 2y1y that the selloff would be largest (75-85bp\n– see Table 5) were the OIS curve to align with the median dots up to end of 2019.\nOptions are attractive to position for a selloff in those forwards for two main reasons:\n1. Volatilities in 1y and 2y tails appear to trade cheap on our macro model. More\nspecifically, accounting for the relationship between implied vols and the first\nthree principal components of the swap curve, we find that 2y1y implied vol\nshould be trading 22bp normal higher (Chart 52), and 2y2y vol should be 19bp\nhigher. A simpler historical regression of 2y1y vol vs the 2y1y forward rate also\nsuggests normal vol should be around 21bp higher (Chart 53).\n2. Payer skews could richen in 2y1y and 2y2y. While they are looking rich across\n6M+ expiries in 1y and 2y tails (based on payer-ladder breakevens/ATM vol), we\nnote that this has been the case for some time now and it’s rather in gamma on\n5y+ tails that skews now appear richest on a 6m z-score basis. Relative to what\nhas been realized in the past month, the payer skew appears just fair in 2y1y,\nwhile it is rich across tails in longer expiries.\nChart 52: Market vs fitted level of 2y1y vol, based on macro model (*)\n120\n100\n80\n60\nChart 53: 2y1y implied vol is 21bp too low on a regression vs 2y1y fwd\n140\n120\n100\n80\n40\n20\n0\n2y1y market implied vol\n2y1y fitted\nSep-11\nDec-11\nMar-12\nJun-12\nSep-12\nDec-12\nMar-13\nJun-13\nSep-13\nDec-13\nMar-14\nJun-14\nSep-14\nDec-14\nMar-15\nJun-15\nSep-15\nDec-15\nMar-16\nJun-16\nSep-16\n60\n40\ny = 35.017x + 28.016\nR² = 0.8667\n20\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\npast 6y since July last Linear (past 6y)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.

Table 3 below\nconfirms that the 2y1y point is attractive relative to other forwards (2 nd best), with a net\npayout ratio of 1.9 (2.9:1 gross) after three months. The best payer on that metric is the\n3m5y 25-delta OTM payer (strike of 2.05%), which we recommend as an alternative for\nthose confident that the repricing of the OIS curve to the dots will take place by Feb-17.\nTable 3: Payoff ratios when buying a 25-delta OTM payer, under the selloff scenario where forwards converge to the levels implied by the median Fed dots(*)\nTrade 3m1y 3m2y 3m5y 3m10y 6m1y 6m2y 6m5y 6m10y 1y1y 1y2y 1y5y 1y10y 2y1y 2y2y 2y5y 2y10y 3y1y 3y2y 3y5y 3y10y\nStrike (25-delta), % 1.31 1.54 2.05 2.44 1.49 1.73 2.23 2.60 1.84 2.08 2.51 2.84 2.50 2.65 2.95 3.21 2.98 3.08 3.28 3.47\nATM forw ard, % 1.14 1.34 1.77 2.13 1.24 1.43 1.83 2.17 1.44 1.62 1.96 2.25 1.81 1.92 2.17 2.38 2.04 2.12 2.32 2.47\nPremium, bp of yield 4.1 4.9 6.9 7.4 6.5 7.5 9.6 10.0 10.4 11.5 13.4 14.1 17.0 18.5 19.2 19.6 23.8 24.2 23.8 23.8\n3m roll, bp of yield -4.1 -4.9 -6.9 -7.4 -5.1 -5.4 -5.9 -5.4 -5.0 -5.0 -4.3 -4.2 -4.4 -4.3 -3.3 -2.8 -3.5 -3.2 -2.6 -2.2\n3m selloff to the dots 11 31 59 48 18 30 54 45 35 58 65 45 75 80 65 45 85 74 57 45\nReturn, bp of yield -4.1 -4.4 16.5 5.4 -0.6 3.8 16.0 10.7 9.3 21.3 24.8 13.2 32.6 35.1 26.4 16.3 39.6 33.5 24.2 18.3\nNet payout ratio -1.00 -0.89 2.41 0.73 -0.10 0.51 1.66 1.08 0.90 1.85 1.85 0.94 1.91 1.90 1.37 0.83 1.66 1.39 1.01 0.77\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.

In particular, we recommend\nbuying a EURUSD 3m 1.05 put for US$100 pips (off 1.0730 spot), partially\nfinanced with the sale of US$100mn 150bp-wide 3m30y strangle (sold at\nUS$600k).\nWhile potential fiscal stimulus has already been priced into rates term premia and rates\nvolatility to some extent, it is not sufficiently priced into the FX market, in our view:\n• Rates skew in gamma on long-tails has moved decisively for payers, while EURUSD\nskew is just beginning to price in higher US rates (Chart 59). This suggests to us\nthat the market may already be partially protected against higher rates in the longend,\nsuch that a further selloff may not see as strong a rally in gamma on long-tails.\n• On the other hand, a further rally in the USD may catch investors under positioned\nand result in greater volatility in the currency markets.\n• A principal component analysis of rates (US, EUR and JPY) and FX vols highlight that\nUS rates vols and USDJPY vol are expensive, while 3m10y vol in EUR and JPY are\ncheap, along with EURUSD vol (Chart 60). While the cheapness of 3m10y vol in EUR\nand JPY can be explained by expectations of QE expansion in the two regions, we\nthink that there is value in owning EURUSD vol.\nFrom a terminal rates perspective, we are comfortable selling a 150bp-wide strangle for\nthe following reasons:\n• We believe the result of the elections are a game-changer for the outlook on the US\neconomy. As such we have probably entered a new regime for US rates whereby we\nare unlikely to retest the historical lows in 30y rates recorded in Aug-16 (1.67%).\nThis suggests little downside in selling an ATM-75bp receiver (1.66% strike).\n• In a scenario where US rates sell-off, USD is also likely to strengthen. The positive\ncorrelation between US yields and the USD has returned due to expectations for\nfiscal stimulus boosting economic growth. Furthermore, we would also argue that a\nsubstantial selloff in US rates, accompanied with USD strength may be selfdefeating\nas it would put pressure on emerging markets and risky assets, thereby\nresulting in a flight to quality bid for USTs. The risk is that of large foreign reserve\nselling by EM central banks, putting upward pressure on US rates and downward\npressure on the USD.\nChart 54: FX vol just beginning to price impact of higher rates\nChart 55: Residual of FX and rates volatilities based on a 1y PCA (*)\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (*) payerReceiver = 3m30y 50bp OTM payer vol-50bp\nOTM receiver vol.

A stronger USD by itself\nadds pressure to depreciate as China still needs looser financial conditions to maintain\nstability in the debt market, a relationship confirmed by the USDCNY rally following the\n2015 Fed hike. With Trump’s victory, we see increased risk of a larger depreciation.\nTrump publicly labeled China as a currency manipulator on multiple occasions during the\ncampaign, so any speculation of anti-trade policies could put significant depreciation\npressure on the Renminbi. Potential trade tariffs on Chinese exports to the US could\nraise the probability of a trade war. Furthermore, Trump could encourage the Treasury\nto alter its criteria for labelling currency manipulators, which could also hurt trade\nrelationships. Either scenario would lead to a sharp re-pricing of risk premia higher.\nThe Trade: Buy USDCNH 6m 7.60 call\nWe recommend buying a 6m USDCNH 7.60 call for 0.37% USD (off 6.9700\nforward), with a target of 1% USD. USDCNH topside is now at the cheapest levels\nsince the August 2015 depreciation (Chart 56). The trade could benefit from either a\nrally in spot as well as any increase in the risk premium between now and inauguration\non speculation of anti-trade policies. The structure appreciates significantly from\nincreases in volatility, which is plausible given the 300% increase in volatility in August\n2015 and the 100% increase from October 2015 to February 2016. The risk to the trade\nis that China increases capital controls and dampens USDCNH appreciation, which could\ncause the options to expire worthless.\nChart 56: USDCNH topside the cheapest since pre-depreciation\n20\n16\n12\n8\n4\n0\n+300\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n+100\n%\nUSDCNH 6m 10d call vol\nTable 4: Hypothetical trade performance on Inauguration Day (Jan 20th)\nSpot\nVols\nunchanged\nVols 20%\nhigher\nVols 50%\nhigher\nVols 100%\nhigher\n6.8 -81% -49% 24% 197%\n6.9 -68% -30% 41% 235%\n7 -51% -5% 100% 278%\n7.1 -32% 49% 132% 305%\n7.2 0% 103% 170% 378%\n7.3 49% 122% 232% 441%\n7.4 124% 200% 305% 522%\n7.5 224% 319% 441% 630%\n7.6 386% 470% 565% 741%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 31\nStress testing CNY\nClaudio Piron\nMerrill Lynch (Singapore)\nclaudio.piron@baml.com\nYang Chen\nMerrill Lynch (Hong Kong)\nychen8@baml.com\nGabriele Foa\nMLI (UK)\ngabriele.foa@baml.com\nRonald Man\nMerrill Lynch (Hong Kong)\nronald.man@baml.com\nStress testing CNY\n• We stress test China’s FX reserves to capital outflows and warn of a potential\nUSD520bn fall in FX reserves in 2017, translating into higher CNY volatility.\n• We also look at broader EM FX sensitivity to CNY depreciation and find ZAR and\nRUB most vulnerable.\n• We examine if bond index and MSCI inclusion could significantly offset outflows,\nbut are doubtful for now.\nCNY – anything left in reserve?\nWe forecast USD/CNY to rise to 7.25 by year-end 2017 based on sustained capital\noutflows from China and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) allowing the exchange rate\nto depreciate accordingly. A key change in the PBoC’s new FX regime, announced in\nAugust 2015, is to raise the influence of market forces over the exchange rate.\nWe showed that not all outflows are created equal. Some outflows are good and reflect\nstructural changes in China’s economy and liberalization of China’s financial account;\nsome outflows are ugly in the sense they represent illicit outflows. Yet both types of\noutflows are influenced by policy uncertainty in China, which we showed can explain a\nsignificant amount of capital outflows through Chinese purchases of overseas assets.\nThe impact of capital outflows alone on China’s FX reserves is negative. A decline in FX\nreserves is also associated with an increase in volatility of the RMB (Chart 57). But the\nnegative impact on FX reserves may be offset by China’s trade balance. If China’s trade\nbalance and capital outflows are similar to that recorded in 2015 and 2016, then China’s\nFX reserves would be between USD 2,600bn and USD 2,900bn in 2017. This represents\na fall of USD520-220bn given current FX reserves of USD3,120bn and would amount to\nChina having diminished control over its currency and higher CNY volatility – assuming\nno dramatic changes to capital controls.\nChart 57: China FX reserves (down) and RMB volatility (up)\n4,000\n3,750\n3,500\n3,250\n3,000\n2,750\n1,500\n1,250\n1,000\n750\n500\n250\n2,500\n0\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nChina FX reserves, USDbn USD/CNY 1Y rolling standard deviation, pips (RHS)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n32 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nTable 5: Scenario analysis of China’s 2017 FX reserves (yellow denotes lower reserves/ blue higher)\nTrade balance, USDbn\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500\n300 2,885 2,935 2,985 3,035 3,085 3,135 3,185 3,235 3,285\n350 2,835 2,885 2,935 2,985 3,035 3,085 3,135 3,185 3,235\n400 2,785 2,835 2,885 2,935 2,985 3,035 3,085 3,135 3,185\n450 2,735 2,785 2,835 2,885 2,935 2,985 3,035 3,085 3,135\n500 2,685 2,735 2,785 2,835 2,885 2,935 2,985 3,035 3,085\n550 2,635 2,685 2,735 2,785 2,835 2,885 2,935 2,985 3,035\n600 2,585 2,635 2,685 2,735 2,785 2,835 2,885 2,935 2,985\n650 2,535 2,585 2,635 2,685 2,735 2,785 2,835 2,885 2,935\n700 2,485 2,535 2,585 2,635 2016 2,685 rate 2,735 2,785 2,835 2,885\n750\n800\n2,435\n2,385\n2,485\n2,435\n2,535\n2,485\n2,585\n2,535\n2,635\n2,585\n2,685\n2,635\n2,735\n2,685\n2,785\n2015 rate\n2,735\n2,835\n2,785\n850 2,335 2,385 2,435 2,485 2,535 2,585 2,635 2,685 2,735\n900 2,285 2,335 2,385 2,435 2,485 2,535 2,585 2,635 2,685\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg. 2016 rate is annualized from the first 3 quarters of data.\nCapital outflow, USDbn\nTable 5, above, shows a scenario analysis of China’s FX reserves in 2017 under different\ntrade balance and capital outflows. The analysis makes two assumptions. The first\nassumption is all the changes in the Balance of Payment’s (BoP) reserve assets are\nreflected in the headline FX reserves figure. The second assumption is that the income\nbalance is USD -36bn, which was derived from the annual rate since 2015.\nWe believe a decline of FX reserves to USD 2,600bn to USD 2,900bn would only be a\nproblem for China if it attempted to implement a “fixed exchange rate” without capital\ncontrols. Such an FX regime requires heavy FX intervention and would put downward\npressure on its FX reserves, making this FX regime choice no longer tenable for China.\nThe IMF’s framework for calculating adequate FX reserves is based on whether there\nare capital controls and whether the currency operates on a fixed or floating exchange\nrate regime (Table 6). The latest readings show a fixed exchange rate regime without\ncapital controls in China would require USD 2,911bn of FX reserves, which probably\nwon’t be achieved, as shown in Table 1. Meanwhile, a floating exchange rate regime\nwith no capital controls would require USD 1,618bn of FX reserves. Fewer FX reserves\nwould be needed to manage a floating currency that would adjust freely to capital flows.\nThis reinforces the view that the CNY is moving toward a more flexible FX regime as its\nFX reserves are depleted (barring a draconian step capital control measures).\nSkeptics may counter that China could always ratchet up capital controls to reassert\ncontrol over its currency. However, the efficacy of this is questionable. The experience\nof 2016 shows that in spite of more capital controls introduced in late 2015 (e.g.,\nonshore window guidance restricting the sale of FX by onshore banks) capital outflows\nhave continued along with FX reserve depletion, albeit at a slower pace. Ultimately, this\nmeans China’s ability to exert control over the CNY is being eroded, while the risk of\nmore CNY volatility is rising. This is our scenario for 2017, with the tail risk that “ugly\nflows” or illicit capital flight due to domestic financial stability concerns could drive\nsharper CNY depreciation and FX reserve depletion. It is under this tail risk scenario that\nthe temptation for draconian capital controls becomes a danger. For this reason, we\nbelieve it will be important to monitor the nature of the capital outflow and not just the\nsize of the outflow. Good outflow such as Overseas Direct Investment by state-owned\nTable 6: China reserves adequacy recommendations based on IMF guidelines\nLatest,\nUSDbn\nCapital control\nNo capital control\nFixed Floating Fixed Floating\nWeight, % USDbn Weight, % USDbn Weight, % USDbn Weight, % USDbn\nShort-term debt 767 30 230 30 230 30 230 30 230\nOther liabilities 961 20 192 20 192 20 192 15 144\nExports 2,156 10 216 10 216 10 216 5 108\nBroad money 22,728 5 1,136 2.5 568 10 2,273 5 1,136\nRecommended reserves 1,774 1,206 2,911 1,618\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, SAFE\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 33\nfirms can be naturally slowed by internal directives. Bad outflow such falling CNY\ndeposits among foreign subsidiaries of China banks can also be managed. However, it is\nthe inherent speculative and unstable nature of domestic capital flight that we\ncharacterize as ugly flows that poses the greatest risk to the central bank.\nRegressions and scenario implications for EM FX\nWe used a simple regression to quantify the impact of the RMB depreciation on key EM\nFX: BRL, RUB, INR, TRY, and ZAR 1 . We analyzed two cases: 1) Base case – USD/CNY rises\nto 7.25 and market volatility, which we use the VIX as a proxy, is unchanged from its\ncurrent level; 2) Risk case – USD/CNY rises to 8.00 and intense RMB depreciation\nexpectations cause market volatility to rise by three standard deviations. We find:\n• The most vulnerable currencies to RMB depreciation are ZAR, RUB and TRY (Chart\n58). The impact of RMB depreciation on BRL and INR is small. This is probably due\nto stronger idiosyncratic factors for BRL and INR in recent years.\n• An increase in market volatility associated with USD/CNY rising to 8.00 would raise\nthe depreciation of EM FX by 1ppt (BRL)-11ppt(ZAR) relative to our 7.25 baseline.\n• In our base case of USD/CNY rising to 7.25 by end-2017, the market is overpricing\ndepreciation pressures from the RMB on EM currencies. This partly reflects other\nfactors have more sway over market expectations at the time of writing, such as\nimplications of the US elections outcome.\n• In our risk case of USD/CNY rising to 8.00 and high volatility, there is room for\nadditional depreciation in the ZAR and RUB (Chart 58).\nChart 58: EM FX sensitivity to RMB and market volatility\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\nZAR RUB TRY BRL INR\nForecast change vs SDR, % (Volatile markets and USD/CNY at 8.00)\nForecast change vs SDR, % (Same volatility and USD/CNY at 7.25)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nChart 59: Scenario analysis of EM FX against market pricing\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\nZAR RUB TRY BRL INR\nForecast change vs SDR, % (Volatile markets and USD/CNY at 8.00)\nForecast change vs SDR, % (Same volatility and USD/CNY at 7.25)\nForward implied change by end-2017, %\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nCan bond and equity inflows save the day? Not in the near term\nGiven the problematic issue of capital outflows and limited efficacy of moderate capital\nflows, another solution could be to attract more foreign portfolio inflows into China’s\nsizable bond and equity markets. More favorable investment policies geared to overseas\ninvestors investing in China’s interbank bond market reveal a clear policy intention to\nopen up China’s financial market. As a result, expectations are rising for China to be\nincluded in global bond indices. However, the following key obstacles for index inclusion\nremain, although reasons vary depending on the index: 1) lack of full accessibility:\ncurrently qualified investors only include medium and long-term investors while hedge\nfunds are excluded; 2) insufficient clarification on requirements of fund remittance; 3)\nlack of clarification on tax issues; 4) lack of accessibility to onshore FX/rates hedging\ntools. Back from our 2016 China Conference, we believe allowing foreign private\ninvestors to access onshore repo, onshore FX swap and forwards would be the next\nsteps to follow.\n1 Our dependent variable is the weekly changes of SDR/EM; our independent variables are the weekly changes in the\nSDR/EUR, SDR/CNY, SDR/USD and the VIX index, and a constant. Natural logarithms were taken for all variables and our\nsample period is Jan’14-Nov’16, when the start of the RMB depreciation trend. We base our currencies against the SDR\nto define their value (See Assessing China’s Exchange Rate Regime, Frankel and Wei (2007) for a detailed explanation.).\nTo compute the forecast change in each currency, we use our global FX forecasts to obtain our independent variables.\n34 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nThe most influential global bond index is believed to be the Citibank World Government\nBond Index (Citi WGBI), which is used as the benchmark for more than $2tn of AUM. The\nmost influential EM bond index is the JPM Government Bond Index – Emerging markets\nGlobal/Diversified (JPM GBI-EM Global/Diversified), which is used as the benchmark for\nabout $200bn AUM and caps each country’s share to 10%. A caveat, however, is that\nthe actual size of indexed money or ETFs should be smaller. The most crucial country\ncriteria of Citi WGBI is “fully accessible to foreign investors,” which makes China less\nlikely to be included by far given its accessibility to only medium- and long-term\ninvestors. Even if China is being considered, the assessment usually takes a long time.\nSo we believe the case for China to be included into Citi WGBI in 2017 is unlikely.\nBy contrast, JPM GBI-EM Global/Diversified only requires accessibility to the majority of\nforeign investors and does not factor in tax hurdles in eligibility. We believe China has\nbetter chance to be included into the JPM GBI-EM Global/Diversified index. While the\nexact timing is hard to predict, an optimistic scenario possibly leaves 2H17 on the table.\nUsually when a big country is being included, bonds are introduced slowly over many\nmonths to enable clients to rotate without too much disruption.\nWe would expect China’s inclusion to account for 10% of the JPM GBI-EM Global\nDiversified index. Turkey, Malaysia, S. Africa, and Thailand would lose the largest shares\nin the index, while the shares of Brazil, Mexico, Poland and Indonesia are expected to\nremain given their large absolute size. Inflows to China could be around $20bn, or\nequivalent to 1.5% of the aggregate central government bond market cap. Turkey,\nMalaysia, S. Africa, Thailand and Columbia could see outflows of $2.4bn-3.3bn each,\nwith the most expected impact on Thailand given its lower relative foreign ownership.\nWe would expect China to account for 4.4% of the Citi WGBI index. The biggest losers\nof market share will be the US, followed by Japan and Europe. Inflows to China could be\naround $87bn, or 6.5% of its CGB market cap. This would present a very bullish scenario\nfor CGBs, and the curve will likely steepen.\nMSCI inclusion – more about good will, then real flow\nAnother potential implication of China capital account opening is equity inflows. The\nMSCI has been considering the inclusion of China A-shares in its index. These are shares\nof local Chinese companies trading at the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange,\nwhose trading is so far limited to local investors (China: Will A-shares be included in\nMSCI in June this year?). The associated flows aren’t likely to be too large, so positive\nprice reaction is likely to come mostly from sentiment. The MSCI has discussed most\nrecently a 5% inclusion factor for A-shares, which would translate in an additional 1.1%\nMSCI weight of China in the index. The scope for additional foreign capital looks small,\nwhen considering that China already weighs 27% in the index. Our equity strategists\nestimate the total AUM tracking MSCI EM to approximately USD1.6tn (total market cap\nof the index is USD3.8tn), so that inflows upon inclusion would be roughly USD16bn.\nThe inclusion was delayed in June 2016, mainly due to obstacles regarding the quota\nallocation process, capital mobility restrictions and beneficial ownership.\nChart 60: Estimated loss of share if China is included in JPM GBI-EM\nGlobal Diversified\n0.0%\n-0.5%\n-1.0%\n-1.5%\n-2.0%\n0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%\nBRL\nMXN\nPLN\nIDR\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n-1.3%\n-1.2%\n-1.6%\n-1.5% -1.5%\nTRY\nMYR\n-0.9% -0.9%\n-0.1% 0.0%\n-0.3%\n-0.5%\nZAR\nTHB\nCOP\nHUF\nRUB\nRON\nPEN\nPHP\nCLP\nChart 61: Estimated loss of share if China is included into Citi WGBI\n0.0%\n-0.5%\n-1.0%\n-1.5%\n-2.0%\n-1.5%\nUSD\n-1.2%\n-1.1%\nJPY\nEUR\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n-0.1% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%\n-0.3%\nGBP\nCAD\nAUD\nMXN\nMYR\nDKK\nCHF\nPLN\nSEK\nSGD\nZAR\nNOK\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 35\nBest Carry Trades\nClaudio Irigoyen\nMLPF&S\nclaudio.irigoyen@baml.com\nMai Doan\nMLI (UK)\nmai.doan@baml.com\nRohit Garg\nMerrill Lynch (Singapore)\nr.garg@baml.com\nVadim Iaralov\nMLPF&S\nvadim.iaralov@baml.com\nCarry trades and blond swans\n• We do not expect traditional carry trades such as ARS and BRL to perform well in a\nstrong USD and increasing interest rates environment, so we focus on USD neutral\ncarry trades.\n• We like short EUR/RUB, short SGD/INR and long PEN/CLP. For more neutral\ncommodity exposure we like baskets of EUR, CAD, COP and CLP, AUD to fund RUB\nand PEN trades respectively.\nCarry is in the eye of the beholder\nTo focus on identifying best carry trades in the current environment of rising US\ninterest rates sounds counterintuitive at least. It is well know that carry trades perform\nnicely in risk-on periods as well as in a low volatility environment, which is the opposite\nof what we expect in the coming months. However, once proper factor exposure of\ncurrency returns is considered, smart carry reemerges as an interesting proposition. As\nwe have documented (Forecasting with Compass30), most of the variation in currency\nreturns can be explained by the first two principal components, which can be labeled as\ndollar and carry factor respectively, as they are highly correlated with USD and carry\nperformance.\nExpected returns of carry strategies are defined by interest rate differentials (ie, carry),\nassuming no change in spot exchange rates. Uncovered interest parity states that the\ncarry should be offset by a change in the spot of equal magnitude. However, empirical\nevidence (so called forward premium puzzle) clearly shows that carry trades are\nprofitable on average, which indicates the presence of currency risk premium. Since\nboth dollar and carry, are priced factors, any sensible carry strategy in an environment in\nwhich US rates are rising needs to hedge the USD exposure. This is just a necessary\nthough not a sufficient condition, since the carry factor is also correlated with global\nmeasures of risk. Interestingly, post-election currency losses is not as highly correlated\nwith carry, indicating that carry trades were not as a strong investment theme as it was\nthe case during the taper tantrum episode (Chart 62).\nChart 62: Carry didn’t drive currency reaction to US elections\n25\n1m carry (annualized)\nCurrency depreciation since Nov8 (rhs)\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\nARS\nIDR\nBRL\nRUB\nZAR\nPHP\nTRY\nINR\nCOP\nPEN\nMXN\nMYR\nCNY\nCNH\nCLP\nNZD\nAUD\nPLN\nTHB\nKRW\nTWD\nNOK\nSGD\nRON\nHKD\nCAD\nHUF\nGBP\nILS\nCZK\nJPY\nEUR\nSEK\nCHF\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n15\n12\n9\n6\n3\n0\n-3\nChart 63: Asia and LatAm display the highest risk-adjusted carry\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\nIDR\nARS\nPHP\nCNY\nINR\nCNH\nBRL\nTRY\nRUB\nPEN\nMYR\nZAR\nCOP\nCLP\nMXN\nTHB\nNZD\nAUD\nPLN\nKRW\nTWD\nNOK\nSGD\nCAD\nRON\nHUF\nGBP\nJPY\nCZK\nSEK\nEUR\nILS\nCHF\nHKD\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n1m carry (annualized) / 1m implied ATM vol\n1m carry (annualized) / max 1m DD (5y, rhs)\n36 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nCharacterizing carry\nEfficient carry strategies involve buying and selling dynamic portfolios of currencies\nwith certain risk characteristics. Carry strategies are supposed to work better over long\ninvestment horizons, so that the cushion provided by the carry compensates for the\ncurrency volatility through mean reversion.\nHere, we analyze carry from a different perspective, as our goal is to identify standalone\nattractive carry opportunities. We define the investment horizon to end 1Q17. We sort\ncurrencies based on risk-adjusted carry. We then characterize the factor exposure of\ncurrency returns, isolating global and idiosyncratic sources of risks, in order to identify\nsmart carry trades that are not highly exposed to a massive re-pricing of global factors,\nsuch as US rates, USD, commodity prices and global risk aversion. We identify carry\ntrades that have low exposure to global factors, in particular the USD factor, and offer\nattractive risk-rewards.\nNot surprisingly, purely based on carry considerations, EM currencies appear more\nattractive than DM ones, which are mostly candidates for funding currencies. However,\ncarry trades returns are highly volatile, exhibit negative skewness and fat tails. Even\ncontrolling for different measures of risk such as volatility or maximum drawdown, and\naccording to this criteria only, we find that EM currencies are the most attractive, in\nparticular ARS, BRL in LatAm, RUB, TRY and ZAR in EEMEA and INR, IDR and CNY in\nAsia (Chart 63).\nEven though volatility and drawdowns can be useful measures of risk, they don’t say\nmuch about the exposure to different risk factors. Since carry trade strategies are\nusually very sensitive to global factors, we study the cross sectional exposure of\ncurrencies to key global factors: commodity prices, global risk aversion and US yields (as\na proxy of global yields). We report the R2 of regressions of two years of weekly returns\non the above mentioned global factors, for the last two years and the years 2013-2014\nfor the sake of comparison (Chart 64).\nWe find that currencies in LatAm and EEMEA are more exposed to global factors than in\nAsia. Interestingly, LatAm and EMEA currencies are more sensitive to shocks in\ncommodity prices and risk aversion, while in Asia the shocks to monetary policy are the\nmost important ones (Chart 65). Within DM currencies, AUD and NOK are the two\ncurrencies most exposed to global factors. Ideally, we seek for currencies with high riskadjusted\ncarry and low exposure to global factors. Under such a metric, ARS, BRL, RUB\nand INR stand out as the best investment currencies, while EUR, CHF, JPY, KRW and\nTWD are the best funding currencies. However, this filter is not enough in the current\nvolatile environment.\nChart 64: LatAm is more exposed to global factors than Asia\n0.6\nDepend on global factors\n0.5\n0.4\nRSQ '16 RSQ '14\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\nChart 65: Sensitivity to global factors across regions\n0.8\nNormalized beta of global factors\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\nMonetary\nCommodities\nEquities\n0\nCOP\nCAD\nMXN\nLATAM\nEMEA\nRUB\nZAR\nJPY\nNOK\nCLP\nAUD\nBRL\nIDR\nTRY\nMYR\nCZK\nINR\nSEK\nEUR\nSGD\nASIA\nNZD\nTHB\nRON\nPEN\nHUF\nPLN\nPHP\nCHF\nILS\nKRW\nTWD\nGBP\nHKD\nCNY\nARS\n-0.4\nCOP\nCAD\nMXN\nLATAM\nEMEA\nRUB\nZAR\nJPY\nNOK\nCLP\nAUD\nBRL\nIDR\nTRY\nMYR\nCZK\nINR\nSEK\nEUR\nSGD\nASIA\nNZD\nTHB\nRON\nPEN\nHUF\nPLN\nPHP\nCHF\nILS\nKRW\nTWD\nGBP\nHKD\nCNY\nARS\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 37\nThe role of fundamentals\nFrom a purely mechanical perspective, we could stop the analysis here and choose those\ncurrencies with better risk-reward prospects according to the metrics so far described.\nHowever, in order to analyze carry trades with relatively short investment horizon, we\nneed to complement our analysis with our views on future exchange rates dynamics.\nWe expect US rates to continue moving higher and the USD to strengthen across the\nboard due to easier US fiscal policy and significant uncertainty regarding foreign policy.\nIn EM, we think LatAm is the region that will suffer the most in the new global scenario,\nfollowed by Asia. We find EEMEA relatively more resilient to US driven shocks. We want\nto avoid countries with high financing needs (i.e., high fiscal and current account\ndeficits). We also prefer trades with neutral commodity exposure. Since carry trades\ntend to underperform when US rates are moving higher and the USD strengthens, we\nwant at least to avoid USD funded carry trades, crowded carry trades and currency\ncrosses highly exposed to the USD factor. Hedging the USD factor leaves us with the\npure carry exposure, which by being a price factor, is also related to standard measures\nof risk, as well as idiosyncratic factors.\nBest carry trade: Cherry picking among rotten cherries\nGiven our views, and focusing on those trades where ex-ante high carry is consistent\nwith ex-ante expected returns, we choose our best carry trades across EM and DM.\nSince DM currencies offer very low carry vs the USD, there are not many attractive carry\nopportunities in DM in a strong USD environment, so much so that the most attractive\ncarry proposition is simply to go long USD/JPY. Since this trade is mostly predicated on\na strong USD view and is being developed in other sections of this report we refer the\nreader to those sections (please see: USD/JPY will the main beneficiary of Trump win,\nFX: GOP sweep emboldens core USD/JPY view, Long EUR/JPYAsia: short JPY/KRW).\nTherefore, we focus mostly on EM or EM/DM carry trades.\nEEMEA: short EUR/RUB\nWe like selling EUR/RUB (spot 69.28, target 66.15, stop 71.02). We see EEMEA as\nrelatively more resilient to higher US rates, though with some heterogeneity within the\nregion. On the one hand, high current account deficit countries like Turkey or South\nAfrica should continue suffering from a re-pricing of risk. On the other hand, CEE\ncountries are expected to some more resilience. One currency we find particularly\nattractive is the Russian ruble, which still offers an attractive risk-adjusted carry,\ncontrolling for standard measures of risk such as implied volatility and maximum\ndrawdown. The outcome of the US election should remove some risk premium from\nRussian assets as the geopolitical backdrop improves. Economic activity is expected to\npick up in 2017. A hawkish central bank, coupled with a favorable external position and\nan energy-driven current account surplus will likely limit its exposure to a reversal in\ncapital flows.\nOn the geopolitical side, we expect Russian foreign policy to become more conciliatory\nChart 66: Oil prices are a major risk factor\nChart 67: Russia tends to be more market-friendly with lower oil\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\nRUB/(EUR,CAD,COP) Jan 4 '13 =100\nRUB/EUR Jan 4 '13 =100\nBrent oil (RHS)\n0.0\nJan-13 Jul-13 Jan-14 Jul-14 Jan-15 Jul-15 Jan-16 Jul-16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n150\n100\n50\n0\n100\n50\n0\nOil price, $/bbl 10y MA\nPrivatization,\nGeorgia\nGaidar reforms war\nStart of\nYukos\nPerestroika\ncase\nAfganistan war\nJan-70\nMay-72\nSep-74\nJan-77\nMay-79\nSep-81\nJan-84\nMay-86\nSep-88\nJan-91\nMay-93\nSep-95\nJan-98\nMay-00\nSep-02\nJan-05\nMay-07\nSep-09\nJan-12\nMay-14\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nUkraine\ncrisis\nUS-Russia\n“Reset”\n38 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nand less disruptive for markets, in particular given the expected improved foreign\nrelations with the US (Chart 67). However, the currency remains overvalued and highly\nexposed to global factors, in particular oil price, and positioning is crowded. Despite our\nforecast is for USD/RUB to remain around 63 in 1Q17, we prefer to mitigate the abovementioned\nrisks by choosing a more favorable funding currency.\nIf liquidity is a major consideration, we prefer to use the EUR as a funding currency,\nwhich offers negative carry vs the USD, and gives the ruble the best risk-adjusted carry\nacross all potential funding currencies. In addition to the already seen impact on US\nrates, Trump’s victory implies that political risks are becoming increasingly important in\nEurope, with the Italian referendum in December and elections in Netherlands, Germany\nand France in 2017. This scenario strengthens our call for a six-month extension to ECB\nQE at the current pace. We expect the EUR/USD to trade at 1.05 by end 1Q17.\nSince short EUR/RUB is still exposed to much lower oil prices, an alternative way to\nexpress the trade is to use a basket of euro, Colombian peso and Canadian dollar as\nfunding basket (Chart 66). The COP remains overvalued, the central bank is expected to\nease monetary policy as the economy decelerates and oil represents 35% of Colombian\nexports. We expect the COP to depreciate 2.5% by end 1Q17. Carry, on the other hand,\nis higher than EUR and CAD. The CAD offers very low carry and we forecast a 1.5%\ndepreciation by 1Q17 vs the USD. The economy keeps displaying weak growth and we\nexpect the Bank of Canada likely to cut rates and maintain the accommodative stance of\nmonetary policy.\nAsia: short SGD/INR\nWe like short SGD/INR (spot 47.96, target 47, stop 48.44). While the performance of\nAsia FX can be influenced by broader risk conditions, we expect most to weaken vs. the\nUSD. The Korean won and the Singapore dollar, as well as the Taiwanese dollar for\ninstance stand out as being the most sensitive to a stronger USD, as they act as a high\nbeta proxy for CNY, which we expect to continue depreciating in this new high US rates\nenvironment. Others like Indonesian rupiah and Malaysian ringgit are more sensitive to\nhigher USD rates. Consequently, outflows from these countries will adversely impact the\nrespective FX. That said, Bank Indonesia has built good amount of reserves to prevent\nrupiah from weakening excessively. Moreover, tax amnesty related repatriation flows\nand global bond issuance is still expected to come in December, which should also\nsupport the rupiah.\nHistorically, large US tax cuts have been followed by a widening of the US current\naccount deficit driven by higher imports. This supported Asia export growth and\nexchange rates, especially after the Bush tax cuts. However, this time could be different\npartly because US household spending has been shifting towards non-tradable services.\nMore importantly, Trump’s policy platform itself is geared towards reducing dependence\nupon foreign goods and services (Chart 68).\nChart 68: Export exposure to the US across EM Asia\n20\nExports to the US in 2015 (% of GDP)\n15\n10\n5\n0\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nChart 69: S$NEER has depreciated 50bp below par since Oct MPS\n130\n125\n120\n115\n110\n105\nIndex\nApr-08\nOct-08\nApr-09\nOct-09\nApr-10\nOct-10\nApr-11\nOct-11\nApr-12\nOct-12\nApr-13\nOct-13\nApr-14\nOct-14\nApr-15\nOct-15\nApr-16\nOct-16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, Bloomberg\nBofA-ML SGD NEER\nlower end of band\nmid-point\nupper end of band\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 39\nAt this juncture, the Indian rupee seems to be the only one in the region that is expected\nto display a much lower sensitivity to US rates, outperforming others within Asia. We\nexpect the Monetary Authority of Singapore to keep the SGD NEER in the weaker side\nof the band for the next few months, which reduces the downside risk for the trade\n(Chart 69). We like the INR as the preferred long, followed by the IDR, as they offer high\nrisk-adjusted carry, central banks are interested in keeping their currencies stable,\ncurrent account deficits are bounded, and the currencies are not expensive relative to\nlong term fundamentals. The main risk of the trade is of higher oil prices, and\nconsiderable reversal of capital flows. Apart from that, a change in the behavior of\nReserve Bank of India it terms of managing INR to accumulate international reserves is\nalso a risk.\nLatAm: long PEN/CLP\nWe like long PEN/CLP (spot 195.7, target 200, stop 195.5). LatAm is the most\nexposed region within EM to global factors. Traditional carry trade candidates like the\nBrazilian real and the Argentina peso are no longer attractive given the still fragile fiscal\nstance in both countries. Local positioning in BRL has proven to be heavier than\nthought, and we expect the currency to continue weakening until we observe some\nstabilization in US rates. The Brazilian real is still overvalued and the economy will be\nnegatively affected since its strategy to gradually reduce budget deficits is based on low\nglobal rates, capital inflows and higher domestic growth. In the case of the Argentine\npeso, despite showing some detachment from global factors and some positive inflows\ndue to the tax amnesty, we think the currency needs to weaken given the recent\ndepreciation of the BRL and its current overvaluation as well as the government fiscal\nneeds for 2017, which is an important electoral year. Therefore, we remain neutral on\nthese currencies.\nA more modest but more interesting carry trade within LatAm in an environment of\nhigher US rates is to be long the Peruvian sol, funded with the Chilean peso, in order to\nmake the trade more neutral to commodity exposure. The Peruvian economy is expected\nto continue growing at rates above 4% due to strong mining activity; the new\ngovernment will likely implement expansionary fiscal policy and has room to finance it.\nThe exchange rate is close to its equilibrium value based on terms-of-trade and\nproductivity. In fact, we expect the currency to appreciate in real terms if growth\nrecovers as predicted. The currency still offers a decent carry. We forecast a nominal\ndepreciation but below the forward. The central bank has a strong preference for low\ncurrency volatility and would be ready to intervene in case of a disorderly depreciation,\nas it has been already the case in the last few days with small interventions in the\nforward market.\nOn the other hand, Chile’s growth remains anemic and the economy is expected to\ncontinue growing sub 2% in 2017 (Chart 71). The CLP is overvalued but recent flows\nChart 70: Copper prices are a major risk factor\nChart 71: Relative growth to favor Peru going forward\n400\n350\n300\n250\nCopper prices\n200 CLP (rhs, Jan2012 =100)\nPEN (rhs, Jan2012 =100)\n150\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n230\npen/clp growth diff (rhs)\n220\n210\n200\n190\n180\n170\n160\n150\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Haver\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n40 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\n\nfrom large domestic pension funds and the recovery in the price of copper explain the\nrelative resilience of the currency (Chart 70). Given the low carry, CLP offers an\nattractive alternative as a funding currency as the portfolio rebalancing of pension funds\nis expected to slow down. We expect the currency to weaken further in 1Q17 as interest\nrates move higher in the US, and we do not expect the central bank to intervene, as it\nwould likely be the case in Peru. In order to reduce the carry cost of the funding\ncurrency without losing the neutral exposure to metals, we like a basket of the Chilean\npeso with the Australian dollar.

We highlight four such opportunities in this\nsection, specifically: 1) US deregulation; 2) return of Euro zone risk premia; 3) Chinalinked\ncommodity prices weakening sharply; and 4) Japan’s yield curve targeting\ntriggering a steeper curve and volatility increase.\nChart 72: Biggest tail-risk, percentage of respondents in Global Fund Manager Survey\nOct-16\nEU disintegration\nSep-16\nAug-16\nJul-16\nJun-16\nMay-16\nApr-16\nMar-16\nFeb-16\nJan-16\nDec-15\nNov-15\nOct-15\nRepublican wins White House\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nRepublican wins White House\nRepublican wins White House\nBrexit\nBrexit\nQuantitative Failure\nQuantitative Failure\nUS recession\nTail risk 1: US deregulation\nNormalized swap spreads, cross-currency basis & coupon vs principal STRIPS\nDeregulation is a key focus for the incoming administration, and Dodd-Frank is a major\npotential target. Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner under George W Bush, has\nbeen named to lead transition strategy on financial regulation. Atkins has been\nvehemently critical of Dodd-Frank since its inception, and in a statement to the Senate\nGlobal FMS biggest \"tail risk\"\n(past 12 months)\nChina recession\nChina recession\nChina recession\nChina recession\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50%\n42 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nin 2011 called the law a calamity that increases business uncertainty and undermines\ngrowth. Under Atkins, the transition team posted a statement that it will be “working to\ndismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic\ngrowth and job creation.\" At this point there are no details on what parts of Dodd-Frank\nare most likely to be repealed, but Republican financial policy leaders appear promarkets\nand have flagged free movement of capital via open markets as the best policy\nfor economic growth and risk transparency.\nThere are several dislocations across markets today that we think have a chance of\nnormalizing in the tail-risk event that deregulation results in increased availability of\nleverage and ability to take more risk. We have discussed these dislocations as resulting\nin part from the lack of ability of hedge funds and other relative-value traders to access\nenough balance sheet at a low enough cost to help these trades normalize. The top\ntrades we could see benefitting from the return of leverage would be:\n• Normalization of swap spreads; balance-sheet intensive Treasuries, both nominal\nand TIPS, are very cheap versus OIS and Libor swap rates.\n• Normalization of cross-currency basis swaps, which currently allow USD-based\ninvestors the ability to buy very cheap EUR- and JPY-denominated assets via the\nbasis swap.\n• Normalization of coupon STRIPS versus principal STRIPS as these yield differentials\nare near their all-time wides, particularly in the 2030-38 maturity bucket.\nAs a tail risk for deregulation, we like buying 30y swap spreads, a credit-risk-free\nfloating-rate US Treasury asset that provides 3m Libor + 56bp annually, which is about\n100bp cheap to pre-crisis levels. Swap spreads could also benefit from deregulation that\nremoves cash and Treasury bonds from the leverage ratio requirements, which would\nprovide the ability of the dealer community to more easily absorb Treasury supply in the\nprimary and secondary markets.\nThe main risk is that policy changes retain strict capital requirements, which would\ncontinue to limit the availability of leverage. For example, the Financial Choice Act, a\nproduct of Texas Representative Jeb Hensarling's team, would provide banks an offramp\noption to all Basel 3 requirements as long as banks hold a 10% capital ratio. This\nplan would probably decrease the availability of leverage, and could also result in\nreduced demand for short-dated Treasuries in HQLA portfolios. Another risk to 30y\nswap spread normalization in particular would be a material increase in deficit spending\nas part of a fiscal stimulus package. This would likely further cheapen Treasuries versus\nswaps and other benchmark interest rates.\nTrade recommendation: Buy 30y Treasuries versus 30y matched Libor swap at\n3mL+56bp. Target 3mL + 0bp, stop loss 3mL+75bp.\nTail risk 2: Comeback of Eurozone risk premia\nEZ risk hedges: 30s50s flatteners in BTPs, buy EUR/HUF vol\nIn Europe, the biggest market risk for 2017 is arguably a comeback of stress on\nperipheral sovereigns. The next 12 months provide plenty of triggers, with increasing\nconcerns about the ability of ECB to continue with QE, and an intense political season\nahead (referendum in Italy on 4 Dec, and elections in France and Germany in 2017).\nAs hedges to Eurozone risks, we recommend buying 30s50s flatteners in BTPs as the\ncheapest way to express a bearish view on the periphery, and buying EUR/HUF vol as a\nproxy for Euro instability with better pricing than EUR/USD vol.\nConcerns on EU politics and the ECB would likely lead to a switch of market focus from\nmonetary policy to fundamentals. The periphery would be hurt by this new focus: public\ndebt to GDP remains very high, and the low debt service costs enjoyed in the past five\nyears favored debt accumulation, rather than debt reduction (Chart 73).

ECB easing has\npushed Eurozone interest rates lower despite worsening public finances (Chart 74).\nParticipation in the QE program has been a strong determinant of low long-term rates,\nas shown by the tightening of the periphery vs CEE. Hungary, Poland and Romania have\nbeen yielding 3-3.5% in the past year, while Italy remained constantly below 2%. If\nstress comes back, the gap will close.\nWithin the periphery, Italy is the most vulnerable. Fundamentals are the worst in the\nregion, only comparable to Portugal, which trades 160bp above it. Political risks also\nremain high, with the referendum providing some downside risk to the prime minister.\nThe market is apparently reaching the same conclusion: during the most recent global\nbonds sell-off (20 Sep-14 Nov), Italy widened 95bp, while Spain widened 70bp, in line\nwith CEE, despite the higher beta nature of the latter and the higher FX risk. Still, there\nmay be room for further widening: the 10y spread to Germany widened in the current\nmove, but is still lower than it has been the three years following the latest Italian\npolitical crisis. Our European rates team argued this summer that the rally in Italy\nspreads was far from fundamental. Flatteners in the 30s50s area look the best hedge as\n50y are not eligible for QE, and term premia in the 2-31y sector would increase if QE\nwas to end. Also, in times of sovereign debt stress, the curve tends to invert, further\nsupporting long-end flatteners. Total carry is 1bp per month, making it cheaper and less\nsensitive to timing of stress than an outright short bond position.\nOn further EZ stress, the euro would weaken and euro vol rise. While a less dovish ECB\nwould be euro-positive, peripheral stress would ignite concerns on the monetary union,\nand ultimately weaken the euro (as in Dec 2011). A cleaner hedge is buying EUR/HUF\nvol, as it proxies EUR/USD vol but has moved less so far. HUF options are historically\nvery reactive to EZ stress, but the increase in vol lagged EUR/USD post-elections, and\nEUR/PLN vol has been higher in the past two years due to higher perceived risks in\nPoland (Chart 75). In Dec 2011, the vol spike in the three crosses had been the same.\nCEE rates tend to widen in times of Eurozone stress, but their fundamentals are much\nmore solid, so further EZ stress may bring opportunities to buy dips. CEE capitalized the\npast five year much better, with fiscal consolidation in Hungary, balanced budget in\nCzech Republic, and low debt/GDP ratios in Poland. Also, the growth picture is much\nmore rosy, making leverage much more manageable.\nTrade recommendation: Buy 50y BTPs vs 30y BTPS at 30bp, targeting -8bp and\nwith stop at 55bp. Risk is ECB QE continues and peripheral risk premium stays low.\n44 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nTail risk 3: China-led commodity weakness\nCommodity collapse hedge: buy AUD/USD 6m 0.67 digital put\nMetal and bulk commodity prices have skyrocketed in anticipation of infrastructure\nspending in the US, We are wary of this rally: tax cuts are likely to be the first line of\nfiscal stimulus and potentially easier to get through Congress than sizeable\ninfrastructure spending, which in any case will take a longer time to impact commodity\ndemand (allowing for supply adjustments). Perhaps most importantly, China is still the\nswing factor for global commodity prices and the risks here remain to the downside.\nThe recent dramatic rise for China-linked bulk commodity prices, especially coal, has\nbeen driven by a combination of supply and demand imbalances (China floods, pit\nclosures and inventory shortages) and an apparent rise in speculative activity in futures\nmarkets that has already drawn attention from regulators (Chart 76). Our resource\nanalysts have raised forecasts but still see moderation over 2017 (Chart 77). The futures\nforward curve has already moved into backwardation. We see iron ore prices back at\nUSD50/t in 2017 compared to a current spot price of USD74.\nWhile global reflation might be positive for commodities, there are reasons for caution:\n• We expect Chinese property investment, the most commodity-intensive sector of\nthe economy, to slow in 2017.\n• Sizeable RMB depreciation would be an additional deflationary impulse for\nindustrial commodities.\n• There will be a supply response as current prices bring uneconomic producers back\non line, admittedly with a lag.\n• There is potential for trade friction to impact regional trade while higher US rates\nare already impacting regional EM currencies. Australia is especially exposed to\nintra-regional trade and resource demand from the region.\nPersistent supply/demand imbalances ahead of Chinese New Year might delay\ncommodity weakness until after 1Q17, especially for coking coal due to a preference for\nthermal coal supplies over the Chinese winter. However, the risk of a sharp reversal\nbeyond is worth hedging against given the demand dynamics in China, most obviously\nthrough the AUD. While short-dated implied volatility rose following the US election, the\nrisk-reversal skew remains high as a percentage of implied volatility relative to G10\npairs. This suggests hedging via AUD/USD digital puts is appropriate, in our view.\nTrade recommendation: Buy 6m AUD/USD 0.67 digital put, entry: 10% (spot\nreference: 0.7550). Risk is global demand recovery provides support to commodity\nprices.\nChart 76: Bulk commodity spot prices\nUSD/t\n400\nIron Ore (china)\n300\nAus Thermal Coal\nHardcoal (Coking) spot\n200\n100\n0\n11 12 13 14 15 16 17\nSource: Bof A Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nChart 77: China Coking coal futures and BAML forecasts\nOur 2017 forecasts for Liulin No.4 Coking coal are averages for 1H and 2H\nRMB/t\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\nSource: Bof A Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nCoking Coal Future (lhs)\nFutures Curve\nBAML Forecast\nVolume (rhs, 000s contracts)\n400\nJan-16 May-16 Sep-16 Jan-17 May-17 Sep-17 Jan-18\n3200\n2800\n2400\n2000\n1600\n1200\n800\n400\n0\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 45\nTail risk 4: BoJ triggers curve steepening and vol rise\nBoJ keeps yield curve anchored out to 10y: 1y10s20s conditional bear steepener\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) has faced a tough 2016. Having switched its policy target from\nquantity to interest rates at its September Monetary Policy Meeting, it tacitly\nacknowledged that negative rates and JGB purchases were potentially approaching their\nlimit in terms of policy effectiveness. Inflation expectations fell and the yen\nstrengthened as a consequence as the market got accustomed to fading dovish\npronouncements from the Bank of Japan. BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda himself said\n\"Central banks are, admittedly, not omnipotent.\"\nThe BoJ introduced yield curve control, taking into consideration negative effects of\ngreat decline in yields and curve flattening on financial institution earnings or financial\nmarkets. If the BoJ keeps purchasing at the current rate, however, yields will sooner or\nlater feel downward pressure. We believe the BoJ is likely to reduce its long-term JGB\npurchase gradually. For the time being, JGB yield guidelines are probably around 0% for\nthe 10yr, 0.4% for the 20yr, and 0.5% for the 30yr JGB.\nHowever, the BoJ appears to be concerned about the deterioration of financial\ninstitution earnings caused by flattening of the yield curve. Kuroda said that even if\nsuperlong-term yields rose slightly, he did not believe they would have to be lowered. He\nwent on to say he was also giving consideration to investors in superlong-term bonds,\nand that he did not think it was good for the yield curve to get continually flatter. Based\non these and other remarks, we expect long-term JGB purchase operations to be\nreduced and the curve to gradually steepen (Rates forecast: Attention on BoJ operations\nwhen yields decline).\nBefore that can happen, however, preconditions most likely include steady progress in\nUS rate hikes, avoidance of excessive yen appreciation, and some degree of recovery in\nthe inflation rate. With a Republican clean sweep, US fiscal easing is now a foregone\nconclusion and “Higher rates and higher dollar” may support our view for yen rates. If\nJGB purchase operations were reduced and yen rates rose in the wake of higher US\nTreasury yields and USD/JPY appreciation, that could easily be explained by\nfundamentals.\nYen rates volatility is still low; however, purchasing cuts by the BoJ could add to\nvolatility risk amid declining liquidity in the super long-end (Chart 78). Even if risk-off\nsentiment pushes down the yield curve, the BoJ may lower the 10yr JGB yield target\nfrom zero to keep the curve steep. This kind of policy change also could increase\nvolatility. In either case, the 10yr is expected to be anchored and movement is expected\nin the long end. We believe 1y10s20s conditional bear steepener may mitigate this risk.\nTrade recommendation: Long 5bn 1y20y @0.62% (atm+11bp) payer vs Short 9.9bn\n1y10y @0.18% (atm) payer. This position is zero cost, PV01 neutral, and zero carry.\nRisk is the curve remains flat due to a deflationary backdrop.\nChart 78: JPY Swap 10y and 20y rate and 1y20y volatility\n1.2\n(%) JPY Swap 10y JPY Swap 20y 1y20y Volatility (RHS) (bp)\n60\n1\n50\n0.8\n40\n0.6\n0.4\n30\n0.2\n20\n0\n10\n-0.2\n0\nNov-15 Feb-16 May-16 Aug-16 Nov-16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n46 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nBest Technical Trades\nPaul Ciana, CMT\nMLPF&S\npaul.ciana@baml.com\nTechnical trends for Trump\n• Bullish USD: Breadth and technicals favor USD.

We\nrecommending buying a NZD/USD 5m .69/.66 put spread 1x1.5 for 43 USD pips (off of\n.7100 spot).\nChart 84: NZD/USD daily chart\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n50 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nBond Yield Forecasts\nTable 7: Quarter-end bond yield forecasts\nLatest 4Q16 1Q17 2Q17 3Q17 4Q17\nUSA 3m Libor 0.91 1.05 1.05 1.25 1.30 1.50\n2y T-Note 0.98 1.10 1.35 1.50 1.60 1.65\n5y T-Note 1.64 1.85 2.10 2.15 2.20 2.25\n10y T-Note 2.21 2.35 2.55 2.60 2.65 2.65\n30y T-Bond 2.95 3.10 3.30 3.30 3.35 3.35\n2y Swap 1.23 1.30 1.53 1.66 1.75 1.80\n5y Swap 1.68 1.88 2.10 2.15 2.20 2.25\n10y Swap 2.07 2.23 2.41 2.44 2.49 2.49\nGermany 3m Euribor -0.31 -0.30 -0.30 -0.30 -0.33 -0.32\n2y BKO -0.62 -0.60 -0.60 -0.55 -0.50 -0.45\n5y OBL -0.34 -0.35 -0.30 -0.25 -0.20 -0.10\n10y DBR 0.30 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.65\n30y DBR 0.93 1.05 1.10 1.15 1.15 1.15\n2y Swap -0.13 -0.14 -0.16 -0.13 -0.06 -0.02\n5y Swap 0.14 0.12 0.16 0.21 0.27 0.36\n10y Swap 0.69 0.81 0.85 0.89 0.92 1.00\nJapan 3m Libor -0.07 -0.03 -0.03 -0.03 -0.03 -0.03\n2y JGB -0.17 -0.20 -0.20 -0.20 -0.20 -0.15\n5y JGB -0.11 -0.15 -0.15 -0.13 -0.12 -0.10\n10y JGB 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\n2y Swap 0.01 -0.07 -0.07 -0.07 -0.07 0.00\n5y Swap 0.04 -0.05 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.04\n10y Swap 0.15 0.12 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15\nU.K. 3m Libor 0.40 0.40 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25\n2y UKT 0.22 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20\n5y UKT 0.66 0.70 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.90\n10y UKT 1.40 1.50 1.60 1.65 1.70 1.75\n30y UKT 2.04 2.10 2.15 2.20 2.25 2.30\n2y Swap 0.67 0.65 0.65 0.60 0.55 0.50\n5y Swap 0.96 1.00 1.10 1.15 1.20 1.20\n10y Swap 1.34 1.55 1.70 1.75 1.80 1.85\nAustralia 3m BBSW 1.76 1.70 1.70 1.70 1.80 1.80\n2y ACGB 1.77 1.90 1.95 2.00 2.05 2.10\n5y ACGB 2.16 2.30 2.40 2.45 2.50 2.60\n10y ACGB 2.66 2.80 2.95 3.05 3.10 3.10\n3y Swap 2.22 2.00 2.10 2.15 2.20 2.20\n10y Swap 2.81 2.95 3.10 3.20 3.25 3.25\nCanada 2y Govt 0.66 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.40\n5y Govt 0.94 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.70\n10y Govt 1.52 1.50 1.40 1.40 1.35 1.35\n2y Swap 1.00 1.04 0.94 0.84 0.74 0.74\n5y Swap 1.29 1.35 1.25 1.15 1.05 1.05\n10y Swap 1.78 1.76 1.66 1.66 1.61 1.61\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nGlobal Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 51\nGlobal FX Forecasts\nTable 8: Quarterly forecasts – G10 currencies\nSpot Dec-16 Mar-17 Jun-17 Sep-17 Dec-17 Mar-18 Jun-18 Sep-18 Dec-18\nG3\nEUR-USD 1.08 1.08 1.05 1.02 1.02 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.10\nUSD-JPY 108 108 112 115 117 120 117 115 112 110\nEUR-JPY 117 117 118 117 119 126 124 123 121 121\nDollar Bloc\nUSD-CAD 1.35 1.36 1.38 1.40 1.41 1.43 1.43 1.41 1.40 1.40\nAUD-USD 0.76 0.74 0.73 0.72 0.71 0.70 0.70 0.71 0.73 0.75\nNZD-USD 0.71 0.70 0.69 0.68 0.68 0.67 0.67 0.68 0.70 0.71\nEurope\nEUR-GBP 0.87 0.88 0.91 0.89 0.88 0.88 0.88 0.87 0.86 0.85\nGBP-USD 1.24 1.23 1.15 1.15 1.16 1.19 1.20 1.23 1.26 1.29\nEUR-CHF 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 1.11 1.12 1.12 1.13 1.13 1.15\nUSD-CHF 0.99 1.00 1.04 1.08 1.09 1.07 1.06 1.06 1.05 1.05\nEUR-SEK 9.86 9.50 9.40 9.30 9.20 9.15 9.10 9.00 8.90 8.90\nUSD-SEK 9.14 8.80 8.95 9.12 9.02 8.71 8.58 8.41 8.24 8.09\nEUR-NOK 9.08 9.00 8.90 8.80 8.70 8.60 8.50 8.50 8.40 8.40\nUSD-NOK 8.41 8.33 8.48 8.63 8.53 8.19 8.02 7.94 7.78 7.64\nForecast as of Nov-15-2016.

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n52 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\nOptions Risk Statement\nPotential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk\nUnlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by definition\ngoverned by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with general options\ntrading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can\noccur in a short period.\nInvestor suitability\nThe use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are\nconsidered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are\nencouraged to become familiar with the \"Characteristics and Risks of Standardized\nOptions\" (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult\nwith a FINRA Registered Options Principal.\nFor detailed information regarding the risks involved with investing in listed options:\nhttp://www.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp.\nValuation & risk\nBrazil (BRAZIL)\nWe are Marketweight Brazil's EXD with currently wide spreads compensating for the\nrisks. The political crisis concerns investors and growth has been weaker than expected.\nHowever, spreads are quite high compared to LatAm investment grades. There are\npositive and negative tail risks for growth, as a resolution to the political paralysis could\nbring confidence back up quickly and improve the economic backdrop. With this positive\ntail risk, and a stronger fiscal adjustment in 2016, economic recovery could start in\n2Q16. On the downside, pressures on GDP could increase if the political scenario\ndeteriorates further, with the government failing to approve fiscal measures and/or\nBrazil shifting to a heterodox policy.\nColombia (COLOM)\nSpreads, which have widened this year adequately compensate investors for the risk, in\nour view, and leads us to our Marketweight view. Downside risks are a rapid inflation\nacceleration from pass-through effects, which would be a difficult problem for\nmacroeconomic policy. Also oil price weakness raises risk of recession. Fiscal and\nexternal difficulties generate incentives to relax the fiscal rule. Upside risks are a rise in\ncommodity prices and stronger than expected growth.\nMexico (MEX)\nMexico's tight spreads fairly reflect the better quality of Mexican debt compared to\nmost of LatAm, in our view. We forecast Mexico's activity growth to remain in the 2-3%\nrange. Downside risks are lower growth in the US, lower oil prices and slower domestic\noil production. A disorderly normalization of US monetary policy is a risk to Mexico's\nfinancial stability as well. Upside risks are higher oil prices and stronger US growth.\nTurkey (TURKEY)\nWe are Overweight as Turkey Eurobonds lagged peers due to heightened political noise\nduring the summer. Since Moody's downgraded the sovereign, all negative impact of the\nattempted coup seems to be priced and we think that bonds offer value vs peers.\nDownside risks are stronger outflows than expected and heightened political noise.\nUpside risks include a generalized rally on the back of more positive global backdrop.\nAnalyst Certification\nWe, David Woo, Adarsh Sinha, Arko Sen, Claudio Irigoyen, Jane Brauer, Kamal Sharma,\nMark Capleton, Paul Ciana, CMT and Ralf Preusser, CFA, hereby certify that the views\neach of us has expressed in this research report accurately reflect each of our respective\npersonal views about the subject securities and issuers.
