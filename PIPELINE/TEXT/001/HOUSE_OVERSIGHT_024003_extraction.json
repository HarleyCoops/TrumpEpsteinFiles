EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFUND OVERVIEW\nNew Leaf Ventures III, L.P. (“NLV-III” or the “Fund”) is being formed by New Leaf Venture\nPartners, L.L.C. (“New Leaf” or the “Management Company”), an established and proven\nleader in health care technology investing. NLV-III will be the seventh private equity fund\nfocused on venture and growth stage investments in healthcare and life sciences companies\nraised by the partners of New Leaf. NLV-III is the successor fund to New Leaf Ventures I, L.P.\n(“NLV-I”) and New Leaf Ventures II, L.P. (“NLV-II”), which raised capital commitments of\n$310 million and $450 million respectively. The New Leaf funds follow four Sprout Capital\nfunds that included over $1.0 billion of investments in healthcare technology companies. 1 In\ntotal, the New Leaf team has invested over $1.6 billion and have generated one of the industry’s\nleading track records by consistently outperforming their peers in the healthcare venture capital\nmarket (based on Cambridge Associates benchmarks 2 ) and exceeding relevant public market\nindices by substantial margins. 3,4\nThe Fund will seek to invest in a diversified portfolio composed of an estimated 24 to 28\nhealthcare technology companies, most of which will be U.S. based and at the product\ndevelopment or commercialization phase. Fund investments will typically take the form of\nventure capital or growth capital transactions in private companies, or as structured\ntransactions in small capitalization public companies. The Fund will establish meaningful\nownership positions and in most cases will actively manage the investments with\nrepresentation on the boards of directors. The Fund will seek to generate returns that\nsignificantly outperform relevant public market equity indices by creating a portfolio that\noptimally balances the risks, timelines, and capital intensity associated with developing and\ncommercializing innovative healthcare technologies with the financial market realities that are\nthe backdrop for a venture capital fund focused on this sector.\nThe Fund is targeting aggregate capital commitments from limited partners of\n$375 million.\nTHE NEW LEAF TEAM\nNew Leaf is one of the most respected, successful, and established brands in healthcare\ntechnology investing, a reputation built over the last 18 years by a highly experienced and\nstable team of partners. NLV-III will be managed by this team of 6 senior partners, 5 of whom\nhave worked together continuously for a decade or more. These partners bring a strong\ncombination of significant and relevant industry operating experience and successful venture\ncapital investment experience to NLV-III.\nThe Managing Directors of NLV-III are Philippe Chambon MD PhD, Jeani Delagardelle, Ron\nHunt, Vijay Lathi, and Liam Ratcliffe MD PhD. Philippe, Jeani, Ron, and Vijay have worked\ntogether for 15 years over six prior funds at New Leaf and the Sprout Group. Liam joined the\n1 Sprout Group is a venture capital affiliate of Credit Suisse\n2 Please refer to Section III: “Summary of Historical Investment Performance” and Section XIII: “Appendices” including endnote C\nin Appendix 4 regarding information provided by Cambridge Associates.\n3 S&P500, S&P Healthcare, NASDAQ Composite, and Russell 3000.

In this role, Jim will work full-time with\nNLV during the NLV-III investment period in building and managing the NLV-III portfolio,\nand he will continue with full oversight and portfolio management responsibilities for NLV-I\nand NLV-II. With 80+ years of venture investing experience and decades of operating\nexperience in the industries in which they invest, this 6 member senior team (the “Fund\nManagers”) brings highly relevant and complementary experience to bear on this Fund. This\nteam of partners is further strengthened by a group of additional investment professionals who\nadd highly relevant scientific and life sciences investment experience and have made significant\ncontributions to the NLV-II portfolio.\nThe New Leaf team is distinctive in that its members have played a leadership role in the\nhealthcare venture capital industry over the last two decades. During this time, the Fund\nManagers have demonstrated the ability to source high quality investments at all stages,\nincluding start-ups, follow-on private investments, company restructurings, and structured\npublic investments. The Fund Managers source deals through a range of activities that rely on\ntheir deep relationships in academia, industry, and the investment community (private and\npublic), resulting in differentiated and, in many cases, proprietary deal flow. Once initial\ninvestments are made, the Fund Managers are focused on building value in technology based\nhealthcare companies by creating strong management teams and then collaborating with them\nto develop, manage, and execute capital efficient business plans. Through these efforts, the\nFund Managers have earned a reputation as value-added investors and have created some of\nthe best performing portfolios of healthcare technology investments in the industry.\nLONG TERM TRACK RECORD\nOver an 18 year period and across the portfolios of 6 distinct venture funds focused on\nhealthcare technology investments, the Fund Managers have delivered net performance that\nhas consistently outperformed venture industry benchmarks and relevant public equity market\nindices 5,6 . The Fund Managers’ track record is notable for the following reasons:\n�\nPerformance has been consistently top-quartile since the mid-1990s:\nNLV-I, NLV-II and the healthcare technology portfolios in the Sprout Capital funds\nhave invested over $1.6 billion in healthcare technology companies since 1995. Over\nnearly two decades, returns have consistently exceeded Cambridge Associates’ top-\n5 Except as otherwise expressly noted, all performance information contained herein, including rates of return, is as of March 31,\n2014 and is unaudited.

In the U.S., the\nfederal government laid the foundation for these changes with two key pieces of\nlegislation: the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) and the Health\nInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), which are\ndesigned to reduce costs, improve quality, and significantly expand the percentage of\nthe population with access to healthcare services. Importantly, a component of the\nlegislation sets aside funding in the form of direct incentives to healthcare providers to\nbe used to purchase technologies needed to meet the legislation’s requirements. As part\nof healthcare reform, government and private payers will need to migrate their\ntraditional fee-for-service reimbursement models towards more value-centered\napproaches that reward outcomes, efficiency, and reduction in waste. Payers are\napproaching this goal by slashing costs in areas where viable lower cost solutions are\navailable, while at the same time investing much more in the adoption of innovative\nnew products and solutions which can improve outcomes and deliver quantifiable\nvalue, even when considering their additional costs and premium pricing. During this\nperiod of substantial change in the healthcare system, the Fund Managers expect to see\nan unusually large number of opportunities to fund companies developing innovative\nand impactful new therapeutic products as well as tools and applications that enable the\nimplementation and realization of healthcare reform’s goals and objectives.\nRapid Acceleration in Innovation: The Fund Managers believe an unprecedented\nperiod of medical innovation is emerging as decades of research into molecular\nmechanisms of disease is being translated into a steady stream of safer and more\neffective medicines and the biomarkers to guide their use. Importantly, these products\nare providing enormous improvements in both life expectancy and quality of life for\npatients with many serious, life-threatening diseases. Although they will come with\npremium pricing, these products can decrease the overall costs to the healthcare system\nby reducing reliance on equally costly, but less effective and more toxic treatments, by\n9 CMS, OECD, Eurostat\n4\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nreducing clinic visits and hospital admissions and by controlling or curing disease so\nthat the patient can return to a fully productive life. At the same time as this revolution\nin the biological sciences is unfolding, exponential increases in the ability to manage,\nprocess, and store information at low cost are coming out of the information technology\n(IT) industry. This rapid technological progress in IT is allowing the creation of entirely\nnew systems and applications that will fundamentally improve how healthcare systems\nmonitor and manage patients across the full range of care settings. The Fund Managers\nbelieve the massive expansion and integration of capabilities occurring in biology and\ninformation technology is enabling a period of innovation in healthcare that sets a\nuniquely positive environment for the investment of NLV-III.\n�\n�\nMore Favorable Regulatory Environment For New Drug Approvals: Increasing\nnumbers of FDA drug approvals and recently passed U.S. regulatory legislation are\nreflective of a more favorable regulatory environment. The number of new drug\napprovals by FDA in both 2012 (39 NDAs) and 2013 (27 NDAs) trended meaningfully\nhigher compared to the previous 6 years and versus historic averages 10 . In addition, the\nFood and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) was signed into law on\nJuly 9, 2012, providing for additional tools to enable the FDA to promote innovation by\nstreamlining parts of the approval process and improving communication and\nadministrative processes between the agency and pharmaceutical and biotech\ncompanies. Chief among these new tools is the “Breakthrough Therapy” designation.\nThis new designation helps the FDA assist drug developers to expedite the development\nand review of new drugs with preliminary clinical evidence that indicates the drug may\noffer a substantial improvement over available therapies for patients with serious or lifethreatening\ndiseases. Overall, these initiatives and others, both in the U.S. and abroad\n(e.g., E.U. and Japan), have made the regulatory environment more favorable for\ninvestors in the biopharmaceutical sector, and have reduced some of the uncertainty and\nrisk in a critical aspect of drug development.\nCapital Markets And Industry Dynamics Are Favorable For New Investments & Exits:\nSince the most recent peak in fundraising in 2008, it has been estimated that the life\nsciences venture capital fundraising has contracted by 68%, from $7.8 billion in 2008 to\n$2.5 billion in 2012 11 . The Fund Managers believe that there has been a corresponding\ndecline in the number of active venture capital firms investing into life sciences\ncompanies (especially earlier stage), resulting in fewer investors competing for new\ndeals. At the same time, large and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies have\nbecome increasingly dependent on development stage companies as the source of\ninnovation and new products to supplement R&D pipelines and stimulate future\ngrowth. Most of these big companies are committing a large and growing portion of\ntheir R&D budgets to external facing search and evaluation efforts that have the goal of\nobtaining assets through high value mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships, which\ndisproportionally benefit smaller, venture-backed, development stage companies. In\nthe years ahead, we believe that this trend is likely to continue, and possibly accelerate,\ndriven by expected patent expirations on commercial products and continued low\nproductivity of pharma R&D. The Fund Managers believe these dynamics offer venture\n10 Food and Drug Administration. Center For Drug Evaluation and Research\n11 Dow Jones; Fenwick & West Analysis in 2012 Trends in Terms of Life Science Venture Financings\n5\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nand growth stage investors attractive conditions for both new investments and exits\nfrom existing investments for the foreseeable future.\nThe Fund Managers view this alignment of critical market factors as unprecedented. Each of\nthese factors individually has a direct impact on the level of risk and the potential for returns in\nthe healthcare technology sector. However, the positive trends in all of them occurring at the\nsame time should create a uniquely positive environment to execute NLV-III’s targeted strategy\nwithin the sector.\nINVESTMENT STRATEGY\nNew Leaf’s investment strategy is differentiated in the venture capital industry in terms of its\nsector focus, specific approaches within each sector, and the depth of experience and long-term\ntrack record that supports each element of the strategy. The Fund’s primary focus will be on\ninvestments in the Biopharmaceutical and Information Convergence sectors, with a secondary\nfocus on Medical Devices and Biological Research Tools & Infrastructure. Investments will\nbe predominantly in the U.S., but could include a small number of investments in other parts of\nthe world (e.g., Western Europe or Canada). The focus within each sector will be the following:\nBiopharmaceuticals: As in NLV-I and NLV-II, biopharmaceutical investments will be the core\nfocus for NLV-III and will comprise approximately 50% - 60% of the Fund. The Fund will\ntypically invest in development stage and commercial stage private companies and in publicly\ntraded small capitalization companies where the investments will be made mostly through\nstructured transactions. The portfolio will emphasize companies developing targeted\ntherapeutics that address molecular mechanisms of disease, where validated biomarkers can be\nutilized to positively bias probabilities of success and reduce time and cost of development\ncompared to historical averages. These companies exemplify some of the key characteristics the\nFund Managers seek across the portfolio - namely large, unmet medical needs, strong science,\nwell differentiated technologies and high quality pre-clinical and clinical development\nprograms led by experienced management teams.\nThe Fund Managers believe that NLV-III will have the opportunity to invest in compelling\nbiopharmaceutical opportunities and that these will have attractive risk-return profiles for a\nnumber of reasons, including the following:\n�\n�\nFor the past decade, biopharmaceutical companies have been shifting their research and\ndevelopment focus towards products that target mechanisms of disease at the molecular\nlevel. Clinical programs for these types of products are typically smaller, more capital\nefficient and have higher probabilities of success. These improvements are achievable\nbecause precise biomarker testing enables a focus on only those patients where the\nspecific molecular mechanism is known to play an important role in the disease process.\nBy including only these patients in the clinical programs for these targeted products, the\nprobability of detecting critical efficacy signals is significantly increased, even with\nrelatively small numbers of patients;\nTargeted development programs are benefiting from an improving regulatory\nenvironment, as the FDA is demonstrating clear interest in working constructively with\ncompanies to bring these types of high-impact therapeutics to market more quickly and\nefficiently. This spirit of cooperation was covered thoughtfully in a recent New England\n6\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nJournal of Medicine editorial (November 2013), where Janet Woodcock, MD, the FDA’s\nDirector of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and other senior FDA staff\nmembers as co-authors, discussed the FDA’s new breakthrough therapy designation\nthat can be granted to expedite the review and approval of new therapies to treat people\nwith serious or life threatening illnesses where inadequate treatment options exist. They\nstate that “The genesis of the new designation can be traced to several emerging trends\nin drug discovery and development. Most notable is the rise of molecularly targeted\ntherapies, often paired with companion diagnostics”. The editorial goes on to say that\n“Once a drug is designated as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA commits to working\nparticularly closely with the drug sponsor to devise the most efficient pathway for\ngenerating additional evidence needed about safety and efficacy”. The breakthrough\ntherapy designation was created under FDASIA in 2012, and since that time 26\nbreakthrough therapy designations have been granted on 80 requests; 12\n�\n�\nThe pharmaceutical industry’s commercial model is also improving with the shift in\nfocus to targeted therapeutics, as these therapies can: (a) provide significant\nimprovements in efficacy and safety over current standards of care; (b) offer important\nclinical benefits in terms of increased life expectancy and improved quality of life; (c)\npositively impact high morbidity diseases, many of which have primarily expensive, but\ninadequate treatments available (e.g., cancer and autoimmune diseases); and (d)\ngenerate compelling economic benefits to payers, even when they carry premium\npricing;\nFinally, large and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies have recognized the\ninefficiency of their internal R&D efforts and have deemphasized many of their own\nexpensive, high risk, “blockbuster” programs. Increasingly, these companies are\n“externalizing” a large portion of their R&D activity by acquiring, licensing, or\npartnering with smaller biotech companies that are focused on developing the novel\ntargeted therapeutics mentioned above.\nThe Fund Managers believe the net result for investors is an improving risk-return equation for\nbiopharmaceutical investments, which should translate into higher returns in the sector.\nInformation Convergence: Information convergence investments will be the second core focus\nfor NLV-III, expected to comprise up to 25% of the Fund. Building on the leadership\nestablished during the NLV-II investment period along with significant experience from past\nSprout funds, the Fund Managers will invest NLV-III in companies seeking to improve\nefficiency and reduce overall costs to the healthcare system through the generation, analysis,\nand application of information from research to diagnosis and delivery of care. Investments in\nthis sector will be at the commercial stage at the time of initial investment, or will be expected to\nreach the commercial stage during the projected timeline of the investment.\nCentral to this opportunity is the acute structural deficit in the U.S., with healthcare liabilities\nthe single largest contributor and the healthcare reform initiatives that were designed in part to\naddress these critical fiscal issues. Broad scale deployment of new information technology will\n12 New England Journal of Medicine, November 14, 2013: Expediting Drug Development – The FDA’s New “Breakthrough\nTherapy” Designation\n7\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nplay a critical role in enabling the necessary structural changes to the healthcare system. The\nHITECH Act created a $25.9 billion 13 Federal Government funded catalyst for the adoption of\ninformation technology in healthcare in the U.S., and this is stimulating significant investment\nin upgrading the information infrastructure at the provider level. This industry-wide\ntechnology upgrade moves the vast majority of providers onto electronic systems, which offers\nimmediate efficiencies to their businesses and lays the foundation for the adoption of new\ntargeted information based applications in the future. These investments and legislative actions\nby the U.S. government, and the subsequent response by insurers, providers and patients, are\ndriving a dramatic increase in spending on healthcare information technology (HIT), benefitting\nthe companies providing technology solutions that reduce cost and waste, drive efficiency, and\nimprove the quality of patient care.\nThe opportunity in information convergence also benefits significantly from the technologies\nand infrastructure that have been developed and implemented outside of healthcare, such as\ncloud computing, wireless communications, web-delivered software-as-a-service, and sensor\ntechnology. Small companies drawing heavily off these existing technologies are able to\noptimize their product through rapid iterations driven by user feedback, thereby reducing risk\nand capital requirements, and leading to more predictable timelines, similar to what has been\nseen in the broader information technology arena. The Fund Managers believe that smaller,\nfocused companies will play a key role in developing and deploying information based\nproducts that address discrete problems within the U.S. healthcare market, and that a large\nnumber of these will be compelling investment opportunities for NLV-III.\nMedical Devices: Given the Fund Managers’ view that the operating and exit environment for\ncompanies in this sector will be more challenging due to increased regulatory and\nreimbursement uncertainty, NLV-III will have somewhat less exposure to this sector than\nprevious funds. The Fund will focus on investments in companies that are developing\ninnovative and differentiated medical devices, targeting large market opportunities that offer\nthe potential to meaningfully reduce overall patient treatment costs in high morbidity disease\nsettings through substantial efficacy and safety benefits versus existing standards of care.\nImportantly, the focus will be on opportunities that have established regulatory approval\npathways and clear regulatory precedents, or are already at the commercial stage at the time of\ninitial investment. The objective will be to identify investment opportunities with later stage\nrisk profiles that can be expected to thrive in the current environment. Although the number of\ndeals in this sector is likely to be somewhat lower than in previous funds, with the later stage\nfocus, it is likely that the size of investments in this sector will be larger.\nBiological Research Tools & Infrastructure: The rapid growth of this sector is being fuelled by\nmany of the same biomedical advances that are impacting health care more broadly, such as\npersonalized medicine and DNA sequencing. Smaller companies have always been a prolific\nsource of innovative new research tools, leading to high M&A interest among the large\ncommercial players in this sector. Moreover, because new reagents and research tools are not\nsubject to the risks of clinical trials, regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement it is possible\nto build high-gross margins businesses that reach break-even on manageable timelines and\nbudgets. The Fund will approach this sector opportunistically and will seek to invest in a small\n13 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The established and proven sourcing activities rely on diverse networks\nof deal sources that have been built and cultivated over two decades and focus on identifying\ncompelling healthcare technology investment opportunities, at attractive time points for\ninvestment. These efforts balance the inherent attractiveness of an innovative technology with\nthe selection of the appropriate investment stage, offering an optimal risk-adjusted return\npotential and multiple paths to realization and liquidity.\nThe Fund Managers have refined and successfully executed this investment process over many\nyears, and it is an integral part of the firm’s culture. New Leaf’s investment philosophy and\nprocess emphasize a team approach to maximizing investment returns, focusing the most\nappropriate resources within the firm to deal sourcing, rigorous investment analysis, deep\ninvolvement with portfolio companies and active management of financings and exits.\nDISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF NEW LEAF\nOver the last two decades, New Leaf has established itself as one of the premier brands in\nhealthcare technology investing as a result of a powerful combination of:\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\none of the most established and stable teams in the venture capital industry with deep\nand complementary operating and investing experience;\na long term track record across portfolios of healthcare technology investments in six\ndistinct venture funds and over $1.6 billion in total invested capital that has\ndemonstrated consistent outperformance versus venture industry peers and relevant\npublic market indices (S&P 500, S&P Healthcare, NASDAQ Composite, and Russell\n3000) 14 ;\nan evolving investment strategy, focused on a diversified portfolio of investments across\nsectors, stages (start-ups to growth equity), and therapeutic areas that has proven to\ngenerate returns through both up and down phases of macro investment cycles;\na hands-on approach to working with management teams as board members to\noptimize corporate strategy, develop and refine clinical, regulatory, and operating plans,\nrecruit world-class talent, and drive business development activities that lead to valuemaximizing\nfollow-on financings, partnerships, and M&A transactions; and\na reputation for intellectual rigor, hard work, value added contributions, and\nconstructive collaboration that makes New Leaf a sought after lead investor by\noutstanding entrepreneurs and a preferred co-investor amongst a broad range of top\nquality investors.\n14 Please refer to Section III: “Summary of Historical Investment Performance” and Section XIII: “Appendices” including endnotes\nB, C, F and G in Appendix 4.\n9\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nNLV-III Investment Opportunity\nThe objective of NLV-III is to invest in a portfolio of healthcare technology companies that offer\nattractive risk-adjusted returns. The companies that comprise the portfolio will be selected and\nmanaged by a team of highly experienced senior partners who have developed and proven\ntheir investment process over many years and multiple funds. The investment strategy for\nNLV-III is similar to the strategies pursued in prior funds, in that it will have a core focus on\nbiopharmaceutical investments with a balance of investments across other healthcare\ntechnology sectors. Given the strength and stability of the team, the consistency and the depth\nof the track record, and the positive market forces and investment conditions that are expected\nto be in place during the life of the Fund, the Fund Managers believe NLV-III offers investors an\nopportunity for attractive returns.\n10\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nII. THE TEAM\nNLV-III will be managed by the New Leaf team, which currently manages NLV-I, NLV-II, and\nprovides sub-advisory services managing the remaining healthcare technology investments in\nthe Sprout Funds. The team of six senior partners, five of whom have worked together\ncontinuously for over a decade, stands out in the industry for its depth of accomplishments,\ntrack record of consistent investment success, and its organizational stability. Each of the senior\npartners has a strong combination of significant and relevant industry operating experience and\nventure capital investment experience from one or more of the Fund’s targeted sectors. The\nNew Leaf team is further strengthened by a group of experienced investment professionals who\nadd highly relevant scientific backgrounds and investment experience.\nThe following timeline shows the history and progression of the New Leaf team:\nHistory and Progression of New Leaf Team\nSENIOR TEAM\nPhilippe Chambon, MD, Ph.D., (55), Managing Director, helped found New Leaf in 2005.\nPhilippe joined Sprout in 1995 and since that time has been an active investor in all three sectors\nof interest for NLV-III.

SUMMARY OF HISTORICAL INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE\nThe Fund Managers’ long term track record in healthcare technology investing clearly\nestablishes the team as one of the most successful in the venture capital industry over the last\ntwo decades. Over an 18 year period and across the portfolios of six distinct venture funds\nfocused on healthcare technology investments, the Fund Managers have delivered net\nperformance that has consistently outperformed venture industry benchmarks and relevant\npublic equity market indices 15,16 . The Fund Managers’ track record is notable for the following\nreasons:\n� Performance has been consistently top-quartile since the mid-1990s:\nNLV-I, NLV-II and the healthcare technology portfolios in the Sprout Capital funds\nhave invested over $1.6 billion in healthcare technology companies since 1995. Over this\ntime, The Fund Managers’ returns have consistently exceeded Cambridge Associates’\ntop-quartile benchmarks for U.S. venture capital healthcare and/or U.S. total venture\ncapital. 16\n�\nExceeded relevant public equity indices by substantial margins on all realized funds:\nThe Fund Managers invested $1.02 billion in the portfolios of healthcare technology\ninvestments in four Sprout Capital funds (Sprout Capital IX, L.P., Sprout Capital VIII,\nL.P., Sprout Capital VII, L.P. and Sprout Growth II, L.P.), and these are now fully\nrealized (or near fully realized in the case of Sprout Capital IX). The net annual IRR’s on\nthese four funds outperformed the S&P 500 (568 – 2,259 bps), S&P Healthcare (302 –\n2,066 bps), NASDAQ Composite (451 – 2,125 bps), and the Russell 3000 (502 – 2,215 bps)\nusing the Public Market Equivalent Plus (PME+) methodology 17 . Although PME+\nmethodology is most informative when used to analyze funds whose returns are\nmature, the PME+ methodology shows that NLV-I is outperforming these same indices,\nand shows encouraging results for NLV-II despite its relative immaturity.\nIt is this consistently high level of return over an 18 year period, spanning several challenging\ninvestment cycles, that creates a truly unique track record within the venture capital sector.\nINVESTMENT PERFORMANCE WITHIN INDIVIDUAL FUNDS\nThe New Leaf team has invested over $1.67 billion in 126 healthcare technology companies\nwithin 6 distinct funds since 1995. These funds included NLV-I and NLV-II and the healthcare\ntechnology investments in four Sprout Capital funds (Sprout Capital IX, L.P., Sprout Capital\nVIII, L.P., Sprout Capital VII, L.P., and Sprout Growth II, L.P., together the “Sprout Funds”). In\naggregate, the team has exited or partially exited investments in 92 companies, generating gross\nrealizations of over $2.6 billion and a gross realized cash-on-cash return and internal rate of\nreturn (IRR) of 2.1x and 17%, respectively. Corresponding net returns on the portfolios in each\nof these funds are provided in Appendix 2.\n15 Please see Section XIII: “Appendices” and the endnotes in Appendix 4.

The fund completed its new investment period in early 2008 with a portfolio of 22\ncompanies. NLV-I has fully realized 13 investments, and there are nine active investments in\ncompanies and contingent value rights (CVRs) from three of the realized investments remaining\nin the fund. NLV-I is a relatively young fund, with the majority of the cost basis still at work,\nand to date has generated a gross realized IRR of 23%, and a gross total IRR of 19%. NLV-I has\na net total multiple of 1.76x and a net IRR of 12.1%. NLV-I has a distributed to paid-in-capital\nratio of 0.51x, and the Fund Managers believe the fund has significant future returns potential\nfrom the remaining active investments in the portfolio as well as from potential payments from\nCVRs on three realized investments. NLV-I is in the top quartile of funds tracked by\nCambridge Associates for U.S. healthcare venture capital in the 2005 vintage year.\nNLV-II has capital commitments of $450 million, and the Fund Managers began investing in\n2008. The fund will complete its new investment period by mid-2014. NLV-II currently has a\nportfolio consisting of 35 companies. NLV-II has realized or partially realized 13 investments,\nand there are 22 other active investments and a small public portfolio remaining in the fund.\nNLV-II is still an immature fund in terms of level of realizations, and to date has generated a\ngross realized IRR of 34%, and a gross total IRR of 30%. NLV-II has a net total multiple of 1.44x\nand a net IRR of 16.4%. NLV-II has a distributed to paid-in-capital ratio of 0.50x, and the Fund\nManagers believe the fund has significant future returns potential from the remaining active\ninvestments in the portfolio. The Fund Managers believe that NLV-II has unusually positive\nliquidity characteristics for a life sciences focused venture capital fund of its age, with just over\n65% of the fund’s current carrying value in the form of public securities (as of March 31, 2014).\nNLV-II’s current performance places the fund in the top quartile of funds tracked by Cambridge\nAssociates for U.S. venture capital in the 2008 vintage year.\nAdditionally, over the investment period of NLV-I, the net annual IRR is outperforming\nrelevant public market indices when compared on a public market equivalent basis (PME+).\nNLV-II’s net annual IRR shows encouraging results thus far for a relatively immature fund 18 .\nThe range of outperformance for each of these portfolios versus the S&P 500, S&P Healthcare,\nNASDAQ Composite, and the Russell 3000 through March 31, 2014 is the following:\nNet IRR Outperformance vs. Public Indices (PME+ Methodology)\nS&P\n500\nS&P\nHealthcare\nNASDAQ\nComposite\nRussell\n3000\nNew Leaf Ventures I, L.P. +496 bps +201 bps +181 bps +446 bps\nNew Leaf Ventures II, L.P. +275 bps -187 bps -21 bps +218 bps\n18 Please refer to Section III: “Summary of Historical Investment Performance” and Section XIII: “Appendices; Appendix 3” and the\nendnotes thereto (regarding the PME+ methodology).\n19\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nSprout Capital Healthcare Technology Portfolios:\nSince 1995, members of the New Leaf team made all of the healthcare technology investments in\nthe Sprout Funds while they were part of the investing team at the Sprout Group. The Sprout\nFunds were venture capital funds that were diversified across several sectors including\ninformation technology, communications, services, and healthcare technology. The healthcare\ntechnology investments in the four Sprout Funds included $1.019 billion in total cost, which\nwas invested in new and follow-on investments in 69 companies from 1995 to 2013. The\nhealthcare technology investments in the first three of these funds are now fully realized, and\nthose in Sprout IX are nearly fully realized. To date, across these four funds, the New Leaf team\nhas generated $1.997 billion of realizations in the aggregate (63 realized investments), and there\nis $68 million in unrealized value in six unrealized investments.\nThe net annual IRR performance on the healthcare technology portfolios in each of the Sprout\nFunds would place them in the top quartile of all healthcare venture capital funds tracked by\nCambridge Associates in each of the vintage years for which they have established a\nbenchmark 19 . Additionally, over an 18 year period the net annual IRR on these portfolios\noutperformed relevant public market indices when compared on a public market equivalent\nbasis (PME+) 20 .

OPPORTUNITY IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR\nThe Fund Managers believe a number of macro market factors have aligned to create attractive\nand lasting conditions for NLV-III’s targeted investment strategy in healthcare technology.\nEach of these market factors individually would have a direct positive impact on the level of\nrisk and the potential for returns from investments in the healthcare technology sector. The fact\nthat there are positive trends in all of them occurring simultaneously is unprecedented, and the\nFund Managers expect that this will create a uniquely positive environment for NLV-III’s\ninvestments in the healthcare technology sector. These macro market factors include the\nfollowing:\nSTRONG GROWTH IN GLOBAL HEALTHCARE MARKETS\nHealthcare is one of the largest and most dynamic segments of the global economy, and its\ngrowth is projected to continue the well-established historical trend of outpacing GDP growth\nin major economies for at least the next decade. 21 In the U.S., since 1970, health care spending\nper capita has grown at an average annual rate of 8.2% or 2.4 percentage points faster than\nnominal GDP. The persistence of this trend suggests systematic differences between health care\nand other economic sectors where growth rates are typically more in line with the overall\neconomy. A smaller difference is projected over the 2011 to 2020 period, where the average\nannual growth in per capita health spending (5.3%) is projected to be about 140 basis points\nhigher than the growth in GDP (3.9%) 22 . This powerful and sustained growth differentiates\nhealthcare from many other large industrial and technology sectors, and it creates a positive\nbackdrop for investment in certain areas within the sector.\nThe drivers of healthcare market growth vary between mature and emerging economies, but in\nboth cases the shifts are resulting in significant increases in per capita health care consumption\nand predictable increases in spending to meet the rising demand. In developed economies,\ngrowth is being driven primarily by an aging population coupled with a continued willingness\nof payers to cover the costs for new therapeutics and interventions that meaningfully extend or\nimprove the quality of patients’ lives. In the U.S., which is representative of the demographic\nshifts in other major economies, the number of people over 65 is expected to double over the\nnext three decades, reaching 70 million by 2030 or roughly 20% of the total U.S. population. 23\nThis aging demographic has a higher prevalence of disease and the cost of delivering care to\ntreat the diseases of this older demographic is rising steadily. For example, in 2009, the per\ncapita health care cost for a person 65 – 74 years old was approximately $14,000, but it was more\nthan double that ($33,000) for those over 85. Before the end of this decade, the projected per\ncapita annual cost to care for these same two groups is expected to rise to $22,000 (+57%) for 65\n– 74 year olds and $55,000 (+67%) for those 85+ 24 .\nEmerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICs) are also contributing to the\ngrowth in health care spending globally, as these emerging markets mature and begin moving\ntowards the standards of their counterparts in developed economies. The size of the middle\n21 CMS, OECD, Eurostat\n22 Historical data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Office of the Actuary, National Health Statistics Group\n23 U.S. Census Bureau\n24 Alvarez & Marsal healthcare, getting much closer to the cost precipice\n24\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nand upper classes in these countries is growing rapidly, and the spending power of these\ngroups is becoming important to the global economy in many sectors. As the populations of\nthese countries become more affluent, a greater proportion of their GDP is being spent on health\ncare, and this is leading to rapid growth in many different healthcare product sectors in these\ncountries. For example, China’s prescription drug market, which is projected to be the world’s\nsecond largest by 2020, is projected to grow to more than $110 billion by 2015 – up from $50\nbillion in 2010. 25 The medical device market in China is showing a similar growth pattern, with\nthe current $17 billion medtech market (world’s fourth largest) projected to more than double\nwithin the next five years. 26 This growth in emerging economies is expected to continue for the\nforeseeable future, and as it does, it will open vast new markets for established healthcare\nproducts companies in more developed countries, and will become increasingly important as a\npercentage of sales of global brands. At the same time, it will create opportunities for smaller,\nU.S. based companies to partner with large multinationals and domestic companies in the\nBRICs that have established distribution channels in these markets.\nSIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY CREATED BY HEALTHCARE REFORM &\nRESTRUCTURING\nAs a result of the strong growth in healthcare expenditures, for at least the next decade, and\nlikely much longer, the healthcare industry in the U.S. will be going through a period of\nsignificant reform and restructuring as the increasing healthcare costs place unsustainable fiscal\nburdens on government programs. After years of dire predictions and endless debate amongst\nelected officials, pundits, corporate leaders, and patient advocacy groups, there is recognition\nthat long term healthcare liabilities are a critical issue and require broad reform to control their\ngrowth before they lead to irreparable fiscal harm. While much of the attention in these\ninitiatives is focused on identifying opportunities to cut costs, the silver lining in them for\ninvestors is that their objectives also seek to improve the quality of healthcare and to\nsubstantially broaden the population that has access to healthcare services covered by third\nparty payment.\nIn the U.S., the Federal Government has laid the foundations for restructuring the healthcare\nsystem through two key pieces of legislation. First, the HITECH Act provides large government\nsubsidies for the adoption of IT tools by healthcare providers. The Federal Government has\nrecognized that a fundamental underpinning of healthcare reform is a massive upgrade of the\ninformation technology infrastructure at all levels of the industry, and through this legislation\nhas earmarked $26 billion dollars in direct subsidies to catalyze investment in this area.\nThe second key piece of legislation is the ACA, which is being implemented as a first step in the\noverhaul of the U.S. healthcare system. The ACA was signed into law in the U.S. in 2010 and\nbegins its implementation phase in 2014. It is a complex piece of legislation that is designed to\nreform and overhaul many aspects of the U.S. healthcare system. The goals of the ACA are to\nincrease the affordability and rate of health insurance coverage for all Americans, and to control\nthe runaway growth in costs of health care faced by government, employers, and individuals.\nThe ACA mandates a number of broad reaching mechanisms to achieve these goals, and\n25 Reuters\n26 InVivo (Elseveir), June 2013\n25\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nintroduces a range of new incentives/penalties that force market participants to address major\ncost, efficiency, and quality issues within the healthcare system.\nThe ACA and other healthcare reform initiatives are challenged by dual and somewhat\nconflicting objectives. They are focused on reducing costs and slowing growth rates in\nspending, but at the same time expand the size of the population that has access to healthcare\ncovered by third party payment mechanisms. In order to cover the increased costs of the\nexpanded coverage, reform initiatives attempt to radically improve the efficiency of healthcare\ndelivery as a way of freeing up resources that can be redirected to providing care to populations\nthat had previously not been covered. Some of the lowest hanging fruit that is being targeted in\nearly reform initiatives is eliminating waste from the healthcare system. There are enormous\nresources that can be freed up by eliminating expenditures that are unnecessary or duplicative.\nIn the U.S. healthcare system alone, there is an estimated $765 billion that is wasted annually.\nMore than half of that total ($415 billion) is the result of fraud, unnecessary services, and\ninefficiently or mistakenly delivered care. Another 25%+ of the total ($190 billion) is the result\nof excess administrative costs (e.g., inefficiencies associated with paperwork and\ndocumentation) 27 . Finding ways to reduce waste in the system offers the opportunity to create\nsignificant value, but requires the adoption of entirely new tools and technologies by payers,\nproviders, and patients. Developing these tools, applications, and systems is an area of\nsignificant opportunity for innovative technology focused companies.\nA major part of eliminating waste in healthcare will be accomplished by driving efficiency and\nderiving maximum benefit from the enormous levels of current expenditures. Achieving this\ngoal will have to include a fundamental change in focus to the principles of value-based\nmedicine across all levels of the healthcare system. This is a radical change in objectives that is\nalready happening, and it is leading to entirely new reimbursement models built around paying\nfor technologies and treatments that provide care efficiently and at a cost proportional to the\nhealth benefit they deliver. Value-based medicine focuses on outcomes from healthcare\nservices, which more closely aligns the interests of the payers with the healthcare providers and\nproduct companies whose services and products are the major cost elements in the delivery of\nhealthcare. Although simple conceptually, this is a fundamental change in how healthcare is\npaid for from the historical reimbursement models that have focused on fixed payments for\ndelivery of discrete procedures, with no corresponding emphasis on quality of the care\ndelivered or on the resulting patient outcomes.\nRefocusing treatment objectives within the healthcare system towards high quality outcomes\nover numbers of procedures will require many healthcare companies to reengineer aspects of\ntheir business models, but it will also provide them with new opportunity. In a system that\nrewards outcomes, companies and organizations that run with the highest quality and most\nefficiently will have significant opportunity to expand their own returns by taking on risk in the\ntreatment of patients. Opening the market to this dynamic, where there is opportunity to earn a\nreturn on cost-effective, high quality patient management and outcomes, will stimulate the\ndevelopment and adoption of an entirely new set of enabling technologies and business models,\nwhich represent opportunity for innovative, technology-based, development and growth stage\ncompanies.\n27 National Academy of Sciences, “Best Care at Lower Cost: The Path to Continuously Learning Health Care in America”\n26\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nThere is no question that the shift to value-based reimbursement models will have a major\nimpact on the economics of healthcare. Payers will be looking for ways to significantly reduce\ncosts in all areas where a range of viable lower cost solutions are available, and will force\nproviders to use those wherever possible through increasingly restrictive reimbursement\npolicies. As an example, one area where this type of change has been implemented successfully\nfor years is in the increased use of generic drugs, where payers no longer offer unrestricted\nreimbursement for the use of high cost, premium priced branded biopharmaceutical products\nthat deliver only minor benefits in terms of convenience, or slight improvements in efficacy to\nsmall percentages of patients. This type of value-based review is now going on in all areas\nwithin healthcare, and is resulting in changes that are having a major impact on what services\nand products are selected, and who bears what percentage of the cost of that selection.\nAt the same time that payers and other ‘at-risk’ organizations are looking for any and all\nopportunities to move to lower cost alternatives, they are also continuing to invest in the\nadoption of innovative new therapeutics which can both improve outcomes and deliver\nquantifiable value, even when considering their additional costs and premium pricing. The\nproducts that receive this type of support from payers are ones that are focused on addressing\ntruly unmet medical needs and deliver significant efficacy or safety benefits to patients, when\ncompared to existing standards of care. They are also usually based on new technologies that\nenable novel approaches to the treatment of diseases and disorders. There are vast areas in\nmedicine where large unmet medical needs exist and where scientific and technological\nprogress is enabling entirely new approaches to addressing these. Where these intersect are\nareas of great opportunity for experienced investors.\nRAPID ACCELERATION IN INNOVATION IN TARGETED SECTORS\nBiopharmaceuticals:\nDecades of government and industry investment in the study of the biological and genetic basis\nof disease is translating into a steady stream of new products with improved efficacy and\ndecreased toxicity, and these are transforming how many high-morbidity diseases can be\ntreated. Through this growing body of work, a much deeper understanding of the biochemical\npathways underlying complex diseases is emerging, which is leading to identification of many\nnew molecular targets for drug therapy. This targeted approach to pharmaceutical R&D is a\nfundamental change from the historical process that relied on large-scale, random screening of\ndrug candidates for activity. A whole new generation of products targeting diseases at the\nmolecular level is emerging and these offer much higher levels of efficacy and improved safety\nto specific groups of patients whose disease is well characterized by biomarkers that are tightly\nlinked to the mechanisms of the underlying disease. This more targeted approach to discovery\nand development offers important benefits to all constituents, which ultimately improves the\ninvestment environment in biopharmaceuticals.\nOncology (i.e., cancer) is one therapeutic area where some of the most significant progress has\nbeen made recently. Targeted therapies in certain indications in oncology now provide for\nmore effective treatments with fewer side effects than one-size-fits-all chemotherapy drugs. For\nexample, new therapies have recently been developed that target specific subsets of malignancy\nthrough molecular targets including EGFR, HER2, and BRAF that have led to dramatic\nimprovement in the treatment of certain cancers (e.g., lung, pancreatic, colon, breast, melanoma,\nand several hematologic cancers). It is expected that the next wave of advances will transform\n27\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nthese diseases further from what has historically been a death sentence into a chronic, treatable\ncondition. As this happens, huge markets will be created for entirely new biopharmaceutical\nproducts. While cancer is the leading disease area, this pace of dramatic scientific and\ntechnological progress is extending into several other areas of medicine and will likely\naccelerate. Many of the initial examples of targeted or personalized therapies in non-cancer\nindications have been in rare or so called \"orphan\" diseases following discovery of the\nunderlying genetic abnormalities. This period of rapid technology advancement establishes a\ncycle of innovation in the market that creates great opportunity for highly focused, small,\ncompanies.\nInformation Convergence:\nThe rate of innovation in information convergence has already accelerated relative to the\nhistorical rate of innovation in healthcare information technology (“HCIT”) due to several\nunderlying factors. First, as mentioned, the HITECH Act provided billions in direct incentives\nto encourage healthcare providers to adopt information technology, beginning with electronic\nmedical record (“EMR”) systems. This led to a significant increase in spending on EMRs which\nbenefitted large established EMR vendors, but it also benefitted new smaller players in the EMR\nmarket. Importantly, the broad upgrade of information technology and deployment of EMRs\nacross the healthcare provider market has established a technology infrastructure in the market\nthat benefits an entirely new generation of companies that are developing technologies that\nlayer onto existing EMRs and address the next levels of IT adoption. This next level of\ninformation technology adoption is dictated by the HITECH Act through a series of\n“meaningful use” incentive initiatives.\nAnother key factor that has led to an acceleration in innovation in information convergence is\nthat most of the highest value innovation in this sector is arising from integrating technologies\nthat have been discovered, developed, validated, and implemented in completely different\nsectors (e.g., cloud storage, mobile computing, wireless communications, web-delivered\nsoftware, diagnostics and sensors). These product development efforts draw heavily from\nexisting technologies and allow small companies focused on addressing discrete problems and\nopportunities within the healthcare market to develop and launch products with minimal\ntechnology discovery. The bulk of the effort in these activities is in rapidly creating high value\nproducts by combining well-understood and available technologies, and getting them into the\nhands of customers to evaluate their performance in real world use conditions. This early\ncustomer experience allows companies to generate revenues early in their life, but also provides\nvaluable user feedback which can be used to continuously improve product design elements.\nThe benefit of this type of product development effort in the information convergence sector is\nthat it reduces risk, lowers capital requirements, and results in more predictable timelines.\nConsidering the size of the opportunity and the large number of discrete problems and\ninefficiencies that must be addressed, the Fund Managers expect the next decade will be a\nperiod of robust innovation and company creation. Smaller companies are likely to thrive\nduring this period as they are better able to quickly move from opportunity to product launch.\n28\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nCONTRACTION IN HEALTHCARE VENTURE CAPITAL INDUSTRY & CAPITAL MARKET\nDYNAMICS MORE BROADLY CREATE OPPORTUNITY IN DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND\nEARLY COMMERCIAL STAGE COMPANIES\nFor the last several decades the healthcare venture capital industry has been the predominant\nsource of early and growth stage funding for smaller, technology focused companies while they\npursue product development, regulatory approval, and early commercialization. Over the last\nseveral years, there has been a significant contraction in the size of the healthcare venture\ncapital industry in terms of amount of capital available to fund new companies, and the number\nof active firms investing in new companies. This contraction creates significant opportunity for\nthose funds that remain active, as fewer firms and less capital is translating into less\ncompetition for deals. The Fund Managers have benefited from the reduced level of\ncompetition during the new investment period for NLV–II, and they believe these conditions\nwill remain in place for at least part of the new investment period of NLV-III. It is too soon to\nknow for sure, but it is likely the industry may have already reached the bottom of this cycle of\ncontraction and could see a re-set that begins to shift the industry to more normalized\nconditions due to the recent stronger IPO and M&A markets.\nLife Sciences Venture Fundraising\nInvestments into Biopharma and Medical Devices\nLife Sciences Venture Fundraising - Dollars Raised ($B) **\n$10.0\nLife Sciences Venture Financings – $ Invested ($B) and Count\n$15.0\n700\n$8.0\n$6.0\n$4.0\n$2.0\n$7.8 $7.8\n$2.8 $2.9 $3.0\n$2.5\n$12.0\n$9.0\n$6.0\n$3.0\n404\n$6.1\n$1.2\n$4.8\n422\n$5.7\n$1.7\n$4.1\n485\n$7.2\n$2.3\n$4.9\n541\n$8.5\n$2.9\n$5.7\n517\n500 499 498\n$6.9\n$6.3\n$6.5\n$5.6\n$2.5\n$2.2\n$1.8\n$2.5\n$4.4 $4.0 $3.8 $4.0\n422\n$5.1\n$2.0\n$3.1\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n$0.0\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\n$0.0\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\n0\nVenture Capital Fundraising Allocated to Life Sciences\nBiopharmaceuticals Therapeutic Medical Devices Deal Count\nSource: Venture investments data from VentureSource (U.S. only).

Although the number\nof IPOs in the healthcare technology sector increased significantly, most of that activity was\ndriven by offerings for biopharmaceuticals companies. The significant increase in IPO activity\nwas driven by a number of factors, but one that had an important impact is the Jumpstart Our\nBusiness Startups Act (JOBS Act). This legislation was signed into law in the U.S. in April, 2012\nand it changed the regulations governing how certain private companies can interact with\ninvestors in advance of an IPO. Under the new regulations, emerging growth companies can\nfile their IPO draft registration statement privately with the SEC, and continue to meet with\ninterested investors over several weeks or months to explain clearly their company strategy and\ntechnology in “testing the waters” meetings. The Fund Managers believe these new regulations\nare especially helpful to private biopharmaceutical companies, as they allow interested\n29\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\ninvestors to grasp the complexities and opportunities of the small biotech companies before the\nformal filing of their IPO registration statements, and the start of the traditional IPO road show.\nThe Fund Managers believe the JOBS Act and the use of “testing the waters meetings” has been\none of the factors that helped open the current biotech IPO window, expanded the base of\ninvestors (public market specialist and generalist investors) participating in the recent offerings,\nand helped drive the after-market performance of many of these offerings.\nBiopharma IPO Trends\n($ in millions)\n$3,000\n$2,852\n40\nCapital Raised ($ in millions)\n$2,500\n$2,000\n$1,500\n$1,000\n$500\n$0\n$2,028\n20\n15\n13\n36\n23\n$1,451\n$1,501\n19\n$754 $778\n$693 8\n0 2\n$153\n11\n$526\n$0\n11\n$769\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Q1\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n# of IPOs\nPre‐Phase 3 Phase 3 Marketed # of IPOs\nThe combination of all of these positive factors has significantly strengthened the position of\nsmaller development and early commercial stage healthcare technology companies, and creates\na unique period of opportunity for investors in the sector.\n30\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nV. NEW LEAF VENTURE PARTNERS INVESTMENT STRATEGY\nNew Leaf’s investment strategy is differentiated in the venture capital industry in terms of its\nsector focus, specific approaches within each sector, and the depth of experience and long-term\ntrack record that supports each element of the strategy. NLV-III will be invested in a diversified\nportfolio across four sectors: a primary focus on Biopharmaceuticals and Information\nConvergence, and a secondary focus on Medical Devices and Biological Research Tools &\nInfrastructure. The Fund Managers believe that these are the sectors within the healthcare\ntechnology industry where, with a targeted and specific sector strategy, there is the potential to\ngenerate attractive returns within a time frame consistent with the goals of investors in a\nventure capital fund. Importantly, the drivers behind the opportunity for value creation, major\nrisk factors, capital requirements, timelines, and universe of potential acquirers in each of these\nsectors are distinct, and thus a portfolio constructed with investments with a combination of\nthese will benefit from this diversification.\nThe Fund Managers will invest the Fund in a diversified portfolio composed of an estimated 24\n– 28 companies that will be predominantly domiciled in the U.S., but could include a small\nnumber of companies based in Western Europe or Canada. The Fund Managers intend to serve\non the boards of directors for the majority of the companies in the portfolio and will generally\nseek to establish ownership positions in companies that are large enough to allow them to exert\nconsiderable influence on the company’s strategies, budgets, financing plans, operating\nobjectives, management team composition, and paths to exit.\nConsistent with past transitions between funds, the Fund Managers have evolved the\ninvestment strategy for NLV-III to reflect the team’s view of where the most attractive\nopportunities will exist during the life of the Fund. The investment strategy for NLV-III will be\ndistinct from other recent funds in terms of the specific weightings that will be placed on the\ntargeted sectors, and certain considerations for company selection within those sectors.\nBIOPHARMACEUTICALS INVESTMENT STRATEGY\nAs in all previous funds, biopharmaceutical investments will be the core focus for NLV-III and\nwill comprise approximately 50% - 60% of the Fund. The Fund’s biopharmaceutical\ninvestments will be mostly in development stage and commercial stage private companies, and\nwill also likely include some investments in small capitalization public companies through\nstructured transactions. The Fund Managers intend to construct a well-diversified portfolio of\nbiopharmaceutical investments that includes a balanced mix of companies with earlier stage\nand later stage development programs and product platform technologies. Regardless of stage,\nby focusing on biopharmaceutical investments ahead of key risk inflection points, the Fund\nManagers expect to fund companies through the periods of greatest value creation to points\nwhere they will either become attractive targets for acquisition or partnership, or become of\nhigh interest to public market investors. In some cases, private companies whose underlying\nassets mature to these stages will become viable candidates for initial public offerings (IPOs) or\nmergers into public companies.\n31\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nFocus: Private and public companies with novel product programs & product platforms\nInvestments in the biopharmaceutical sector within NLV-III will target companies that are\ndeveloping products that address clinically important unmet medical needs with competitively\ndifferentiated technologies. The Fund will invest across all stages, usually in companies that fit\none of two different profiles. The first is companies with clearly differentiated, clinical stage\nproprietary product programs focused on significant market opportunities, where value can be\nbuilt around a product(s) by financing it through one or more stages of clinical development,\nand in some cases to regulatory approval and commercialization. The second are companies\nwith novel product platforms that are at or near the clinical stage with a lead product(s). These\ncompanies build value around both the product(s) itself as it advances through clinical\ndevelopment and around the product platform as its utility as a product creation engine is\nvalidated through the progress of the lead product(s).\nThe Fund Managers expect to identify investment opportunities within private or public\ncompanies whose primary asset(s) fall within one of the following categories:\n�\n�\n�\nEarly and mid-clinical stage product programs targeting a well validated mechanism of\naction in a disease with significant unmet medical need. The therapeutic areas and\nspecific mechanisms of action will be known to be of high strategic interest to a number\nof larger biopharmaceutical companies. The target product profiles of the therapeutic\nproduct(s) for these assets will have clear points of competitive differentiation around\nefficacy and/or safety versus available therapeutics (and known clinical stage\nprograms), and the clinical development programs behind them will be designed to\nprovide clear data in support of these. Examples of these types of biopharmaceutical\ninvestments in the NLV portfolio are Array Biopharma (NLV-II, NASDAQ: ARRY,\noncology, exited at 2.25x), Chimerix (NLV-II, private initially, now public on NASDAQ:\nCMRX, novel anti-viral therapy), and Versartis (NLV-II, private, novel, long-acting\nhuman growth hormone).\nNovel product platforms that offer the potential to target known, and well understood\npharmacologic mechanisms of action in entirely new ways, or a product platform that\nhas the potential to open up a field of entirely new pharmacologic mechanisms in\ndiseases with large unmet medical need and rapidly advancing understanding of the\nunderlying biology (e.g., hematologic and solid tumors). These platforms will be\nsupported by validating data that provide strong support for the underlying biological\nhypotheses, and the companies will be at or approaching the clinical stage with an\nowned or partnered lead product program. The product platforms will usually have\nstrong evidence of strategic interest from large or mid-sized biopharmaceutical\ncompanies through one or more partnerships that have generated non-dilutive capital\nfor the company. Examples of three novel product platform companies in the NLV\nportfolio are Pearl Therapeutics (NLV-I, private, pulmonology, exited at 2.5x plus\nmilestones), Epizyme (NLV-II, NASDAQ: EPZM, oncology, exited at 2.0x), and\nPrincipia (NLV-II, private, immunology & oncology).\nLater development stage and commercial stage, biopharmaceutical investments, where\nthe investment theses will be to create value by funding companies through Phase 3\nclinical trials, regulatory approval, and into early commercialization. In some cases, the\n32\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nFund will seek to fund companies much later into commercialization to the point of\nsustainable profitability. These investments will be into private or small capitalization\npublic companies in situations where the Fund Managers believe that the key risk\ninflection and the period of greatest value creation will be around regulatory approval\nand demonstration of commercial attractiveness of the product. These investments will\nfocus on products where the level of clinical and regulatory risk is relatively low, and\nwhere commercial penetration can be driven by smaller, highly targeted sales and\nmarketing activities. Biopharmaceutical companies at this stage have historically been\nattractive acquisition targets, and have consistently demonstrated that they can access\npublic markets through IPOs in a broad range of market conditions. Examples of this\ntype of later stage investment in the New Leaf portfolio include Acadia Pharmaceuticals\n(NLV-II, NASDAQ: ACAD, exited at 2.5x), Phase III, focused on psychosis associated\nwith neurodegenerative diseases, Durata Therapeutics (NLV-II, private initially, now\npublic on NASDAQ: DRTX), Phase III, focused on a late stage antibiotic development\nprogram spun out of Pfizer, and InterCept Pharmaceuticals (NLV-II, NASDAQ: ICPT,\nexited at 3.2x), Phase III, focused on an orphan indication in liver disease.\n�\nInvestments in public companies at any stage, whose primary assets are product\nprograms or product platforms. Most of these investments will be focused on small\ncapitalization companies at the clinical or early commercialization stage. New Leaf’s\nfocus on investment opportunities in small capitalization public biotech companies\nleverage the broad investment capabilities within the firm and benefit from the focused\nefforts of a small team of investment professionals dedicated exclusively to public\nmarket activities. As a result of this integrated approach, investments in public\ncompanies often target companies the Fund Managers have tracked over a number of\nyears, some from the time when they were private companies. The dedicated public\nmarket team proactively tracks and screens the aggregate universe of biotech\ncompanies, with the goal of identifying compelling risk/reward investment\nopportunities. The primary focus of the screening efforts is to identify high-quality\ncompanies with attractive valuations that require financing to fund the company\nthrough key development milestones. The Fund will generally look to source or\naugment transformative, structured transactions in public companies, where a New Leaf\npartner will have the opportunity to join the board of directors. An example of an\ninvestment that resulted from New Leaf’s focus on public market opportunities includes\nMEI Pharma (NLV-II, NASDAQ: MEIP), an investment the Fund Managers made to\nrecapitalize the company after it had acquired a lead asset, Pracinostat, and needed\ncapital to advance the program through clinical development. Pracinostat was an asset\nthat was well known to New Leaf, as members of the team had followed it closely for\nseveral years while it was owned by a private company (S*Bio), and had made attempts\nto acquire and spin out the asset in the past. In addition to sourcing opportunities, the\npublic market team assists the broader biopharmaceutical investment efforts by\nmanaging the sale and exit of New Leaf’s larger positions in public securities, and by\nproviding real-time insight into evolving market sentiment to the biotechnology and\nbroader healthcare technology sectors that helps guide decisions around new\ninvestments and exit decisions.\nFor a complete list of investments made by the Fund Managers in healthcare technology\ncompanies see Appendices 1 and 4 .\n33\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nLeadership: NLV are leaders in biopharmaceutical investing across all stages and transaction\ntypes\nThe New Leaf team is well positioned to continue to play a leadership role in the sector. Over\nthe last two decades, the Fund Managers have demonstrated an ability to access high quality\nbiopharmaceutical investments at all stages, by sourcing opportunities through a range of\nactivities that result in differentiated and in many cases proprietary deal flow. Deal flow is\ngenerated by relying on New Leaf’s extensive network of relationships that span senior\nexecutives in the pharmaceutical and biotech companies, top scientists at world-class academic\ninstitutions, and leading investors in the venture capital, private equity, and small cap public\nsectors. By leveraging this network the Fund Managers gain visibility to interesting investment\nideas, and develop insight into the long term strategic interests of the larger pharmaceutical and\nbiotech companies and the evolving attitudes about value and risk of public market investors.\nThrough this continuous process the Fund Managers seek to ensure that they are able to view\nthe widest range of high quality opportunities and have a highly informed and discerning\nscreen to determine which of the opportunities have the greatest long term investment\npotential. It is these efforts that have allowed the New Leaf team to create some of the best\nperforming portfolios of biopharmaceutical investments in the industry in the Sprout Funds\nand in NLV-I and NLV-II, and has resulted in successful and consistent track records of returns\nin the sector. The Fund Managers have demonstrated leadership in the sector over the long\nterm through transactions that span the full range of stages and transaction types, including:\n�\n�\n�\n�\nStart-Ups: The Fund Managers have played important roles and have been founding\ninvestors in a number of successful start-up companies. These have included Pearl\nTherapeutics (NLV-I, exited in sale to Astra Zeneca, 2.5x multiple plus milestones),\nRelypsa (NLV-I, private initially, now public on NASDAQ: RLYP),\nConvergence/Calchan Pharmaceuticals (NLV-II, one start up that subsequently split to\nbecome 2 separate companies), Durata Therapeutics (NLV-II: IPO – July, 2012,\nNASDAQ: DRTX), and Ilypsa (Sprout IX, exited in sale to Amgen, 6.9x multiple).\nEstablished Private Companies: The New Leaf Team has played the role of lead\ninvestor in a large number of private investments. These have included Cerexa (NLV-I,\nexited in sale to Forest Labs, 5.4x multiple), Stromedix (NLV-I, exited in sale to Biogen\nIdec, 1.8x multiple plus milestones), Chimerix (NLV-II, IPO – April, 2013, NASDAQ:\nCMRX), and Auxilium (Sprout IX, NASDAQ: AUXL, exited at 4.6x).\nRestructuring Private Companies: The Fund Managers have led financings that have\nrestructured private companies, providing capital to fund business plans that have\nrefocused company’s business plans on certain key assets and product development\nprograms and significantly reducing or terminating investments into others. Examples\nof this type of investment include Intarcia Therapeutics (NLV-I) and Synageva\nBiopharma (NLV-II, reverse merger to become public – November, 2011, NASDAQ:\nGEVA; exited at 7.3x).\nRestructuring & Recapitalizing Public Companies: The New Leaf team has created\ninteresting investment opportunities through restructuring and recapitalizing public\ncompanies. Examples include MEI Pharma (NLV-II, NASDAQ: MEIP) and Sirna\n34\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nTherapeutics (Sprout IX, formerly NASDAQ: RNAI, exited through sale to Merck, 8.1x\nmultiple).\n�\nStructured Investments in Public Companies: The Fund Managers have led and\nparticipated in a number of structured investments into small cap public companies.\nThese have included Array Pharmaceuticals (NLV-II, NASDAQ: ARRY; led a structured\nfollow-on investment, NLV team member joined the board, exited at 2.25x), Acadia\nPharmaceuticals (NLV-II, NASDAQ: ACAD, exited at 2.5x) and Intercept\nPharmaceuticals (NLV-II, NASDAQ: ICPT; anchored company’s IPO, NLV team\nmember initially joined the company’s board, exited at 3.2x).\nFor a complete list of investments made by the Fund Managers in healthcare technology\ncompanies see Appendix 1.\nFavorable conditions for biopharmaceutical investments for NLV-III\nThe Fund Managers believe that NLV-III will be invested in a market with attractive conditions\nfor investment in the biopharmaceutical sector. As a result, the Fund should have the\nopportunity to invest in compelling biopharmaceutical opportunities that have attractive riskreturn\nprofiles. A number of factors support this positive view of the investment thesis in the\nbiopharmaceuticals sector.\nFirst, the Fund will invest in a portfolio of biopharmaceutical companies with an emphasis on\nthose that are developing targeted therapeutic opportunities that address mechanisms of\ndisease at the molecular level with high specificity and offer meaningful efficacy and safety\nbenefits to specific sub-groups of patients. Where possible, the Fund will look to invest in\ncompanies with product programs that are guided by validated biomarkers that can enable\nhighly specific patient selection and provide an objective measurement of drug effect. The\nFund Managers believe that opportunities with these characteristics offer important benefits to\nall market participants in the biopharmaceuticals sector, and that these substantially de-risk the\nR&D and commercial sides of the biopharmaceutical business model in ways that can\nmeaningfully benefit investors.\nPatients are offered therapies that are more targeted to their disease, and benefit from\nimprovements in efficacy and safety through increased life expectancy, improved quality of life,\nand a more rapid return to a fully productive life;\nPhysicians have access to an arsenal of products that they can choose from to tailor therapy to\nspecific patients’ disease, and avoid the costs and risks associated with using less effective\ntherapies that carry all the safety risks, but may or may not have any effect on the specific\ndisease subtype of an individual patient;\nPayers may pay higher prices for these therapies, but with the enhanced efficacy and safety\nprofile that’s possible with biomarker based targeting, they can expect to see better overall\npatient outcomes, that ultimately save money within the system;\nPharmaceutical Companies benefit because with targeted approaches to drug discovery and\ndevelopment, the probabilities of success improve, interactions with regulators become less\nrisky, timelines to move products from the lab to the market can be significantly shortened, and\n35\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nsales and marketing becomes more efficient as commercial campaigns only need to target those\nphysicians seeing specific subsets of patients;\nRegulatory Authorities evaluate the risk-benefit of new therapeutics on specific subgroups of\npatients that are known to be suffering from a specific sub-type of diseases, and can thus\nrequire fewer patients and shorter timelines in clinical programs, ultimately lowering the risks\nand costs of the approval pathway for developers of new therapeutics; and\nInvestors can expect to see improving returns as the risk/reward equation of drug\ndevelopment is shifted significantly as a result of shortened timelines, smaller clinical trials,\nimproved probabilities of success, and reduced risks at the clinical, regulatory, and commercial\nlevels.\nSecond, the biopharmaceuticals sector is an improving regulatory environment in the U.S.,\nhelping set the stage for a positive investment cycle. There is strong evidence that over the last\ndecade the FDA has been working to improve the drug approval process in the U.S. in tangible\nways that benefit biopharmaceutical companies and reduce the risk for their investors.\nAlthough the path to regulatory approval for product programs has not been made easy by any\nstandard, the FDA has made strides in making the process more predictable and streamlined.\nSome of the most significant improvements have been in therapeutic areas where there is a high\nlevel of unmet medical need. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) is\ndemonstrating clear interest in working more constructively with industry to bring new safe\nand effective therapeutics to market that target diseases that have potentially large cost burdens\non the healthcare system (e.g., oncology). Additionally, the FDA has also improved the way\nthat they communicate and interact with sponsors of new products, by creating set\nadministrative procedures and timelines that they are required to meet through legislation like\nthe Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) and the FDA Modernization Act. The FDA has\nimplemented other initiatives that attempt to clarify requirements and shorten regulatory\ntimelines for certain types of therapeutic products that they view as highest priority. These\ninitiatives include programs to grant special designations, including Breakthrough Therapy,\nAccelerated Approval, and Priority Review, which can cut significant time out of the standard\napproval process. The impact of these and other programs has become apparent in the number\nof new drug approvals (“NDAs”) by FDA in both 2011 (30 NDAs) and 2012 (39 NDAs), which\ntrended higher compared to the previous six years and versus historic averages. 28 Overall,\nthese initiatives and others, both in the U.S. and in other markets (e.g., E.U. and Japan), have\nmade the regulatory environment more favorable for investors in the biopharmaceutical sector,\nand have reduced some of the uncertainty in a critical part of drug development.\nA third factor supporting the positive investment thesis in biopharmaceuticals is the interplay\nof favorable conditions in the capital markets and the strategic needs of the large and mid-sized\ncompanies in the sector. These dynamics should create a positive financing and exit\nenvironment for biopharmaceutical companies for the foreseeable future, and the Fund\nManager expect them to contribute to improving venture returns. The aforementioned\ncontraction in the number of active firms and capital flows into healthcare technology venture\nfunds has significantly reduced the level of competition between firms. At the same time, large\nand mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies have become increasingly dependent on\n28 Food and Drug Administration. Center For Drug Evaluation and Research\n36\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\ndevelopment stage companies as an important source of innovation and new products to\nsupplement R&D pipelines and drive future growth. Strong growth potential is critical for\nthese companies to support their valuation metrics, especially in light of expected patent\nexpirations on their commercial products. In total, over $290 billion of revenue is at risk from\npatent expirations between now and 2018. 29 The large and mid-sized companies are addressing\nthis strategic need to a large extent through increased acquisitions and partnerships with\ndevelopment stage companies that have maturing assets. The Fund Managers expect this\ndynamic to increase competition between the larger strategic players in the industry as they vie\nfor the most interesting companies with maturing development stage assets. The development\nstage companies should have strong negotiating leverage in these deal discussions, which\nshould drive premium valuations on acquisitions and attractive terms on partnerships.\nThe increased strategic need for acquisitions and partnerships comes at a time when the large\nand many of the mid-sized companies in the industry are in a strong financial position to\ncomplete high value deals. The top ten pharmaceutical companies have a total of $140 billion in\ncash on their balance sheets today and have a combined market capitalization of over $1.3\ntrillion. 30 A relatively new set of well funded potential acquirers and/or partners has emerged\nover the last decade, as many of the mid-sized biotech companies have seen their commercial\nbusinesses thrive, and now have strong revenue and profit growth. Since 2002, the number of\npublic biotech companies with annual profit (EBIT) over $100 million has doubled to 16, and the\ncombined annual profit of these companies has increased 4.5 times to $16.6 billion. 31 This has\nsignificantly increased the number of companies in the industry with the financial wherewithal\nto complete large cash transactions. At the same time, the industry’s R&D productivity has\nbeen disappointing in terms of new products generated by massive internal R&D budgets. To\naddress the gaps created in their R&D pipelines, most large and mid-sized players have shifted\na large percentage of their R&D budgets away from internal R&D projects and have increased\ninvestment in “externalizing” a large portion of their R&D. These companies have slashed\ninternal R&D budgets, closed major R&D facilities, and made large cuts to headcount. It is\nestimated that the pharmaceutical industry cut R&D spending by 5.7% in the U.S. and 2.2%\nglobally in 2012 alone, 32 and this trend has continued in 2013. Most large and mid-sized\nbiopharmaceutical companies now have large internal groups that include a combination of\nbusiness and scientific resources that are dedicated exclusively to external search and\nevaluation, and are tasked with finding opportunities for mergers, acquisitions, and\npartnerships that will bring in new technology. Some have taken this strategy even further and\nhave set up their own internal venture capital investment groups with the belief that by coinvesting\nwith more experienced institutional venture investors they can improve their\nvisibility into the latest innovations and improved access to the best opportunities. The Fund\nManagers believe that this combination of financial strength and strategic need to source more\nproducts than internal R&D efforts can produce will lead to a significant increase in deal\nactivity, creating a strong exit environment for smaller development stage companies for the\nforeseeable future.\n29 eValuatePharma\n30 Burrill Biotech 2012 Report\n31 New Leaf Analysis of public company financial data as provided by Bloomberg\n32 Battelle-R&D Magazine Annual Global R&D Funding Forecast\n37\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nThe Fund Managers expect this combination of positive market conditions to remain favorable\nfor generating attractive returns in the biopharmaceutical sector for the foreseeable future.\nAlthough industry returns have been characterized by inconsistency and generally associated\nwith long timelines, a small number of top investors have been able to consistently build\nportfolios that outperform the venture capital industry and relevant public market indices.\nThere is no substitute for experience in this sector, and the New Leaf team brings one of the\nmost powerful and proven combinations of team, strategy, and track record to investing in this\ndynamic sector, and is positioned well for continued success in NLV-III.\nINFORMATION CONVERGENCE INVESTMENT STRATEGY\nThe Fund Managers believe that U.S. is rapidly approaching a fiscal crisis that will be driven\nlargely by rising healthcare expenditures and the exponential increase in future healthcare\nliabilities. This looming threat is a major driver behind Information Convergence (“I.C.”), the\nsecond of the two primary focus areas in NLV-III. Governments and the private sector alike are\nbeing forced to significantly increase the efficiency of the healthcare system, and consequently\nare beginning to invest heavily in technologies that reduce cost and improve the quality of care.\nNew technology solutions are emerging from the intersection of a diverse, yet interconnected\nset of technologies that define Information Convergence, including cloud storage, mobile\ncomputing, wireless communications, web-delivered software, big data analytics, diagnostics\nand sensors.\nI.C. companies are integrating these technologies in ways that more cost effectively prevent,\ndiagnose, and treat disease. These applications and products can be highly valued by\naddressing costly inefficiencies within the healthcare system. The Fund Managers believe I.C.\nwill play an enabling role in many of the initiatives that will form the core of healthcare reform,\nincluding the transformation of healthcare reimbursement models from volume to value-based,\nand that this will be a major area of opportunity for investors for the foreseeable future.\nWithin I.C. the Fund will seek opportunities that target some of the largest inefficiencies in the\nhealthcare system. These include: (1) inefficiency in delivery of care and excess administrative\ncosts; (2) unnecessary services and missed opportunities for prevention; and (3) inflated pricing\nand fraud. Coming out of these large, identified problem areas are a number of discrete\ninvestable themes. These are the primary target of New Leaf’s investment strategy in I.C. and\nthey include the following:\nProblem Area: Inefficient Delivery and Excess Administrative Costs\n�\nInvestment Theme - Operational & Care Delivery Efficiency: Process improvement and\noptimization can only occur when data is available to identify the problems and\nmeasure the impact of solutions. With shrinking margins and shifting value objectives,\nhealthcare providers are under pressure to understand and improve their businesses\nand operations. Technologies that allow the collection and analysis of relevant data on\nthe efficiency of care-delivery will be foundational to this evolution. AwarePoint (NLV-\nII) delivers enterprise awareness solutions for the hospital and other healthcare facilities,\nis an example of a company fitting this theme.\n38\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n�\n�\nInvestment Theme - Care Coordination: Today in healthcare, most conditions require the\ninvolvement of multiple healthcare professionals, including primary care physicians,\nspecialists, nurses, assistants, and therapists, and the care they provide must be\nmanaged closely with participation from the patients themselves and their family\nmembers. Unfortunately, poor coordination and information sharing amongst\ncaregivers creates significant inefficiencies at the points of hand-off between providers,\nleading to repeat tests, missed diagnoses, and expensive mistakes that diminish\noutcomes, and in some cases put patients at substantial risk. TigerText (NLV-II) has\ndeveloped a secure text messaging platform that can be used on any mobile phone that\nallows healthcare professionals to rapidly communicate and exchange clinical data files\nto improve and coordinate care.\nInvestment Theme - Clinical Error Reduction: Administrative, medication and procedural\nerrors are responsible for billions of dollars of cost annually in the U.S. healthcare\nsystem. Many of these problems can be reduced by bringing relevant information into\nthe right setting at the appropriate time. For example, ePocrates (Sprout IX, NASDAQ:\nEPOC – Acquired by athenahealth for $293 million, 3.1x multiple) allows physicians to\nquickly reference drug formulary, dosing and interaction information, thus reducing the\nerror rate in prescriptions.\nProblem Area: Unnecessary Services & Missed Prevention Opportunities\n�\nInvestment Theme - Analytics & Data-Driven Personalization: Many conditions are currently\ndiagnosed on single or limited data points, measured in the hospital or physicians’\noffice, that may not accurately reflect (or detect) the patients’ condition. Examples\ninclude diseases with episodic or fluctuating symptoms such as cardiac arrhythmias,\nParkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, depression and other behavioral health issues. iRhythm\nTechnologies (NLV-II) developed and markets an innovative, highly wearable, patch\ntechnology capable of recording continuous electrocardiograms for up to 14 days. This\nproduct has demonstrated a 5x improvement in diagnostic yield for cardiac arrhythmias\nrelative to 24 - 48 hour Holter monitoring.\nThe large scale deployment of electronic medical records (“EMRs”), healthcare\ninformation exchanges, and diagnostic and monitoring technologies, is driving\nexponential growth in professional health data around patient care and outcomes. At\nthe same time, patients are discussing and sharing their own health care experiences and\npersonal health data involving providers, therapeutics, and procedures on the internet.\nThese vast and rapidly growing professional and consumer oriented healthcare data sets\ncreate an unprecedented repository of longitudinal data on populations of patients. By\nmining these data sets using big-data techniques and technologies that are being\ndeployed successfully in other industries, it is possible to identify important findings\nthat have huge commercial value that might previously have never have been detected.\nSpecifically, the Fund Managers believe analytics applied to these data sets will allow\ncare gaps to be readily identified and addressed, and best practices to be frequently\nrevised, leading to a consistent iterative cycle of improvement. Treato (NLV-II) has\ndeveloped a social health intelligence platform (aka “Social Listening”) that identifies,\nanalyzes and aggregates medical user generated content spread widely across the web\n39\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nin thousands of blogs and other written forums and converts this unstructured content\ninto structured information to support better-informed decision making by patients,\nproviders, and pharmaceutical marketing teams.\n�\nInvestment Theme - Patient Engagement / Shift to Low-Cost Setting: As incentives move\naway from procedural volume and towards cost-effective quality and outcomes,\nproviders and care delivery organizations are seeking ways to deliver care outside of the\nhospital or physicians’ office through technologies that may allow remote monitoring,\nand empowers other healthcare professionals, or even patients to play a greater role in\npatient care and well-being. Audax Health (NLV-II; exited at 3.4x) touches on this\ntheme with its Zensey product, which engages patients in their own health through\nprograms endorsed by their payer.\nProblem Area: Inflated Pricing & Fraud\n�\nInvestment Theme - Price & Cost Transparency, Financial Error Reduction: Error reduction\ncan generate significant cost savings at the enterprise level. Truveris (NLV-II) allows\nself-insured employers to verify the accuracy of all pharmaceutical benefit claims from\ntheir pharmacy benefit managers in real time, thus resulting in more accurate payments\nand significant cost savings.\nThese are just some of the illustrative themes for I.C. investments in NLV-III. This is an\nemerging area with strong growth drivers, and the Fund Managers expect the opportunity set\nto evolve and broaden substantially over NLV-III’s investment cycle.\nAn intriguing aspect of this sector is the possibility for significantly shortened development\ntimelines and product iteration cycles. Particularly because they are usually outside the\njurisdiction of the FDA and standard reimbursement paths, companies in the I.C. sector can\ndevelop and launch products in months not years, and for single digit millions rather than\nseveral tens of millions of dollars. Product development for these types of applications\nleverages “off-the-shelf technologies” in sensors, communications, software and web\ndesign/deployment that were invented and validated in non-healthcare market segments.\nThese products can be quickly and cheaply tested, iterated and refined in the marketplace with\ncustomers while generating early revenue, which provides a greater degree of flexibility to\nevolve the right solution through a series of incremental improvements rather than a single\ntrack, expensive and prolonged development effort.\nThe Fund’s I.C. investments will be predominantly in private companies in the U.S, at or near\ncommercialization. Similar to the biopharmaceutical strategy, New Leaf’s objective in its I.C.\ninvestments is to build ownership positions that are large enough to allow the Fund Managers\nto exert influence on the company, and to actively manage the investments through board\nparticipation. In certain circumstances, NLV may initially take smaller positions with plans to\nsignificantly increase the Fund’s investment as the companies make progress through key early\ntechnical or commercial hurdles. Utilizing this strategy, the Fund Managers expect to build\nlarger positions around select investments as they are progressively de-risked, and may not\ncontinue to support investments that do not demonstrate appropriate progress.\n40\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nThe New Leaf team is one of the most experienced and proven teams in this sector. The Fund\nManagers’ combination of proven track record, in-depth knowledge of the medical device and\ndiagnostics fields, a strong current I.C. portfolio, and a thought-leading network of I.C.\nadvisors, puts New Leaf in a position of leadership within this sector.\nMEDICAL DEVICES INVESTMENT STRATEGY\nNLV-III’s investment strategy in medical devices will focus on identifying a limited number of\ninvestment opportunities in companies with compelling later stage risk profiles. The Fund will\nseek to identify investments in companies that are developing innovative and differentiated\nmedical devices, targeting large market opportunities, that offer the potential to meaningfully\nreduce overall patient treatment costs in high morbidity disease settings through substantial\nefficacy and safety benefits versus existing standards of care. Investments in this sector will\nhave established regulatory approval pathways and clear regulatory precedents, or are already\nat the commercial stage at the time of initial investment. The objective will be to identify\ncompanies that because of their specific therapeutic area or technology focus, or because the\ncompany already has received key regulatory approvals, that they will be less affected by the\nheadwinds that are challenging the sector more broadly. Importantly, these investments will be\nin therapeutic areas that are known to be of high strategic interest to a number of larger medical\ndevice companies, and thus have a high potential of generating M&A interest. The primary\nrisks in these investments will be mostly operational execution, competition, and other market\nrelated risks.\nSimilar to the second half of the investment period for NLV-II, the Fund will have a more\nlimited focus on medical device investments in NLV-III compared to previous funds. The\nslower projected pace of investment is based on the view that the operating and exit\nenvironment for companies in this sector will continue to be challenging due to increased\nregulatory and reimbursement uncertainty in the U.S. and E.U. These headwinds have resulted\nin increased development costs and significantly lengthened timelines for most development\nstage companies.\nWhile the Fund Managers expect to see fewer compelling investment opportunities than have\nbeen available historically in the medical device sector, they do believe that they will be able to\nidentify and source a number of later stage opportunities that are less affected by these\nobstacles, and that these will be attractive investment opportunities for NLV-III. One factor that\nsupports this view is that the reduced level of competition for deals resulting from the decline\nin the number of active venture capital firms mentioned previously is even more pronounced in\nthe medical device sector. Given New Leaf’s historic leadership within this sector, and its clear\ncommitment to remain active during this period of reduced funding, the Fund Managers expect\nthat they will have excellent deal flow. Although the number of deals in this sector is likely to\nbe somewhat lower than in previous funds, with the later stage focus, it is likely that the size of\ninvestments in this sector will be larger. Recent medical device investments in the New Leaf\nportfolio that fit this later stage definition include: Neuronetics (NLV-II, commercial stage),\nCardioKinetix (NLV-II, clinical development stage), and Interlace Medical (NLV-I, start-up\nfocused on 510k product, acquired by Hologix, exited at 8.6x).\n41\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH TOOLS & INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT STRATEGY\nNLV-III’s investment strategy in Biological Research Tools and Infrastructure will focus on\nidentifying companies that are at or near the commercial stage with novel products targeting\nestablished, high growth markets -- such as DNA sequencing and personalized medicine. The\nproducts of interest will be those based on differentiated technologies that offer higher quality\nbiological results at significant cost savings to customers than current products. The investment\ntheses for these companies will be based on rapidly building high-gross margins businesses that\nreach break-even on manageable timelines and limited capital budgets. An example of a tools\ncompany in the New Leaf portfolio is Advanced Cellular Diagnostics (NLV-II, commercial\nstage).\nResearch tools and infrastructure technology companies are benefiting from several positive\nhealthcare industry tailwinds. Technology advancements over the past decade, such as genomic\nsequencing and personalized diagnostics, have generated the need for additional reagents and\ninstruments to efficiently interrogate vast amounts of biological samples and process massive\nquantities of resulting data. Unlike biopharmaceutical or medical device product development,\nthese new reagents are not subject to the risks of costly clinical trials, regulatory approvals and\npayer reimbursement. Thus, timelines are more manageable and predictable, and budgets are\nmuch more capital efficient. In fact, in this sector, the Fund Managers expect to identify\nopportunities for investment in technologies that have been largely de-risked, are commercialready,\nand can be funded to profitability on VC dollars. While substantial commercial adoption\nwill likely be required for most companies in this sector to be acquired, given the high margins,\nrapid sales adoption, and relatively low sales and marketing costs, funding the launch of a new\ntool or technology in this sector can represent an attractive risk-reward investment.\nThis dynamic sector is growing rapidly and small companies have been a prolific source of\ninnovative new products for the large, established companies that dominate the commercial\ndistribution channels. The Fund will approach this sector opportunistically and will invest in a\nsmall number of companies with novel and clearly differentiated products targeting sectors of\nrapid growth that are at or near the commercial stage.\nThe Fund Managers expect investments in this sector and the medical device sector to comprise\nup to 15% of the Fund.\n42\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nVI. DEAL SOURCING & INVESTMENT PROCESS\nThe Fund Managers have a proactive approach to deal sourcing, which focuses on both private\nand public opportunities. The established and proven sourcing activities seek to identify the\nmost compelling healthcare technology investment opportunities, at the most attractive time\npoints for venture capital investment. The Fund Managers’ goal is to identify opportunities that\nare based on the most interesting novel and proprietary technologies, but place their emphasis\non being positioned for investing in these technologies in the round(s) that offer the most\nattractive risk-adjusted returns potential. These investment opportunities are identified\nthrough a number of parallel efforts, including:\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\nSystematic tracking of private and public companies that have product programs and\ntechnologies targeting disease areas and biological targets of high interest that are\napproaching key value inflection points. Current activities include comprehensive\nscreening of companies with programs targeting high unmet medical needs where the\nstrength of the science coupled with a rapid and lower capital intensity development\npath, provides a compelling risk-reward case for investment. At the present time, the\nFund Managers are tracking a biopharma investment universe of approximately 1,000\nmid-late stage private and small-cap public companies, many of which are in\ntherapeutic areas of specific interest to the Fund Managers (e.g. Oncology, Infectious\nDisease, Central Nervous System, etc.);\nContinuous contact with a network of current and former portfolio company\nmanagement teams;\nNetworking with current and former senior management team members from leading\npharmaceutical, biotech, medical device, and HIT companies to understand their\nstrategic priorities and to identify assets/programs that may become available for\nspinouts or structured financings;\nStaying up to date and in contact with leading academic thought leaders working in\nNLV’s fields of interest;\nActive coverage of major investor, medical and scientific meetings; and\nWorking closely with other venture capitalists with overlapping interests to ensure NLV\nsees the broadest range of high quality opportunities and are positioned for working\nwith the strongest syndicates.\nA key success factor behind the Fund Managers’ deal sourcing activities is a strong network of\nentrepreneurs, industry executives, renowned clinicians, leading academic scientists, other\nventure investors, and experienced consultants. The Fund Managers believe that this network\nplays a critical role in helping to identify the most interesting opportunities, bringing the\nleading resources to bear to assist in due diligence, and in providing important technical and\nrecruiting support in building portfolio companies. The Fund Managers continuously invest\ntime and energy in updating and building this strong network to ensure access to the managers\nand thought leaders that are the industry’s leaders in the sectors of interest.\n43\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nThe New Leaf team applies a rigorous, systematic, fundamentals-driven approach to diligence\non all new deals, which, in addition to assessment against the sector specific strategies, includes\nconsideration of the following risk/reward factors:\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\nMedical need and market size\nCompeting therapies, both drugs and devices\nStrength of intellectual property\nEase of physician adoption of new therapy\nSpecific details of clinical trial design and trial execution risks\nRegulatory and reimbursement risks across relevant geographies\nManagement team’s ability to both execute the business plan and the exit\nTime and money required to reach next important milestone(s)\nLikely exit; potential acquirers, IPO prospects.\nThe Fund Managers will continue their proven investment philosophy and investment process,\nwhich emphasizes a team approach to proactive deal sourcing, rigorous investment analysis,\nsignificant involvement with portfolio companies and active management of investments and\nexits, and a focus on key “risk inflection” points based on the disease and technology.\nInvestments will include both development stage and start-up stage companies, as well as\ngrowth equity or expansion capital investment in NLV-III’s targeted sectors, in the private and\npublic markets.\nThe Fund Managers have a long history of separating the roles of transaction finder,\nnegotiating/closing the transaction, and board member, as needed. New Leaf seeks to put the\nmost appropriate investment professional on the board of companies, based on experience. The\nFund Managers have fostered a culture that discourages any professional from feeling the need\nto control all aspects of an investment. Credit is given for each professional’s role, and for each\nteam member’s ability to be a team player. New Leaf seeks to avoid “lone ranger” behavior and\ninstead actively implements a team approach.\nThe Fund Managers intend to create a very selective portfolio of 24 to 28 companies, which will\ninclude a balanced mix of investments in private companies and small capitalization public\ncompanies. The targeted portfolio is expected to be diversified across biopharmaceuticals (50 -\n60%), information convergence (up to 25%), and the remainder across investments in later stage\nmedical device and biological tools and infrastructure companies. While the Fund Managers\nbelieve this distribution of investments is the most likely outcome, it also intends to take full\nadvantage of pricing discontinuities should they emerge in any of the identified sectors of\ninterest, possibly resulting in variance from this targeted allocation.\n44\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nVII. ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH SPROUT FUNDS\nSince 2005, the Fund Managers have managed the remaining portfolio of healthcare technology\ninvestments in Sprout Capital VII, L.P., Sprout Capital VIII, L.P., and Sprout Capital IX, L.P.\nunder a Sub-Management Agreement between Credit Suisse and New Leaf Venture Partners,\nL.L.C. (the “Management Company”). In return for these management services, the\nManagement Company had received a portion of the management fee collected by those Sprout\nfunds related to the healthcare portfolio.\nAt the present time, Sprout Capital IX, L.P. is the only fund with any remaining active\nhealthcare technology investments. There were six active health care technology companies\n(three board seats) in the Sprout Capital IX, L.P. portfolio that are managed by the Fund\nManagers, which represented $68 million of carrying value as of March 31, 2014. These\nremaining investments are in mature companies and the Fund Managers intend to continue to\nmanage the investments with an emphasis on finding exit opportunities for each company at an\nappropriate time. The Fund Managers have already exited a portion of these companies in\nearly 2014, leaving a very limited tail of Sprout investments and board seats.\nThe Fund Managers expect the arrangement with Credit Suisse to continue for the foreseeable\nfuture, but the Management Company no longer receives any management fees for these\nservices. The Sub-Management Agreement between Credit Suisse and the Management\nCompany will wind down and eventually be terminated as the investments in the Sprout\nCapital IX, L.P. portfolio are exited.\n45\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nVIII.

The General Partner\nintends to conduct the operations of the Fund so that it will be\nan appropriate investment for ERISA Plans. In particular, the\nGeneral Partner will use reasonable best efforts to conduct the\naffairs and operations of the Fund in such a manner so that the\nassets of the Fund will not be treated as “plan assets” of any\nERISA Plan for purposes of ERISA. Prospective investors that\nare ERISA Plans are advised to consult their own advisors as to\nthe effect of ERISA (or other applicable law) on an investment in\nthe Fund. The fiduciary of each prospective ERISA Plan\ninvestor must independently determine that the Fund is an\nappropriate investment for such ERISA Plan, taking into\naccount the fiduciary’s obligations under ERISA and the facts\nand circumstances of each investing ERISA Plan.

CERTAIN INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS\nAn investment in the Fund entails a significant degree of risk and, therefore, should be undertaken only\nby investors capable of evaluating the risks of the Fund and bearing the risks it represents. There can be\nno assurance that the Fund’s investment objectives will be achieved or that an investor will receive a\nreturn of its capital, and therefore, an investor should only invest in the Fund if such investor is able to\nwithstand a total loss of its investment. In addition, there will be occasions when the General Partner\nand its affiliates may encounter potential conflicts of interest in connection with the Fund. Prospective\ninvestors in the Fund should carefully consider the following factors in connection with an investment in\nthe Fund. The following is not a complete list of all risks involved in connection with an investment in\nthe Fund. In addition to the items discussed below, prospective investors should also consider the\ninformation described in Section XI, “Certain Tax & ERISA Considerations” and elsewhere in this\nMemorandum. Prospective investors are cautioned not to rely on the prior returns set forth in this\nMemorandum in making a decision whether or not to purchase the Limited Partner Interests offered\nhereby. The return information contained in this Memorandum has not been audited or verified by any\nindependent party and should not be considered representative of the returns that may be received by an\ninvestor in the Fund. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.\nRisk of Venture Capital Investments\nWhile venture capital investments offer the opportunity for significant gains, such investments\nalso involve a high degree of business and financial risk and can result in substantial losses.\nAmong these risks are the general risks associated with investing in companies at an early state\nof development or with little or no operating history, companies operating at a loss or with\nsubstantial variations in operating results from period to period, and companies with the need\nfor substantial additional capital to support expansion or to achieve or maintain a competitive\nposition. Such companies may face intense competition, including from companies with greater\nfinancial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, marketing and service\ncapabilities and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. Due to the\nlimited number of investments that the Fund may make, poor performance by some of the\nFund’s investments could significantly affect the total returns to Limited Partners.\nFocused Investment Strategy\nThe Fund will be focused on life sciences and healthcare technology investments and may not\nenjoy the reduced risks of a broadly diversified portfolio. A specific investment focus is\ninherently more risky and could cause the Fund’s investments to be more susceptible to\nparticular economic, political, regulatory, technological or industry conditions or occurrences\ncompared with a fund, or a portfolio of funds, that is more diversified or has a broader industry\nfocus.\nRisks Associated with Investments in Life Sciences and Healthcare Technology Companies\nThe success of the Fund’s portfolio companies may be dependent upon obtaining certain\ngovernmental approvals. Companies in the life sciences and healthcare technology industry\ntypically require the approval of agencies such as the FDA prior to marketing their products to\nthe public. Of particular significance are the FDA requirements covering research and\ndevelopment, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling and promotion of drugs for\nhuman use. The approval process is very lengthy and very costly, and there can be no\nguarantee that a portfolio company will obtain the necessary approvals for its products. If a\nportfolio company is unable to obtain these approvals in a timely fashion, the portfolio\n58\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\ncompany may experience significant adverse effects, which in turn could negatively affect the\nperformance of the Fund. Moreover, the current regulatory framework may change or\nadditional regulations may arise at any stage during the product development phase of a\nportfolio company, which may affect the company’s ability to obtain approval of its products.\nThe Fund may invest in companies that will need to obtain patents for their products, both in\nthe U.S. and in other countries. The patent protection of the intellectual property of healthcare\ntechnology companies in many countries is highly uncertain and involves complex legal,\nscientific and factual issues. The policy regarding allowable claimed subject matter of life\nsciences or healthcare technology patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nDependence on Single Products\nCompanies in which the Fund invests may only have one product under development. There\ncan be no assurance that the product will be approved for marketing by the FDA or any foreign\nregulatory agency. Further, competition to the product may develop from other new and\nexisting products. In either case, if a company is dependent on that one product, the\nconsequences of such failure could be devastating to the prospects of such company, which in\nturn could negatively affect the performance of the Fund.\nDependence on Reimbursement and Third-Party Pricing Policies for Products\nThe ability of the Fund’s portfolio companies to commercialize any product candidate\nsuccessfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products\nand related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities,\nprivate health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party\npayors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which\nmedications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A major trend in the U.S.\nhealthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party\npayors, particularly Medicare, have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the\namount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are\nrequiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and\nare challenging the prices charged for medical products. Portfolio companies cannot be sure\nthat coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that they commercialize,\nand, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory.\nReimbursement may affect the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which a\nportfolio company obtains marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate\nreimbursement for a portfolio company’s products may be particularly difficult because of the\nhigher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician or\nbecause a drug may be administered in combination with other drugs that may carry high\nprices. A portfolio company may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies\nto justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies.\nIf coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to\nlimited levels, a portfolio company may not be able to successfully commercialize any product\ncandidate for which it obtains marketing approval. This, in turn, could negatively affect the\nperformance of the Fund.\n59\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and\ncoverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or\nsimilar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement\ndoes not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers a portfolio\ncompany’s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim\nreimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover a portfolio\ncompany’s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to\nthe use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement\nlevels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for\nother services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required\nby government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that\npresently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than\nin the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment\nlimitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. A portfolio company’s inability to\npromptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and\nprivate payors for any approved products that a portfolio company may develop could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on its operating results, its ability to raise capital needed to\ncommercialize products and its overall financial condition. This, in turn, could negatively affect\nthe performance of the Fund.\nPolitical Risk; Current and Future Healthcare Reforms\nPolitical events can have an impact on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. There can\nbe no guarantee that government’s role in the healthcare industry will not adversely impact the\nperformance of the Fund.\nIn both the U.S. and foreign markets, sales of healthcare products and services and their success\nwill depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors such as\ngovernment health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations.\nThe levels of revenues and profitability of providers of healthcare products and services may be\naffected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce\nthe costs of health care. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly\napproved health care products. There can be no assurance that a company’s proposed products\nor services will be considered cost-effective or that adequate third-party reimbursement will be\navailable to enable a company to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return\non its investment.\nMoreover, there continues to be significant interest among policy makers and government and\nprivate payors in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in promoting changes in healthcare\nsystems to contain healthcare costs and improve the overall quality of care and wellness.\nFor example, on March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act, which Congress modified pursuant to the Health Care and Education\nReconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Act”). The Act expands insurance coverage to\nmore individuals, which could have a negative impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Among\nthe aspects of the Act that may have an adverse impact on the Fund are (i) mandatory annual\nfees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, (ii) discounts of 50% on brand name prescription drugs\nfor certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries (i.e., those who are required to pay 100% of their\n60\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nprescription drug costs during the temporary “gap” from Medicare coverage until their\nprescription drug costs reach the threshold for catastrophic coverage by Medicare), (iii) an\napproval process for generic biologics and granting exclusive marketing rights to original\nmanufacturers for 12 years, (iv) increased drug rebates to the Medicaid program, and (v)\ndisclosure requirements for financial relationships between various healthcare entities.\nWithin the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of both state and\nfederal governments’ reform efforts. Other than reform measures adopted in the Act, proposed\nreforms include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• increasing regulation of pharmaceutical sales representatives;\n• restricting direct to consumer advertising and off-label uses;\n• limiting manufacturers’ access to marketing data;\n• authorizing the importation of drugs from Canada and other foreign countries to lower\npharmaceutical costs to U.S. consumers;\n• price discounts, formularies or rebates to government healthcare programs; and\n• allowing government healthcare programs to negotiate prescription drug prices directly\nwith manufacturers.\nWhile the Fund cannot predict which legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or\nwhat affect the adopted proposals, including the Act, may have on the biopharmaceutical\ncompanies in which the Fund invests, the pendency, approval or implementation of such\nproposals could decrease the Fund’s anticipated returns or adversely affect its investment\nopportunities.\nAvailability of Investment Capital\nMany portfolio companies will require several rounds of capital infusions before reaching\nmaturity. The Fund and its co-investors may not provide all necessary follow-on capital to\nportfolio companies. Accordingly, third-party sources of financing may be required. There is\nno assurance that such additional sources of financing will be available, or, if available, will be\non terms beneficial to the Fund. Furthermore, the Fund’s capital is limited and may not be\nadequate to protect the Fund from dilution resulting from multiple rounds of portfolio\ncompany financings. If the Fund does not have capital available to participate in subsequent\nrounds of financing, failure to participate may have a significant negative impact on the\nportfolio company as well as the value of the Fund’s investment.\nEconomic and Market Risk\nCompanies in which the Fund invests may be sensitive to general downward swings in the\noverall economy or in the healthcare technology sector. Changes in economic conditions,\nincluding, for example, inflation rates, industry conditions, competition, technological\ndevelopments, political and diplomatic events and trends, tax laws and innumerable other\nfactors, none of which will be within the control of the General Partner, can affect substantially\nand adversely the business and prospects of the Fund. A major recession or adverse\ndevelopments in the securities market might have an impact on some or all of the Fund’s\ninvestments. In addition, factors specific to a portfolio company may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund’s investment in such company. The General Partner may rely upon its own or a\nportfolio company’s projections concerning the portfolio company’s future performance in\nmaking investment decisions. Such projections are inherently subject to uncertainty and to\n61\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\ncertain factors beyond the control of the portfolio company and the General Partner. The\neconomic environment for all companies, and in particular for healthcare technology and startup\ncompanies, may remain challenging. Business risks may be more significant in portfolio\ncompanies embarking on a build-up or operating turnaround strategy and in smaller or\ndevelopment stage portfolio companies. All portfolio companies may face intense competition,\nchanging business and economic conditions, risks of technological acceptance and obsolescence\nor other developments that may adversely affect their performance.\nIlliquidity of Portfolio Investments\nInvestments by the Fund generally will be illiquid securities acquired through privately\nnegotiated transactions. The Fund may be unable to realize its investment objectives by sale or\nother disposition at attractive prices or will otherwise be unable to complete an exit strategy.\nExternal factors beyond the General Partner’s control, such as overall economic conditions, the\ncompetitive environment and the availability of potential acquirors of the Fund’s interests in\nportfolio companies may shorten or lengthen the Fund’s holding period in such portfolio\ncompanies. In some cases, the Fund may be prohibited by contract from selling such securities\nfor a period of time or otherwise may be restricted from the disposition of such securities.\nLack of Operating History\nThe Fund and the General Partner are newly formed entities, and, accordingly have no\noperating history or investments upon which investors can evaluate the potential performance\nof the Fund. The prior performance of the Fund Managers or their investments as described in\nthis Memorandum is not necessarily indicative of the Fund’s future results. There can be no\nassurance that investments by the Fund will achieve returns comparable to the historical\nperformance reflected in this Memorandum, and in any event, the returns achieved by the Fund\nwill be subject to the Management Fee and the General Partner’s carried interest. Any given\ninvestment made by the Fund may prove to be worthless, and there is a risk that investors\ncould lose money.\nNo Assurance of Profit or Distributions\nThe Fund’s task of identifying opportunities in private and public operating companies,\nmanaging such investments and realizing a significant return for investors is difficult. Many\norganizations operated by persons of competence and integrity have been unable to make,\nmanage and realize such investments successfully. There is no assurance that the investments\nof the Fund will be profitable or that any distribution will be made to the Limited Partners.\nAny return on investment to the Limited Partners will depend upon successful investments\nbeing made by the Fund. The marketability and value of any such investment will depend\nupon many factors beyond the control of the Fund. The Fund may not have sufficient cash\navailable to make tax distributions to the Partners. The expenses of the Fund may exceed its\nincome, and the Limited Partners could lose the entire amount of their contributed capital.\nAccordingly, prospective investors should not subscribe to the Fund unless they can readily\nbear the consequences of such a loss.\nCompetition\nThe business of identifying, structuring and implementing venture capital investments, along\nwith other investments within the strategy of NLV-III is highly competitive. The Fund will be\ncompeting for investments against other groups, including institutional investors, investment\nmanagers and industrial groups owned by large and well-capitalized investors. It is possible\n62\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nthat competition for appropriate investment opportunities may limit significantly the number of\nopportunities available to the Fund and adversely affect the terms upon which investments can\nbe made. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be successful in its efforts to identify\nattractive investment opportunities, and it is possible that the Fund’s Commitments will not be\nfully utilized if sufficient attractive investments are not identified and consummated by the\nFund during the Investment Period.\nManagement of the Fund\nThe General Partner will make decisions with respect to the management of the Fund. Limited\nPartners have no right or power to take part in the management of the Fund. The Limited\nPartners will not receive the detailed financial information issued by portfolio companies that\nwill be available to the Fund. Accordingly, the Limited Partners will not have the opportunity\nto evaluate the relevant economic, financial and other information that will be utilized by the\nGeneral Partner in its selection of investments. An investor in the Fund must rely upon the\nability of the General Partner with the assistance of the Management Company to identify,\nstructure, and implement investments consistent with the Fund’s investment objectives and\npolicies. Accordingly, no person should purchase Limited Partner Interests unless such person\nis willing to entrust all aspects of the management of the Fund to the General Partner.\nReliance on Management of Fund\nThe success of the Fund will be largely dependent upon the activities of the Fund Managers.\nThe loss of one or more of these individuals could have a significant adverse impact on the\nbusiness of the Fund and its financial performance.\nReliance Upon Portfolio Company Management\nAlthough the Fund may seek representation on the board of directors of each of the portfolio\ncompanies or otherwise provide management and strategic planning assistance, the Fund will\nnot have an active role in the day-to-day management of the companies in which it invests. To\nthe extent that the senior management of a portfolio company performs poorly, or if a key\nmanager of a portfolio company terminates employment, the Fund’s investment in such\ncompany could be adversely affected.\nPotential Conflicts of Interest\nThe Fund Managers will continue to devote a portion of their time to the business of the Sprout\nFunds, NLV-I, NLV-II and to any future funds that they may organize in accordance with the\nPartnership Agreement. Conflicts may arise in the allocation of investment opportunities and\nthe Fund Managers’ time among the Fund and other such partnerships and any such future\nfunds. Prospective investors should be aware that there may be occasions when the General\nPartner, the Fund Managers, the Management Company and their affiliates will encounter\npotential conflicts of interest in connection with the Fund’s activities. The Partnership\nAgreement will contain certain protections for Limited Partners against conflicts of interest\nfaced by the General Partner and its partners, but will not purport to address all types of\nconflicts that may arise. Moreover, as a practical matter, it may be difficult for Limited Partners\nto subject the behavior of the General Partner, the Management Company and their partners to\nclose scrutiny.\n63\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nProfits Not Shared in Proportion to Contributed Capital\nThe capital contribution of the General Partner will represent only a small portion of the Fund’s\ncapital. Limited Partners may invest greater amounts and may receive a proportionately\nsmaller amount of the profits of the Fund than the General Partner. The General Partner may\nhave an incentive to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than if the General\nPartner received allocations on a basis identical to that of the Limited Partners in the Fund or\nwas compensated on a basis not tied to the performance of the Fund.\nInvestment Opportunities\nThe General Partner may in certain circumstances allocate investment opportunities to prior\nfunds or potential successor funds. Allocation of investment opportunities will be made in\ngood faith by the General Partner. There can be no assurance that the allocation of investment\nopportunities by the General Partner will not give rise to conflicts of interest between the\ninvestors of the respective funds.\nLong-Term Investment\nAn investment in the Fund is a long-term commitment, and there is no assurance of any\ndistribution to the Limited Partners prior to or upon liquidation of the Fund.\nIlliquidity of Limited Partner Interests\nThe Limited Partner Interests are highly illiquid. There is no public market for the Limited\nPartner Interests and none is expected to develop. Limited Partner Interests in the Fund may\nnot be assigned, transferred or encumbered without the prior written consent of the General\nPartner. Voluntary withdrawals of Limited Partner Interests are not permitted, except in\nlimited circumstances where necessary to comply with laws or regulations applicable to a\nLimited Partner. Consequently, a Limited Partner may not be able to liquidate their investment\nin the event of a change in circumstances or for other reasons and, therefore, must be prepared\nto bear the risks of owning its interest in the Fund for an extended period of time. The Limited\nPartner Interests will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\n“Securities Act”), or under the various “Blue Sky” or securities laws of the state or jurisdiction\nof residence of any Limited Partner of the Fund. The Limited Partner Interests are being offered\nonly to “accredited investors” under an exemption in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and the\nrules of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and exemptions under the various\napplicable “Blue Sky” and other state securities laws.\nBridge Financings and Guarantees\nFrom time to time, the Fund may lend to portfolio companies on a short-term, unsecured basis\nor guaranty portfolio company obligations in anticipation of a future issuance of equity or longterm\ndebt securities. Such bridge loans would typically be convertible into a more permanent,\nlong-term security; however, for reasons not always in the Fund’s control, such long-term\nsecurities may not issue and such bridge loans or guarantees may remain outstanding. In such\nevent, the interest rate on such loans or compensation for such guaranty (if any) may not\nadequately reflect the risk associated with the unsecured position taken or guaranty given by\nthe Fund.\n64\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nPortfolio Company Leverage\nTo the extent that any investment is made in a portfolio company with a leveraged capital\nstructure, such investment will be subject to increased exposure to adverse economic factors\nsuch as a significant rise in interest rates, a severe downturn in the economy or deterioration in\nthe condition of such company or its industry. If such a company is unable to generate\nsufficient cash flow to meet principal and interest payments on its indebtedness, the value of\nany equity investment by the Fund in such company could be significantly reduced or even\neliminated.\nInvestments in Public Companies\nThe Fund may invest in public companies or take private portfolio companies public.\nInvestments in public companies may subject the Fund to risks that differ in type or degree\nfrom those involved with investments in privately held companies. Such risks include, without\nlimitation, greater volatility in the valuation of such companies, increased obligations to\ndisclose information regarding such companies, limitations on the ability of the Fund to dispose\nof securities at certain times (including due to the possession by the Fund of material non-public\ninformation), increased likelihood of shareholder litigation against such companies’ board\nmembers, which may include the Fund Managers or other Management Company personnel,\nregulatory action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and increased costs\nassociated with each of the aforementioned risks.\nHedging Techniques\nFrom time to time, the Fund might have investments that are publicly traded, yet illiquid. The\nGeneral Partner might engage in hedging techniques, such as selling the corresponding shares\nshort “against the box,” to “lock in” or secure the value in an investment until it becomes liquid\nand freely tradable. The Fund will only sell short a stock to the extent it holds a corresponding\nlong and illiquid position in the same company.\nPortfolio Trading\nThe Fund does not generally intend to trade its assets for short-term profits, however, when\ncircumstances warrant, securities may be sold by the Fund without regard to the length of time\nheld. Any active short-term trading of the Fund will increase its rate of turnover and related\ntransaction expenses.\nNon-U.S. Investments\nThe Fund may invest a portion of Fund’s total committed capital in the securities of issuers that\nare organized outside of the U.S. and Canada. Investing in non-U.S. securities may involve\nsubstantially greater risks than investing in U.S. securities including risks relating to (i) currency\nexchange matters, including fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the\nvarious foreign currencies in which the Fund’s non-U.S. investments are denominated, and\ncosts associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency to\nanother; (ii) differences between the U.S. and non-U.S. securities markets, including potential\nprice volatility in and relative illiquidity of some non-U.S. securities markets; (iii) the absence of\nuniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and disclosure\nrequirements, and differences in government supervision and regulation; (iv) certain economic\nand political risks, including potential exchange control regulations, potential restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of capital and the risks associated with political, economic\nor social instability, diplomatic developments, and the possibility of expropriation or\n65\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nconfiscatory taxation; and (v) the possible imposition of non-U.S. taxes on income and gains\nrecognized with respect to such securities. While the General Partner will take these factors into\nconsideration in making investment decisions for the Fund and intends to manage the Fund in a\nmanner to minimize exposure to the foregoing risks, there can be no assurance that the General\nPartner will be able to evaluate the risks accurately or that adverse developments with respect\nto such risks will not adversely affect the value or realization of investments that are held by the\nFund in certain countries.\nReserves\nAs is customary in the industry, the General Partner may establish reserves for follow-on\ninvestments by the Fund in portfolio companies, operating expenses (including the\nManagement Fee), Fund liabilities, and other matters. Estimating the appropriate amount of\nsuch reserves is difficult, especially for follow-on investment opportunities, which are directly\ntied to the success and capital needs of portfolio companies. Inadequate or excessive reserves\ncould impair the investment returns to the Limited Partners. If reserves are inadequate, the\nFund may be unable to take advantage of attractive follow-on or other investment opportunities\nor to protect its existing investments from dilutive or other punitive terms associated with “payto-play”\nor similar provisions. If reserves are excessive, the Fund may decline attractive\ninvestment opportunities or hold unnecessary amounts of capital in money market or similar\nlow-yield accounts.\nDiverse Investors\nThe Limited Partners may have conflicting investment, tax, and other interests with respect to\ntheir investments in the Fund. The conflicting interests of individual Limited Partners may\nrelate to or arise from, among other things, the nature of investments made by the Fund, the\nstructuring or the acquisition of investments and the timing of disposition of investments. As a\nconsequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by the Fund\nManagers, including with respect to the nature or structuring of investments that may be more\nbeneficial for some Limited Partners than for others, particularly with respect to investors’\nindividual tax situations. In selecting and structuring investments appropriate for the Fund, the\nGeneral Partner will consider the investment and tax objective of the Fund and the Partners as a\nwhole, not the investment, tax or other objective of any Limited Partner individually.\nFailure of Limited Partners to Fulfill Their Commitment Obligations\nThe Fund’s investments in portfolio companies will require capital calls on Limited Partners\nover an extended period of time. Failure by a Limited Partner to meet a capital call could result\nin the failure of the Fund to make desired investments, which could have adverse consequences\nfor the Fund and thus all of the Limited Partners. The failure by the Fund to receive a\nsignificant portion of capital contributions due from Limited Partners in respect of their\nCommitments could materially impair the Fund’s ability to realize its financial objectives. In\nthe event that a Limited Partner defaults, such Limited Partner may be subject to various\npenalties, including forfeiture of all or a portion of its interest in the Fund, as provided in the\nPartnership Agreement.\nRisk of Dilution\nLimited Partners subscribing for interests at subsequent closings will participate in existing\ninvestments of the Fund, diluting the interest of existing Limited Partners therein. Although\nsuch Limited Partners will contribute their pro rata share of prior capital contributions\n66\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\npreviously drawn down by the Fund (plus an additional amount thereon), there can be no\nassurance that such payment will reflect the fair value of the Fund’s existing investments at the\ntime such additional Limited Partners subscribe for such interests.\nDifficulty in Valuing Portfolio Investments and Distribution in Kind\nGenerally, there will be no readily available market for a substantial number of the Fund’s\ninvestments and hence, most of the Fund’s investments will be difficult to value. The securities\nin which the Fund will invest may be among the most junior in a portfolio company’s capital\nstructure, and thus subject to the greatest risk of loss. It is highly speculative as to the whether\nand when a portfolio company will be able to register its securities so that the securities become\neligible for trading in public markets. Certain investments may be distributed in kind to the\nPartners of the Fund. An investor that receives assets other than cash from the Fund may incur\ncosts and delays in converting those assets to cash.\nNon-Controlling Investments\nThe Fund generally expects to make non-controlling investments in portfolio companies where\nthe Fund may not be able to control or effectively influence the business or affairs of such\nentities. Portfolio companies in which the Fund’s investments are made may have economic or\nbusiness interests or goals which are inconsistent with those of the Fund, and the Fund may not\nbe in a position to influence those interests or goals or otherwise protect the value of the Fund’s\ninvestments in such entities. In addition, although the Fund may seek board representation in\nconnection with its investments, there is no assurance that such representation, if sought, will\nbe obtained.\nService on Board of Directors\nThe Fund typically will seek to have observation or visitation rights or the right to designate\ndirectors to serve on the boards of directors of the Fund’s portfolio companies. In addition,\naffiliates of the General Partner may serve, from time to time, as officers or directors of the\nportfolio companies. The foregoing rights and activities could expose the General Partner, its\naffiliates and the assets of the Fund to regulatory action and/or lawsuits and claims by a\nportfolio company, its security holders and its creditors. While the General Partner intends to\nmanage the Fund in a way that will minimize exposure to these risks, the possibility of\nsuccessful claims or lawsuits or adverse regulatory action cannot be eliminated, and such events\ncould have significant adverse effects on the Fund.\nMaterial Non-Public Information\nBy reason of their responsibilities in connection with their other activities, certain affiliates of\nthe General Partner may acquire confidential or material non-public information or be\notherwise restricted from initiating transactions in certain securities. The Fund will not be free\nto act upon any such information. Due to these restrictions, the Fund may be not be able to\ninitiate a transaction that it otherwise might have initiated and may not be able to sell an\ninvestment that it might otherwise might have sold.\nIn their capacity as officers or directors, affiliates of the General Partner will be subject to\nfiduciary or other duties to the portfolio company, which may adversely affect the Fund. For\nexample, the Fund may be prohibited from selling publicly traded securities of a portfolio\ncompany if the General Partner or any of its affiliates is in possession of material non-public\ninformation relating to such company.\n67\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nRecourse to the Fund’s Assets\nThe Fund’s assets, including any investments made by the Fund and any funds held by the\nFund, are available to satisfy all liabilities and other obligations of the Fund. If the Fund\nbecomes subject to a liability, parties seeking to have the liability satisfied may have recourse to\nthe Fund’s assets generally and will not be limited to any particular assets, such as the asset\nrepresenting the investment giving rise to the liability. Accordingly, investors could find their\ninterest in the Fund’s assets adversely affected by a liability arising out of an investment of the\nFund.\nContingent Liabilities on Disposition of Investments\nIn connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company or otherwise, the\nFund may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of the\nportfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of any business. The Fund\nmay also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such portfolio company to the extent that\nany such representations turn out to be inaccurate. These arrangements may result in\ncontingent liabilities, which might ultimately have to be funded by the investors to the extent of\ntheir Commitment to the Fund or previous distributions made to them.\nCertain Litigation Risks\nThe Fund will be subject to a variety of litigation risks, particularly if one or more of its portfolio\ncompanies face financial or other difficulties during the term of the Fund. Legal disputes,\ninvolving any or all of the Fund, the General Partner, its partners or its affiliates, may arise from\nthe Fund’s activities and investments and could have a significant adverse effect on the Fund.\nIndemnification\nThe Fund will be required to indemnify, among others, the General Partner, the general partner\nof the General Partner, the Management Company, the Fund Managers, their respective\npartners, members, employees, venture partners and affiliates, the Fund’s other agents and\nmembers of the Advisory Board for liabilities incurred in connection with the affairs of the\nFund. Such liabilities may be material. For example, in their capacity as directors of portfolio\ncompanies, the partners, managers, or affiliates of the General Partner may be subject to\nderivative or other similar claims brought by security holders of such companies. The\nindemnification obligations of the Fund would be payable from the assets of the Fund,\nincluding the unused capital commitments of the Partners. If the assets of the Fund are\ninsufficient to pay such indemnification obligations, the Limited Partners may be required to\nreturn distributions previously made to them in order to satisfy such obligations.\nChanges\nThe Fund’s investment program is intended to extend over a period of years, during which the\nbusiness, economic, political, regulatory, and technology environment within which the Fund\noperates may undergo substantial changes, some of which may be adverse to the Fund. The\nGeneral Partner will have the exclusive right and authority (within limitations set forth in the\nPartnership Agreement) to determine the manner in which the Fund shall respond to such\nchanges, and Limited Partners generally will have no right to withdraw from the Fund or to\ndemand specific modifications to the Fund’s operations in consequence thereof. A major\nrecession or adverse developments in the securities or credit markets might have an impact on\nsome or all of the Fund’s investments. A sustained period of inactivity and/or low valuations\n68\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nin the public equity markets could result in substantially lower liquidation values and\nsubstantially longer periods before liquidity is achieved in comparison with historical values,\nwhich would reduce the returns that could be achieved by the Fund. In addition, factors\nspecific to a portfolio company may have an adverse effect on the Fund’s investment in such\ncompany. The General Partner may rely upon its own or a portfolio company’s projections\nconcerning the portfolio company’s future performance in making investment decisions. Such\nprojections are inherently subject to uncertainty and to certain factors beyond the control of the\nportfolio company and the General Partner. Prospective investors are particularly cautioned\nthat the investment sourcing, selection, management and liquidation strategies and procedures\nexercised by partners of the General Partner in the past may not be successful, or even\npracticable, during the Fund’s term.\nIndustry Specific Terminology\nProspective investors are cautioned that certain terms and phrases of common usage within the\nventure capital industry may be misleading to those unfamiliar with such usage. In particular,\nindividuals who participate in the management of a fund often are referred to, in a colloquial\nsense, as “general partners” even though they are not actually general partners of any\npartnership. Prospective investors are reminded that the Fund will be a limited partnership,\nthat the General Partner will be a limited partnership, that the general partner of the General\nPartner will be a limited liability company, and that the individuals directing the management\nof the Fund through the General Partner will be members of such limited liability company. It\nis not intended that the Fund will have any general partner other than the General Partner or\nthat any actual general partnership will in any manner be associated with the formation,\noperation, dissolution or termination of the Fund. Prospective investors must not presume or\nrely upon the existence of any actual legal entities other than the Fund, the General Partner and\nthe general partner of the General Partner. With respect to all matters involving industry\nspecific terminology, prospective investors are urged to consult with their own legal and other\nadvisors.\nFund and General Partner Not Registered\nThe Fund will not be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the\n“Investment Company Act”) pursuant to an exemption set forth in Sections 3(c)(1) and/or\n3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that such exemptions will\ncontinue to be available to the Fund. Due to the burdens of compliance with the Investment\nCompany Act, the performance of the Fund’s investment portfolio could be materially\nadversely affected, and risks involved in financing portfolio companies could substantially\nincrease, if the Fund becomes subject to registration under the Investment Company Act.\nNeither the Fund nor its counsel can assure investors that, under certain conditions, changed\ncircumstances, or changes in the law, the Fund may not become subject to the Investment\nCompany Act or other burdensome regulation. The General Partner is not registered as a\nbroker/dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and\nwith the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the “NASD”) and is consequently not\nsubject to the record keeping and specific business practice provisions of the Exchange Act and\nthe rules of the NASD.\n69\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nTax Risks\nCertain tax risks relating to an investment in the Fund are discussed in Section XI “Certain Tax\n& ERISA Considerations”, which prospective investors should read carefully. No assurances\ncan be given that current tax laws, rulings and regulation will not be changed during the life of\nthe Fund. Prospective Limited Partners should consult their tax advisors for further\ninformation about the tax consequences of purchasing a Limited Partner Interest in the Fund.\nWithholding and Other Taxes\nThe General Partner intends to structure the Fund’s investments in a manner that is intended to\nachieve the Fund’s investment objectives and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the\ncontrary, there can be no assurance that the structure of any investment will be tax efficient for\nany particular investor or that any particular tax result will be achieved. In addition, tax\nreporting requirements may be imposed on investors under the laws of the jurisdictions in\nwhich investors are liable to taxation or in which the Fund makes portfolio investments.\nProspective investors should consult their own professional advisors with respect to the tax\nconsequences to them of an investment in the Fund under the laws of the jurisdiction in which\nthey are liable to taxation. Furthermore, the Fund’s returns in respect of its investments may be\nreduced by withholding or other taxes imposed by jurisdictions in which the Fund’s portfolio\ncompanies are organized.\nConfidential Information\nThe Partnership Agreement will contain confidentiality provisions intended to protect\nproprietary and other information relating to the Fund and the Fund’s portfolio companies. To\nthe extent that such information is publicly disclosed, competitors of the Fund and/or\ncompetitors of its portfolio companies, and others, may benefit from such information, thereby\nadversely affecting the Fund, its portfolio companies and the General Partner and the economic\ninterests of Limited Partners.\nWritten Agreements\nThe Fund, the General Partner and the Management Company will be authorized, without the\napproval of any Limited Partner, to enter into side letters or similar written agreements with\nLimited Partners that have the effect of establishing rights under, or altering or supplementing\nthe terms of this Memorandum, the Partnership Agreement, such Limited Partner’s\nSubscription Agreement or other related agreements. The ability of other Limited Partners to\nreceive copies of and/or elect to receive the benefit of such side agreements will be limited.\nMarket volatility\nSince 2008, the capital, credit and securities markets have been experiencing unprecedented\nlevels of volatility and disruption. Ongoing volatility could negatively impact the Fund in a\nnumber of ways. Many of the investments purchased, held and sold on behalf of the Fund may\nbe complex, and their market values will be highly sensitive to market changes. Overall Fund\nreturns may be reduced as relatively small changes in the capital, credit or securities markets\nmay have significant impacts on the profitability of Fund investments. In addition, the U.S.\nCongress and regulatory agencies may adopt new financial regulations and tax policies in\nresponse to continued volatility, which could restrict the Fund’s investment options and be\notherwise unfavorable to the Fund.\n70\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nRegulatory Changes\nOn June 22, 2011, to implement provisions of Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) adopted\nfinal rules implementing new exemptions from the registration requirements of the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”), one of which is commonly known as the venture\ncapital fund exemption. Neither the General Partner nor the Management Company is currently\nexpected to register as an investment adviser with the SEC in reliance on the venture capital\nfund exemption. The General Partner may need to take into consideration certain conditions\nregarding the nature of investments that may be made by investment vehicles advised by an\ninvestment adviser relying on the venture capital exemption, which may constrain the Fund’s\ninvestment flexibility or require certain non-qualifying investments to be disposed of earlier\nthan they might otherwise be. In addition, compliance with the venture capital fund exemption\nmay subject the Fund to limitations on the Fund’s operations, including limitations on the\nFund’s ability to borrow, provide guarantees and make short-term investments that are more\nrestrictive than any limitation set forth in the Partnership Agreement.\nReliance on the venture capital exemption also will necessitate reporting certain information to\nthe SEC about the Management Company, the General Partner and their affiliates and may\nresult in such entities being subject to SEC examination authority and certain Advisers Act\ncompliance obligations. If the General Partner and the Management Company are able to rely\non the venture capital exemption, investors in the Fund will not be entitled to the benefits of\ncertain protections under the Advisers Act. If the General Partner or the Management Company\ncannot rely on the venture capital exemption, the General Partner or the Management Company\nmay need to register as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Registration under, and\ncompliance with, the Advisers Act could be costly and could divert attention of the Fund’s\nmanagement team. There also can be no assurance that statutory, regulatory, judicial or\nadministrative interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not in the future impose\nmore comprehensive or stringent requirements on the General Partner or the Management\nCompany.\nCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Certain information\ncontained in this Memorandum constitutes “forward-looking statements,” which can be\nidentified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,”\n“anticipate,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend,” “continue,” or “believe,” or the negatives thereof\nor other variations thereon or comparable terminology. Such forward-looking statements,\nincluding the intended actions and performance objectives for the Fund, involve known and\nunknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results,\nperformance or achievements of the Fund to differ materially from any future results,\nperformance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nAlthough this information was prepared by the General Partner based on its experience in the\nindustry and on assumptions of fact and opinion as to future events that the General Partner\nbelieved to be reasonable when made, no representation is made or assurance given that such\nstatements, views, projections or forecasts are correct or that the objectives of the Fund will be\nachieved or that investors will receive a return of their capital. Moreover, neither the Fund nor\nthe General Partner, nor any of their affiliates, assumes responsibility for the accuracy and\ncompleteness of any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements in this\nMemorandum speak only as of the date of this Memorandum. The Fund, the General Partner\nand their affiliates expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates\n71\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nor revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in its\nexpectation with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which\nany such statement is based. Due to various risks and uncertainties, actual events or results or\nthe actual performance of the Fund may differ materially from those reflected or contemplated\nin such forward-looking statements. Limited Partners are cautioned not to place undue reliance\non such statements.\nTHE FOREGOING LIST OF RISK FACTORS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST DOES NOT\nPURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE EXPLANATION OF THE RISKS INVOLVED IN THIS\nOFFERING. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO READ THIS ENTIRE\nMEMORANDUM BEFORE DETERMINING TO INVEST IN THE FUND.\n72\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nX. CERTAIN TAX AND ERISA CONSIDERATIONS\nIN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. TREASURY REGULATIONS GOVERNING PRACTICE\nBEFORE THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (CIRCULAR 230), LEGAL COUNSEL TO\nTHE FUND HEREBY INFORMS INVESTORS THAT (A) THE INFORMATION BELOW\n(OR OTHERWISE CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT) IS NOT INTENDED OR\nWRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, BY THE INVESTORS FOR THE\nPURPOSE OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (THE\n“IRS”) MAY ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE ON AN INVESTOR, (B) THE INFORMATION WAS\nWRITTEN TO SUPPORT THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING OF THE TRANSACTION\nOR MATTERS ADDRESSED BY THE WRITTEN INFORMATION, AND (C) INVESTORS\nSHOULD SEEK TAX ADVICE BASED ON THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES\nFROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR.\nCERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\nThe following is a brief summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be\nrelevant to an investment in the Fund. This summary does not contain a comprehensive\ndiscussion of all U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a Partner in view\nof that Partner’s particular circumstances or (unless otherwise indicated) to certain Partners\nsubject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws — such as regulated investment\ncompanies, personal holding companies, brokers or dealers in securities, banks and certain\nother financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, trusts, and insurance companies — nor\ndoes it address any state, estate, local, foreign, or other tax consequences of an investment in the\nFund, except as otherwise provided herein. This summary is based on the assumptions that (i)\neach Partner (and each of its beneficial owners, as necessary under U.S. federal income tax\nwithholding and backup withholding rules) will provide all appropriate certifications to the\nFund in a timely fashion to minimize withholding (or backup withholding) on each Partner’s\ndistributive share of the Fund’s gross income and (ii) each Partner will hold its Limited Partner\nInterest in the Fund as a capital asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each prospective\ninvestor should also note that, except as otherwise provided herein, this summary does not\naddress the interaction of U.S. federal tax laws and any income or estate tax treaties between the\nU.S. and any other jurisdiction.\nNo assurance can be given that the IRS will concur with the tax consequences set forth below.\nEach prospective investor is advised to consult its own tax counsel as to the specific U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of an investment in the Fund and as to applicable foreign,\nstate, estate, and local taxes.\nGeneral Matters\nClassification of the Fund - Pursuant to applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, the Fund will be\ntreated as a partnership, rather than a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless\nthe Fund affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation for such purposes. The General\nPartner has no intention of making such an election on behalf of the Fund and does not\nanticipate any circumstances under which such an election would be made. In certain cases\nunder Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), a\npartnership that is classified as a “publicly traded partnership” may be taxed as a corporation\n73\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes. The following discussion is based on the assumption that\nthe Fund will not be treated as a “publicly traded partnership.”\nTreatment of U.S. Partners and Non-U.S. Partners - The discussion below addresses separately\ncertain U.S. federal income tax matters relevant to U.S. Partners and Non-U.S. Partners. For\npurposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. person” generally means any U.S. citizen or resident\nindividual, any corporation, limited liability company, or partnership organized under U.S. law,\nany estate (other than an estate the income of which, from sources outside the U.S. that is not\neffectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S., is not includible in its gross\nincome for U.S. federal income tax purposes), and any trust if a court within the U.S. is able to\nexercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons\nhave the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. The term “U.S. Partner”\nmeans any partner that is a U.S. person and, unless the context otherwise requires, includes any\nU.S. person that holds an equity interest in the Fund through one or more partnerships or other\nentities treated as transparent for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The term “Non-U.S.\nPartner” means a Partner that is not a U.S. person.\nTaxation of Fund Operations Generally - As a partnership, the Fund will not pay U.S. federal\nincome taxes, but each U.S. Partner will be required to report that Partner’s distributive share\n(whether or not distributed) of the Fund’s income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of the\ncharacter specified in Section 702 of the Code. It is possible that the U.S. Partners could incur\nU.S. federal income tax liabilities without receiving from the Fund sufficient distributions to\ndefray such tax liabilities. The Fund’s taxable year will be the calendar year, or such other\nperiod as required by the Code. Tax information will be delivered to all Partners on an annual\nbasis to enable the Partners to complete their tax returns.\nElection to Adjust Basis of Fund Assets - Under the principal agreements relating to the Fund\nand Section 754 of the Code, the General Partner will have the authority to elect to adjust the\nbasis of the Fund’s assets (commonly referred to as “Section 754 adjustments”) in connection\nwith certain distributions made by the Fund to Partners or certain transfers of Limited Partner\nInterests in the Fund. Although the General Partner has no present intention of making an\nelection on behalf of the Fund under Section 754 of the Code, Section 754 adjustments may\nnevertheless be mandatory under certain circumstances and could affect the amount of a\nPartner’s allocations (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of gain or loss recognized by the\nFund on a disposition of its assets.\nThe General Partner also will have the authority under the principal agreements relating to the\nFund to elect to treat the Fund as an “electing investment partnership” and, as a result,\npotentially avoid making Section 754 adjustments that otherwise would be mandatory with\nrespect to certain transfers of Limited Partner Interests in the Fund. Such election, however,\nmay result in the disallowance (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of certain losses allocated\nby the Fund to transferees of Limited Partner Interests in the Fund. It is possible, however, that\nthe Fund will not be able to qualify as an electing investment partnership.\nThe General Partner will have the authority to require any Partner engaging in a transaction\nthat requires a Section 754 adjustment (for example, a transfer of the Partner’s Limited Partner\nInterest) to bear the ongoing administrative and other costs incurred by the Fund or its Partners\nin connection with these basis adjustment rules. These costs, which could be significant, may be\n74\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\ncharged to a Partner without regard to whether the General Partner made either of the elections\ndescribed above on behalf of the Fund. Furthermore, each Partner will be required to provide\nthe Fund with any information necessary to allow the Fund to comply with its obligations to\nmake Section 754 adjustments and/or its obligations as an electing investment partnership.\nTax-Exempt U.S. Partners\nUnrelated Business Taxable Income - Under the terms of the principal agreements relating to\nthe Fund, the General Partner will be required to use reasonable best efforts to conduct the\naffairs of the Fund in a manner that does not cause any tax-exempt U.S. Partner to recognize\nany “unrelated business taxable income” within the meaning of Section 512 of the Code;\nprovided, however, that the General Partner may cause the Fund to borrow on a short-term\nbasis and may guarantee the indebtedness of any portfolio company. The General Partner’s\nundertaking will be deemed satisfied with respect to the making, holding or disposing of any\nportfolio investment if the tax-exempt U.S. Partners are given the opportunity to (or if all\nLimited Partners are otherwise required to) hold their proportionate shares of such portfolio\ninvestment directly or indirectly through an alternative investment vehicle treated as a\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Notwithstanding this undertaking, it is\npossible that the Fund could realize income which would constitute unrelated business taxable\nincome, and in that event each tax-exempt U.S. Partner would be subject to U.S. federal income\ntax on its share of such income and may be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return with\nrespect to such income.\nTaxable U.S. Partners\nLimitations on Allowable Deductions - Under Section 67 of the Code, U.S. taxpayers who are\nindividuals may deduct certain miscellaneous expenses (e.g., investment advisory fees, tax\npreparation fees, and unreimbursed employee expenses such as the cost of subscriptions to\nprofessional journals) only to the extent that these deductions exceed, in the aggregate, 2% of\nthe taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. Further, Section 68 of the Code disallows certain\ndeductions otherwise allowable to taxpayers who are individuals; the amount disallowed varies\nbased on the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. Part or all of the Fund’s expenses allocated to\nany U.S. Partner who is an individual (including that Partner’s share of the management fee\npayable to the Fund’s Management Company) may be disallowed under these provisions,\nalthough tax-exempt U.S. Partners will generally not be affected. Finally, certain expenses\n(including the fees and expenses of placement agents, if any) incurred in connection with the\noffer and sale of the Limited Partner Interests are not deductible by any U.S. Partner. If the\nManagement Company or an affiliate pays the fees or expenses of any placement agent, a\ncorresponding portion of the Fund’s expenses attributable to payments or accruals of the\nmanagement fee is likely to constitute a nondeductible syndication expense.\nSurtax on Unearned Income - Section 1411 of the Code generally imposes a 3.8% surtax on the\n“net investment income” of certain U.S. Partners who are citizens or resident aliens, and on the\nundistributed “net investment income” of certain U.S. estates and trusts. Among other items,\n“net investment income” generally would include a U.S. Partner’s allocable share of the Fund’s\nnet gains and certain other income such as interest and dividends, less deductions allocable to\nsuch income. In addition, “net investment income” may include gain from the sale, exchange or\nother taxable disposition of an interest in the Fund, less certain deductions. U.S. Partners\n75\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\npotentially subject to the surtax should consult their own advisors concerning its potential\napplicability to their individual circumstances.\nPassive Foreign Investment Companies - A portfolio investment by the Fund in a non-U.S.\ncorporation that is classified as a “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) will cause\ntaxable U.S. Partners to be subject to taxation under Sections 1291 through 1298 of the Code. In\ngeneral, a non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC if 75% or more of its gross income\nconstitutes “passive income” — generally, interest, dividends, royalties, rent and similar\nincome, and gains on the disposition of assets that generate such income — or 50% or more of\nits assets (by value or, in certain situations, by adjusted tax bases) produce passive income or\nare held for the production of such income. Under the PFIC rules, gain attributable to a\ndisposition of PFIC stock, as well as income attributable to certain “excess distributions” with\nrespect to that PFIC stock, is allocated ratably over the shareholder’s holding period for the\nstock. Gain allocated under this rule to (i) the year in which the shareholder disposes of the\nPFIC stock and (ii) any year prior to the time the foreign corporation first satisfied the PFIC\nincome or assets test, as well as income attributable to any excess distribution on PFIC stock\nallocated to those years, is subject to tax (as ordinary income) at the U.S. federal income tax\nrates applicable to the shareholder for the year in which the disposition occurs. Disposition\ngain attributable to years included in the shareholder’s holding period — other than those\ndescribed in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) — and income attributable to excess distributions\nallocated to each such other year is subject to tax (as ordinary income) at the maximum U.S.\nfederal income tax rate applicable to the shareholder for the year in which the income is treated\nas realized, and also to an interest-like charge on the shareholder’s “deferred” payment of this\ntax liability that accrues generally from the year of deemed realization through the due date of\nthe shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax return for the year of disposition or distribution\n(determined without regard to extensions). A U.S. Partner effectively will be treated as a U.S.\nshareholder with respect to its proportionate share of any PFIC stock owned by the Fund. If,\nhowever, that PFIC is also a “controlled foreign corporation” in which the Fund is a “United\nStates Shareholder” (as defined below), the PFIC rules generally will be superseded by the rules\ndiscussed below dealing with controlled foreign corporations. The PFIC rules generally should\nnot affect tax-exempt U.S. Partners.\nThe PFIC rules are highly technical and it is possible that a non-U.S. corporation in which the\nFund makes an investment will be classified as a PFIC. If the Fund invests in the stock of a\nportfolio company classified as a PFIC, and that company agrees to provide the Fund and, if\nnecessary, the IRS with certain financial information, the Fund may elect to treat that company\nas a “qualified electing fund” (“QEF”). If the Fund holds stock of a non-U.S. corporation with\nrespect to which a QEF election has been made for the first taxable year in the Fund’s holding\nperiod for which the non U.S. corporation is a PFIC, each U.S. Partner will be subject to tax\ncurrently on its proportionate share of certain earnings and net capital gain of that non-U.S.\ncorporation — regardless of whether that corporation actually distributes cash or other property\nto the Fund — but generally will not be subject to the tax regime described in the preceding\nparagraph with respect to its investment in that corporation. Although the maximum rate of\ntax imposed on certain dividends is currently 20%, this rate does not apply to dividends paid or\ndeemed paid by PFICs. A QEF election generally will not result in current inclusion of the\nPFIC’s earnings for any year in which the PFIC has no net ordinary earnings and no net capital\ngain. Alternatively, if such PFIC stock is publicly traded, the Fund may be eligible to value the\n76\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nstock annually on a “mark-to-market” basis so that the Fund may treat any resulting gain or\nloss as ordinary income or loss to avoid the PFIC tax.\nAs noted above, the PFIC rules (including the rules pertaining to QEF elections) generally\nshould not affect tax-exempt U.S. Partners.\nThe Fund cannot predict with any certainty at this time whether any non-U.S. portfolio\ncompany in which the Fund invests may be subject to the PFIC regime, whether a timely QEF\nelection can or will be made, or the effect or availability of any applicable elections made by the\nFund. The rules applicable to PFICs are complex, and the foregoing summary of U.S. federal\nincome taxation of U.S. Partners indirectly owning an interest in a PFIC is general in nature. It\nis possible that U.S. Partners may be subject to tax currently under the PFIC regime on their\nproportionate shares of certain earnings of a non-U.S. corporation in which the Fund holds an\ninterest and/or may incur nondeductible interest-like charges on tax liability deferred under the\nPFIC regime without receiving from the Fund distributions sufficient to satisfy any such\nobligations.\nIn addition to the PFIC rules discussed above, a U.S. person that is a shareholder of a PFIC may\nbe required to file an annual information report and/or applicable tax forms with the IRS.\nControlled Foreign Corporations - Under Sections 951 through 957 of the Code, special rules\napply to U.S. persons who own, directly or indirectly and applying certain attribution rules,\n10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a non-U.S. corporation\n(each, a “United States Shareholder”) that is a “controlled foreign corporation” (“CFC”). For\nthis purpose, the Fund will be treated as a United States Shareholder of any foreign corporation\nin which the Fund’s share ownership reaches this 10% threshold. A non-U.S. corporation\ngenerally will be a CFC for a taxable year if United States Shareholders collectively own more\nthan 50% of the total combined voting power or total value of the corporation’s stock on any\nday during such taxable year. United States Shareholders of a CFC generally must include in\ntheir gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes their pro rata shares of certain earnings\nand profits of the CFC. Further, under Section 1248 of the Code, if a U.S. person sells or\nexchanges stock of a non-U.S. corporation and that person is or was a United States Shareholder\nat any time during the five-year period ending on the date of such sale or exchange during\nwhich that non-U.S. corporation was a CFC, that U.S. person generally will be required to treat\na portion of the gain recognized upon such sale or exchange as a dividend to the extent of the\nearnings and profits of the CFC attributable to such stock. Under U.S. federal income tax rules,\nthe Fund itself is a U.S. person and, if the Fund becomes a United States Shareholder of a CFC,\ntaxable U.S. Partners (i) will be required to report and pay tax currently on their shares of the\nCFC’s earnings and profits attributable to the Fund that are taxable to its United States\nShareholders under the CFC rules, and (ii) will be subject to the Section 1248 recharacterization\nrule described above. In addition, if the Fund is a United States Shareholder of a CFC and a\nU.S. Partner disposes of its Limited Partner Interest, that Partner generally will recognize\nincome under Section 751 of the Code equal to its distributive share of the Section 1248 income\nthat would have been triggered if the Fund had sold its interest in the CFC at fair market value.\nThe maximum rate of tax imposed on certain dividend income and certain long-term capital\ngains attributable to dispositions of securities generally is 20%, so that a recharacterization of\ngain under Section 1248 might not increase that U.S. Partner’s U.S. federal income tax liability.\nIn addition, income of a CFC subject to income tax in a country other than the U.S. at an\n77\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\neffective rate greater than 90% of the maximum U.S. corporate income tax rate is not taxable to a\nUnited States Shareholder under the CFC rules if the United States Shareholder so elects.\nThe rules applicable to CFCs are complex, and the foregoing summary of the U.S. federal\nincome taxation of U.S. Partners indirectly owning an interest in a CFC is general in nature. The\nGeneral Partner cannot provide any assurance that the Fund’s portfolio companies will not be\nCFCs. The CFC rules, however, generally should not affect tax-exempt U.S. Partners.\nU.S. Foreign Tax Credits - The Fund may make investments in entities that are formed and\noperating under the laws of countries other than the United States. The countries in which these\nentities are organized and operate may impose taxes on the income of, and distributions or\nother payments made by, these entities. In addition, the Fund and/or the Partners may be\nrequired to file tax or information returns in such non-U.S. jurisdictions. U.S. Partners may be\nentitled, under certain circumstances, to a reduced rate of non-U.S. tax on their shares of such\nincome or distributions under tax treaties between the United States and the non-U.S.\njurisdictions imposing such tax, or may, in certain circumstances, be entitled under such treaties\nto file tax returns in such jurisdictions and claim refunds of any amounts of non-U.S. tax overwithheld.\nSubject to applicable limitations on foreign tax credits, a U.S. Partner that is subject to U.S.\nfederal income taxation generally should be entitled to elect to treat foreign taxes withheld from\nsuch Partner’s share of the Fund’s dividend and interest income as foreign income taxes eligible\nfor credit against such Partner’s U.S. federal income tax liability. Similarly, each U.S. Partner’s\nshare of any foreign taxes which may be imposed on capital gains or other income realized by\nthe Fund generally should be treated as creditable foreign income taxes. Capital gains realized\nby the Fund, however, may be considered to be from sources within the U.S., which may\neffectively limit the amount of foreign tax credit allowed to the U.S. Partner. Other complex tax\nrules may also limit the availability or use of foreign tax credits, depending on each U.S.\nPartner’s particular circumstances. Because of these limitations, U.S. Partners may be unable to\nclaim a credit for the full amount of their proportionate shares of any foreign taxes paid by the\nFund. U.S. Partners that do not elect to treat their shares of foreign taxes as creditable generally\nmay claim a deduction against U.S. taxable income for such taxes (subject to applicable\nlimitations on losses and deductions). Foreign tax credits or deductions generally will not\nprovide any benefit to tax-exempt U.S. Partners unless such Partners’ distributive shares of the\nincome or gains on which the related foreign income taxes are imposed constitute “unrelated\nbusiness taxable income” and certain other conditions are satisfied. However, since the\navailability of a credit or deduction depends on the particular circumstances of each U.S.\nPartner, Partners are advised to consult their own tax advisors.\nForeign Currency Issues - A U.S. Partner’s distributive share of profits or losses realized by the\nFund on the conversion of U.S. dollars into non-U.S. currency, or of non-U.S. currency into U.S.\ndollars, generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss rather than capital gain or loss.\nFurther, if the Fund acquires, or becomes the obligor under, a debt instrument or enters into\ncertain other transactions, any of which is denominated in terms of a currency other than the\nU.S. dollar, fluctuations in the value of that currency relative to the U.S. dollar generally will\nresult in foreign currency gain or loss realized by the Fund and will be included in the U.S.\nPartners’ distributive shares of Fund profits or losses as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss\nrather than capital gain or loss.\n78\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nU.S. Reporting by U.S. Partners That Are Owners of Non-U.S. Entities - U.S. tax rules impose\ninformation reporting requirements on U.S. persons that own, either directly or indirectly under\nstock attribution rules, more than certain threshold amounts of stock in a foreign corporation;\nthese persons must disclose, among other things, various transactions between themselves and\nthose foreign corporations. For purposes of these information reporting requirements, stock\nownership is determined with regard to certain stock attribution rules, and each U.S. Partner is\ntreated as owning part or all of the stock owned directly or indirectly by the Fund. Similar\nreporting requirements apply to United States persons that (i) own, directly or indirectly, more\nthan certain threshold amounts of certain foreign financial assets including, but not limited to\nstocks, securities and partnership interests in non-U.S. entities or (ii) contribute, in their capacity\nas Partners, more than a certain threshold amount to a non-U.S. partnership during a 12-month\nperiod. In certain circumstances, these rules may require U.S. Partners to file reports annually.\nU.S. Partners generally will be responsible for satisfying these information reporting\nrequirements.\nNon-U.S. Partners\nU.S. Trade or Business Issues - Under the terms of the principal agreements relating to the\nFund, the General Partner will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct\nthe affairs of the Fund in a manner that limits the Fund’s operations to investing and other\nrelated activities which, in the aggregate, would not cause the Fund to be treated as engaged in\nthe conduct of a trade or business in the U.S. The General Partner’s undertaking will be\ndeemed satisfied with respect to the making, holding or disposing of any portfolio investment if\nthe Non-U.S. Partners are given the opportunity to (or if all Limited Partners are otherwise\nrequired to) hold their proportionate shares of such portfolio investment directly or indirectly\nthrough an alternative investment vehicle treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Notwithstanding this undertaking, it is possible that the activities of the Fund and\nthe contractual arrangements into which it enters could cause the Fund to be treated as engaged\nin the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S.\nProvided that the Fund is not engaged in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the U.S.\nfederal income tax liability of a Non-U.S. Partner with respect to that Partner’s Limited Partner\nInterest generally will be limited to withholding tax on certain gross income from U.S. sources\ngenerated by the Fund as long as the Non-U.S. Partner undertakes no activities in the U.S.\n(determined without regard to its investment in the Fund) that would cause that Partner to be\nengaged in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, and, unless otherwise indicated, the\nfollowing discussion of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of Non-U.S. Partners is based on\nthat assumption.\nFurther, if the Fund withholds and remits the proper amounts to the U.S. government, Non-U.S.\nPartners that are individuals or corporations will not be required to file U.S. federal income tax\nreturns or pay additional U.S. federal income taxes solely as a result of their investment in the\nFund (though Non-U.S. Partners treated as trusts for U.S. federal income tax purposes are\nsubject to special rules). If the Fund is not engaged in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business,\nNon-U.S. Partners’ shares of income and gains from sources other than the U.S. (e.g., interest or\ndividends paid by non-U.S. portfolio companies and gains realized on the disposition of\nsecurities of those companies) will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax.\n79\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nIf it were ultimately established that the Fund is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, the Fund\ngenerally would be required to withhold and remit to the U.S. government a percentage of the\nFund’s net income and gains that are both effectively connected with that trade or business and\nallocated to Non-U.S. Partners, and would be liable for interest and penalties with respect to\namounts which were not so withheld. The relevant withholding percentage is the maximum\nU.S. federal income tax rate for individuals or corporations, as applicable. In addition, Non-U.S.\nPartners generally would be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns and pay tax in\nrespect of their shares of the Fund’s effectively connected income including capital gains, but\nwould be allowed a credit against U.S. federal income tax liability for amounts withheld by the\nFund on their behalf. Non-U.S. Partners which are non-U.S. corporations might also be subject\nto a “branch profits” tax on certain earnings of the Fund deemed to have been repatriated to\nthose Partners.\nTreatment of Interest and Dividends from U.S. Sources - Certain categories of investment\nincome from U.S. sources realized by the Fund, such as dividends and interest, generally will be\nsubject to U.S. income tax withholding, at a 30% rate on the gross amount of that income, when\nincluded in the distributive shares of Non-U.S. Partners. A Non-U.S. Partner whose distributive\nshare of such income is subject to U.S. withholding tax may be able to claim an exemption or a\nreduced rate of withholding under a tax treaty or convention between the U.S. and that\nPartner’s country of residence by providing appropriate documentation regarding that\nPartner’s residence for tax purposes and its satisfaction of any conditions imposed by the treaty.\nA Non-U.S. Partner resident in a jurisdiction with which the U.S. has a tax treaty, however, will\nnot be entitled to the benefits of that treaty with respect to that Non-U.S. Partner’s distributive\nshare of the Fund’s income and gains unless the Fund is treated as fiscally transparent under\nthe law of that non-U.S. jurisdiction and certain other conditions are satisfied. Finally, in order\nto claim the benefits of a tax treaty to reduce U.S. withholding tax on U.S.-source interest and\ndividends paid by corporations that are not actively traded, a Non-U.S. Partner — and any\ndirect or indirect equity owner of a Non-U.S. Partner seeking treaty benefits for itself because\nthe Non-U.S. Partner is considered fiscally transparent in that equity owner’s jurisdiction —\ngenerally will be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number from the IRS and may\nbe required to provide that number and certain other documentation to the Fund. Other\nexemptions may be available for certain types of interest income.\nTreatment of the Fund’s Capital Gains from U.S. Sources - Under current U.S. law, in general,\ncapital gains attributable to sales by the Fund of the securities of U.S. corporations will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income taxation or tax withholding when allocated to a Non-U.S. Partner\nunless that Partner is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the\ntaxable year in which such gains are realized and certain other conditions are satisfied.\nThis general rule does not apply to gains attributable to a U.S. trade or business or gains\nattributable to dispositions of securities of any “United States real property holding\ncorporation” (“USRPHC”), defined in Section 897 of the Code as, in general, a company with\n50% or more of the fair market value of its business assets consisting of interests in U.S. real\nestate and related assets. Capital gains attributable to sales by the Fund of the securities of a\nU.S. corporation that is a USRPHC (other than debt securities with no equity component) may\nbe subject to U.S. income tax, collected initially by withholding, to the extent allocated to any\nNon-U.S. Partner. Non-U.S. Partners would also be required to file U.S. federal income tax\n80\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nreturns, and might be liable for U.S. tax in excess of the amount collected by withholding.\nSimilarly, Non-U.S. Partners could become subject to U.S. federal income tax and tax return\nfiling obligations, as a result of transfers of their Limited Partner Interests at a time when the\nFund owned stock of any U.S. corporation that is a USRPHC, although certain exceptions may\napply. Even if a company in which the Fund invests is not a USRPHC at the time of such\ninvestment, such company subsequently may become a USRPHC.\nCurrency Conversion Issues - Non-U.S. Partners (like other Partners) will be required to make\ntheir capital contributions to the Fund in U.S. dollars, and any cash distributions made by the\nFund will be made in U.S. dollars. Profits or losses realized by Non-U.S. Partners on the\nconversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars, or of U.S. dollars into other currencies, will\nneither be reflected in the capital accounts of the Partners nor affect the amounts distributable\nby the Fund to its Non-U.S. Partners.\nWithholding on Payments to Certain Foreign Entities - Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code\nwould generally impose a withholding tax of 30% on certain gross amounts of income not\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or business paid to certain foreign entities, unless certain\nrequirements are satisfied. Amounts subject to withholding tax under these rules generally\ninclude gross U.S.-source dividend and interest income paid on or after July 1, 2014, as well as\ngross proceeds from the sale of property that produces U.S.-source dividend or interest income\npaid on or after January 1, 2017. To avoid withholding under these rules, Non-U.S. Partners\nthat are subject to these rules will generally be obligated to comply with certain information\nreporting and disclosure requirements, including, in certain cases, entering into an agreement\nwith the IRS. Non-U.S. Partners are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the\npossible application of Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code to their investment in the Fund.\nOther Tax Matters\nCertain State and Local Tax Consequences - State and local taxing jurisdictions may impose\nincome taxes and estate, inheritance and intangible property taxes on income from, or an\ninvestment in, the Fund. These tax laws may differ substantially from the U.S. federal tax laws.\nAs a result of participating in the Fund, a Partner may be required to file tax returns with, and\npay taxes to, any state or local jurisdiction in which the Fund does business (or is deemed to do\nbusiness from investing a portion of its commitments in operating businesses treated as tax\ntransparent for U.S. federal income tax purposes). A Partner’s distributive share of the Fund’s\ntaxable income, gain, loss, deduction and credit is normally included in the income reported to\nthe state and local jurisdiction(s) in which the Partner is a resident or does business. Investors\nshould consult their own tax advisors about state and local taxes.\nBasis for Description of Tax Consequences - The description of U.S. tax consequences set forth\nabove is based on the provisions of the principal agreements relating to the Fund that the\nGeneral Partner expects will be adopted, existing provisions of the Code, existing and proposed\nU.S. Treasury Regulations, existing administrative interpretations and court decisions, and\ncertain assumptions. Future legislation, U.S. Treasury Regulations, administrative\ninterpretations or court decisions could significantly change these authorities. Any such change\ncould have retroactive application and therefore could apply to transactions that have taken\nplace before such change occurs. In addition, some of the issues discussed above have not been\naddressed by administrative authorities or resolved by the courts. Accordingly, no assurance\n81\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\ncan be given that the IRS will agree with the description of the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences described above. No rulings have been or will be requested from the IRS.\nFurthermore, any changes in the principal agreements relating to the Fund or the operations of\nthe Fund could affect the tax consequences described above.\nConsultation with Tax Advisors - The description of U.S. tax matters set forth above is not\nintended as a substitute for careful tax planning. It does not address all of the U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences to investors in the Fund, and does not address any of the foreign,\nstate, local, estate or other tax consequences of such investment to any investor, except as\notherwise specifically provided. Each prospective investor in the Fund is solely responsible for\nall tax consequences to that person or entity of an investment in the Fund. Each prospective\ninvestor is advised to consult its own tax counsel as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences\nattributable to acquiring, holding and disposing of an Limited Partner Interest and as to\napplicable foreign, state, local, estate or other taxes. The effect of existing U.S. income tax laws\nand treaties, the tax laws of other jurisdictions to which an investor may be subject, and possible\nchanges in such laws and treaties (including proposed changes which have not yet been\nadopted) will vary with the particular circumstances of each investor.\nCERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS\nERISA governs the investment of assets of ERISA Plans that may be investors, directly or\nindirectly, in the Fund. ERISA, the regulations under ERISA issued by the United States\nDepartment of Labor (the “DOL”) and opinions and other authority issued by the DOL and the\ncourts provide guidance that should be considered by fiduciaries of ERISA Plans prior to\ninvesting in the Fund.\nThe following discussion of certain ERISA considerations is based on statutory authority and\njudicial and administrative interpretations as of the date hereof and is designed only to provide\na general understanding of the basic issues. Accordingly, this discussion should not be\nconsidered legal advice and the trustees and other fiduciaries of each ERISA Plan are\nencouraged to consult their own legal advisors on these matters.\nFiduciary Duty of Investing Plans\nA fiduciary considering investing assets of an Employee Plan (“plan assets”) in the Fund should\nconsult its legal adviser before making such an investment. Before authorizing an investment in\nthe Fund, any such fiduciary should, after considering the Employee Plan’s particular\ncircumstances, be satisfied that the investment of such plan assets in the Fund is appropriate\nunder the fiduciary standards of ERISA, including standards with respect to prudence,\ndiversification and compliance with the governing documents of the Employee Plan and its\nrelated trust and the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code.\nPlan Assets\nERISA and the regulation issued by the DOL at 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-101, as modified or deemed to\nbe modified by ERISA (the “Plan Assets Regulation”), define the term “plan assets” as applied\nto entities in which a plan invests, directly or indirectly, such as the Fund. The Plan Assets\nRegulation provides that when an ERISA Plan acquires an equity interest in an entity, and such\n82\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nequity interest is neither a publicly offered security nor a security issued by an investment\ncompany registered under the Investment Company Act, the assets of the ERISA Plan include\nnot only the equity interest, but also include an undivided interest in the underlying assets of\nthe entity, unless an exception to this general rule applies.\nExceptions Under the Plan Assets Regulation\nThe Plan Assets Regulation provides several exceptions to the general rule of plan asset\ntreatment. Pursuant to one such exception, the assets of certain entities, such as the Fund, will\nnot be treated as plan assets if the entity is operated as a “venture capital operating company”\nwithin the meaning of the Plan Assets Regulation (“VCOC”). Generally, for an entity to qualify\nas a VCOC, at least fifty percent (50%) of its assets (excluding short-term investments made\npending long-term commitments or distribution to investors) valued at cost must be invested in\n(a) “operating companies” with respect to which the entity has the direct contractual right to\nparticipate substantially in, or to substantially influence the conduct of, the management of the\noperating company and the entity must actually exercise such management rights with respect\nto one or more such operating companies in the ordinary course of its business, or (b)\n“derivative investments” (as defined in the Plan Assets Regulation) (the “Asset Test”). For the\npurposes of qualifying as a VCOC, an “operating company” is defined as an entity that is\nprimarily engaged, directly or through a majority owned subsidiary or subsidiaries, in the\nproduction or sale of a product or service other than the investment of capital, and includes a\n“real estate operating company” as defined in the Plan Assets Regulation (but does not include\nanother VCOC). Determination as to whether an entity qualifies as a VCOC is made at the time\nwhen the entity makes its first long-term investment (other than short-term investments made\npending long-term commitments) and thereafter during a ninety-day annual valuation period\neach year, the first day of which shall begin no later than the anniversary of the entity’s first\nlong-term investment. In order for an entity to continue to qualify as a VCOC, the entity must\nmeet the Asset Test on at least one day during each such ninety-day annual valuation period.\nSpecial rules apply to any wind-up of a VCOC when it enters its “distribution period” as\ndefined in the Plan Assets Regulation.\nAn additional exception applies when equity participation in the entity by benefit plan\ninvestors is not “significant.” Equity participation in an entity by “benefit plan investors” (as\ndefined in Section 3(42) of ERISA) is “significant” on any date if, immediately after the most\nrecent acquisition or disposition of any equity interest in the entity, 25% or more of the value (in\nthe aggregate) of any class of equity interests in the entity is held by “benefit plan investors.”\nFor purposes of the 25% test, the term “benefit plan investors” includes ERISA Plans, certain\nother retirement plans defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code (such as individual\nretirement accounts), and entities or accounts deemed to hold “plan assets” due to an\ninvestment in such entity or account by ERISA Plans or such other retirement plans (such as\ninsurance company general accounts). For the purposes of calculating the 25% threshold under\nthe Plan Assets Regulation, the value of any equity interest held by a person (other than a\n“benefit plan investor”) who has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of\nthe entity or that provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such\nassets (or an affiliate of such person) is disregarded.\nThe General Partner will use reasonable best efforts to conduct the affairs and operations of the\nFund in such a manner so that the assets of the Fund will not be treated as “plan assets” of any\n83\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nERISA Plan for purposes of ERISA. In particular, the General Partner will use reasonable best\nefforts to either (i) limit investment in the Fund by “benefit plan investors” to a level that would\nnot be considered “significant” under ERISA, or (ii) operate the Fund as a VCOC, or (iii) operate\nthe Fund in compliance with any other then-available exception to the general rule of plan asset\ntreatment. The General Partner has the authority to require a Limited Partner to withdraw from\nthe Fund (in whole or in part) where the General Partner determines that such withdrawal is\nnecessary to avoid having the Fund’s assets deemed to be “plan assets” subject to ERISA or\nSection 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, the Fund is not expected to be deemed to be holding\n“plan assets” subject to ERISA at any time.\nReporting\nBenefit plan investors may be required to report certain compensation paid by the Fund (or by\nthird parties) to the Fund’s service providers as “reportable indirect compensation” on Schedule\nC to the Form 5500 Annual Return (the “Form 5500”). To the extent any compensation\narrangements described herein constitute reportable indirect compensation, any such\ndescriptions are intended to satisfy the disclosure requirements for the alternative reporting\noption for “eligible indirect compensation,” as defined for purposes of Schedule C to the Form\n5500.\nAdditional Information\nERISA and its accompanying regulations are complex and, to a great extent, have not yet been\ninterpreted by the courts or the administrative agencies. This discussion does not purport to\nconstitute a thorough analysis of ERISA. Each prospective investor subject to ERISA should\nconsult with its own legal counsel concerning the implications under ERISA of an investment in\nthe Fund, and to confirm that such an investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt\nprohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement under ERISA.\n“Governmental plans” and certain “church plans”, while not subject to the fiduciary\nresponsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, may nevertheless be subject to\nstate or other federal laws that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA.\nDecision-makers for any such plans should consult with their counsel before making an\ninvestment in the Fund.\n84\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nXI. CERTAIN LEGAL & REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS\nSecurities Act of 1933\nThe Limited Partner Interests described herein will not be registered under the Securities Act in\nreliance upon the exemptions for transactions not involving a public offering. Each investor\nwill be required to make certain representations to the Fund, including that such investor is an\n“accredited investor” within the meaning of Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act, that it is\nacquiring a Limited Partner Interest in the Fund for its own account, for investment purposes\nonly and not with a view to resale or distribution, that it has received or has had access to all\ninformation it deems relevant to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in the Fund and\nthat it has the ability to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Fund. The Limited\nPartner Interests described herein will constitute “restricted securities” under the Securities Act\nand as such will be subject to certain restrictions on transferability. The Limited Partner\nInterests may not be transferred or sold unless the Limited Partner Interests have been\nregistered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available. It is not\ncontemplated that registration under the Securities Act or other securities laws will ever be\neffected. The Limited Partner Interests are subject to further restrictions on transfer as\ndescribed in the Partnership Agreement.\nThis Memorandum is not a public offering “prospectus” and does not purport to describe or\notherwise address all material considerations relating to an investment in the Fund. Prior to\nmaking an investment, prospective investors and their advisors are invited to ask questions of,\nand obtain additional information from, the General Partner concerning the Limited Partner\nInterests described herein, the terms and conditions of the offering and any other relevant\nmatters. Such information will be provided to the extent the General Partner possesses such\ninformation or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense.\nAny subscription is subject to a determination by counsel to the Fund that the subscription is in\ncompliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations.\nInvestment Company Act of 1940\nThe Fund will not be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act\npursuant to an exemption set forth in Section 3(c)(1) and/or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment\nCompany Act. The Fund will obtain appropriate representations and undertakings from all\npurchasers of Limited Partner Interests, including restrictions on transfer, to ensure that such\npurchasers meet the conditions of the exemption. Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company\nAct requires that each prospective purchaser be a “qualified purchaser” within the meaning of\nSection 2(a)(51) of the Investment Company Act. Information with respect to such requirements\nfor “qualified purchaser” status will be included in the Fund’s Subscription Agreement. The\nGeneral Partner is not registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act, or with the NASD,\nand is consequently not subject to certain record keeping and specific business practice\nprovisions of the Exchange Act and the rules of the NASD.\n85\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940\nNeither the Management Company nor the General Partner is currently registered as an\ninvestment adviser under the Advisers Act. By virtue of being exempt from the registration\nrequirements of the Advisers Act, the Management Company and the General Partner are not\nsubject to the performance fee restrictions and certain other restrictions contained in the\nAdvisers Act, and the investors in the Fund will not be afforded the protections provided under\nthe Advisers Act to clients of advisors that are registered under the Advisers Act. The General\nPartner, the Management Company or an affiliate thereof may in the future register as an\ninvestment adviser under the Advisers Act to the extent required under the Advisers Act.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner and the Partnership\n(together with their respective related persons) hereby disclaim any duties, obligations, or\nstatus as an advisor, finder, agent, broker or dealer on behalf or in respect of any person in\nconnection with such person’s actual or proposed investment in the Partnership.\nCompliance With Anti-Money Laundering Requirements\nIn response to increased regulatory requirements with respect to the sources of funds used in\ninvestments and other activities, the General Partner may require prospective investors to\nprovide documentation verifying, among other things, such investor’s (and any of its beneficial\nowners’) identities and source of funds used to purchase its Limited Partner Interest in the\nFund. The General Partner may decline to accept a subscription if this information is not\nprovided or on the basis of such information that is provided.\nEach prospective investor and Limited Partner will be required to make representations that\nsuch prospective investor or Limited Partner is not a prohibited country, territory, individual or\nentity listed on the U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)\nwebsite and that it is not directly or indirectly affiliated with any country, territory, individual\nor entity named on an OFAC list or prohibited by any OFAC sanctions programs. Such\nprospective investor or Limited Partner will also represent that amounts contributed by it to the\nFund were not directly or indirectly derived from activities that may contravene U.S. Federal,\nstate or international laws and regulations, including, without limitation, anti-money\nlaundering laws and regulations.\nRequests for documentation and additional information may be made at any time during which\nan investor holds a Limited Partner Interest in the Fund. The General Partner will take such\nsteps as it determines are necessary to comply with applicable law, regulations, orders,\ndirectives or special measures to implement anti-money laundering laws, which steps may\ninclude the forced sale or withdrawal of an Interest. In addition, the Fund could be required to\ndisclose information pertaining to prospective investors subscribing for an interest to\ngovernmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due\ndiligence or take other related actions in the future.\nPay-to-Play Laws, Regulations and Policies\nIn light of recent scandals involving money managers, a number of states and municipal\npension plans have adopted so-called “pay-to-play” laws, regulations or policies which\n86\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nprohibit, restrict or require disclosure of payments to (and/or certain contacts with) state\nofficials by individuals and entities seeking to do business with state entities, including\ninvestments by public retirement funds. The SEC also has recently adopted rules that, among\nother things, prohibit an investment adviser from providing advisory services for compensation\nwith respect to a government plan investor for two years after the adviser or certain of its\nexecutives or employees make a contribution to certain elected officials or candidates. If the\nManagement Company, the General Partner, their employees or affiliates fail to comply with\nsuch pay-to-play laws, regulations or policies, such non-compliance could have an adverse\neffect on the Fund by, for example, providing the basis for the withdrawal of the affected\ngovernment plan investor.\n87\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nXII. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nLegal Counsel\nProskauer Rose LLP (“Proskauer Rose”) acts as counsel to the Fund, the General Partner and\nthe Management Company in connection with the organization of the Fund and the offering of\nLimited Partner Interests therein. Proskauer Rose also acts as counsel to the Fund, the General\nPartner, the Management Company and their affiliates in connection with investments and\nongoing operations of the Fund and other matters. In connection with the offering of Limited\nPartner Interests and subsequent advice to the Fund, the General Partner, the Management\nCompany and their affiliates, Proskauer Rose will not be representing the Limited Partners of\nthe Fund. No independent counsel has been retained to represent the Limited Partners of the\nFund.

The synthetic net returns for the\nhealthcare technology investments in each Sprout Fund are an estimate of what the net returns\nwould have been for these investments, if they had been managed in a standalone healthcare\ntechnology venture capital fund structure rather than one set of investments as part of a larger,\ndiversified venture capital fund. The synthetic net returns were computed assuming a fund\nsize required to fund 100% of the total cost of the healthcare investments in each of the Sprout\nfunds using both called and recycled capital, a management fee of 2% payable quarterly and a\ncarried interest. The net return reflects reinvestment of certain proceeds, gains and other\nproceeds by the Sprout healthcare portfolio synthetic funds to the extent permitted under the\npartnership governing documents. A detailed example of the calculation is below.\nSprout IX: Total actual HCT investments of $740M; 2% management fees,\nresulting in $120M of management fees and expenses from inception-to-date;\n25% carried interest; Standalone fund size of $690M ($735M investments with\ncash recycling of 6%); Total realizations have been $1,375M and total remaining\nvalue is $50M. Assumes $130M in total carried interest to GPs already paid out;\nYields Total Distributed to LPs of $1,075M ($1,375M - $120M fees - $130M carry -\n$50M recycling) / $690M = 1.56x; Yields Total Remaining to LPs of $50M /\n$690M = 0.07x\n95\nCONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\nAppendix 3\nPME+ Methodology\nPublic Market Equivalent (“PME+”) is used to compare the net performance of each of the\nSprout HC synthetic funds and NLV funds to the performance of a same size, hypothetical\ninvestment in a fund that tracked a public market index. The investments in the hypothetical\npublic market index funds have identical cash inflow schedules and proportionately\ncomparable cash outflow schedules. The cash outflow schedules are set so that the remaining\nequity value of the public equivalent fund is exactly equal to the remaining equity value of the\nbenchmarked private equity fund at the end of the benchmarking period. The analysis is\npresented to illustrate the comparative returns a limited partner would have generated by\ninvesting in the hypothetical public market index fund at the same time and in the same\namounts as had been invested in each of the NLV or Sprout (HC portion only) synthetic funds.\nThe NLV or Sprout HC funds are presented as net, which includes the impact of management\nfees, expenses, and carried interest. The public market index funds do not have any impact of\nfees or carried interest.

Please\nrefer to Section III: “Summary of Historical Investment Performance” and the endnotes below\nfor a more detailed description of the performance of the NLV-I, NLV-II and the Sprout Funds.\nAn investment in the Fund does not represent an interest in any indicated investment or any\ninvestment portfolio of any related or other investment fund, including any investment or fund\nmanaged by the Fund Managers. Disclosure of past performance herein is for informational\npurposes only and is not indicative of future results.\nA The financial data contained herein relating to the valuations and investment performance of\nNLV-I, NLV-II, the Sprout Funds and their investments (including the I.C. portfolio thereof)\nare estimates prepared by NLV as of March 31, 2014, and have not been audited. The vintage\nyear of each fund represents the first year that an investment in a portfolio company was\neither committed to or funded. While NLV’s valuations of unrealized investments are based\non assumptions that NLV believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the actual realized\nreturns on unrealized investments will depend on, among other factors, future operating\nresults, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related\ntransaction costs and the timing and manner of the sale, all of which may differ from the\nassumptions on which the valuations used in the prior performance data contained herein are\nbased. Accordingly, the actual realized returns on these unrealized investments may differ\nmaterially and adversely from the (assumed) returns indicated herein. Past performance is\nnot indicative of future results. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results\ncomparable to those shown herein, will be able to avoid losses or will be able to achieve its\ninvestment objectives. Except as specifically noted, all performance information contained\nherein is on a “gross” basis before giving effect to management fees, the general partner’s\ncarried interest, taxes and other expenses, the application of which would reduce such prior\nperformance and indicated rates of return. Except as otherwise indicated, performance\ninformation is for NLV-I, NLV-II and the Fund Managers’ investments in the Sprout Funds.\nWhile the Fund Managers initiated, led, co-led, managed or were otherwise instrumental in\nthe identification, negotiation, execution and/or management of these investments (as further\ndescribed herein), other individuals, including individuals from Sprout Group with respect to\nthe Sprout Funds, were involved in and assisted with these investments.\nB Rates of return for public indices are provided for informational purposes only and do not\nreflect a basis for comparison for venture capital interests, as the market volatility, liquidity\nand other characteristics of venture capital investments are materially different from public\nindices.

Where results on the Sprout Funds refer to net basis, it is the result of a\nmethodology that adjusts the gross results for the healthcare technology investments for\nrecycling, management fees, and carried interest so they can be compared to industry sources\n(e.g., Cambridge Associates) on a directly comparable basis. The methodology and\nassumptions used to adjust from gross to net basis is described in Appendix 2.\nD The gross annual compound internal rate of return (“IRR”) and gross multiple of invested\ncapital as of March 31, 2014 are before giving effect to taxes, management fees, the general\npartner’s carried interest and other expenses. The net IRR and net multiple of invested capital\nas of March 31, 2014 are after giving effect to management fees, the general partner’s carried\ninterest and other expenses. All IRRs presented are annualized and calculated on the basis of\nquarterly inflows and outflows of cash and unrealized values, assuming such inflows and\noutflows occurred as of quarter end and all remaining investments were sold at the current\nholding value through as of March 31, 2014. There can be no assurance that unrealized\ninvestments will be realized at the valuations shown.\nE The results for the Sprout Funds represent results from the healthcare technology portion of\nthe Sprout Funds, which represents between 8% and 65% of the cost basis of the investments\nof the funds taken as a whole.

The concept of “foreign collective\ninvestment scheme” covers, inter alia, foreign companies and similar schemes (including those created on the basis of\na collective investment contract or a contract of another type with similar effect) created for the purpose of collective\ninvestment, whether such companies or schemes are closed end or open end. There are reasonable grounds to believe\nthat the Fund would be characterized as a foreign collective investment scheme under Swiss law. As interests in the\nFund have not been and cannot be registered with or authorized by FINMA for distribution to non-qualified\ninvestors, any offering of interests in the Fund, and any other form of solicitation of investors in relation to the Fund\n(including by way of circulation of offering materials or information, including this Memorandum), must be\nrestricted to investors considered as qualified investors within the meaning of the CISA and its implementing\nregulations.
