Cabot Professor of American Literature \nNovember 25, 2018 \nDear Ms. Williams: \nTel: \nFax: \nI am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest of Poetry in America \n(poetryinamerica.org). Poetry in America's first season's guests included Bill Clinton, \nJoe Biden, Cynthia Nixon, Shaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Samantha Power, Herbie \nHancock, John McCain, Nas, Angela Duckworth, Bono, Regina Spektor, Frank Gehry, \nStuart Weitzman, E.O. Wilson, and many others. Seasons Two and Three will feature just \nas distinguished a line up. The series airs on public television stations everywhere, \nstreams via Amazon Prime and other streaming services, and it is now also airing on a \nvariety of domestic and international airlines. \nThe poem we'd read and interpret together is by Pulitzer Prize winner Sharon Olds, and \nit's called \"The Language of the Brag.\" It's a gutsy poem that compares feats of (male) \nathletic prowess—and feats of poetic prowess—to childbirth. You are the ideal reader for \nthis poem. We would use what we filmed together in an upcoming season of Poetry in \nAmerica. We would also use the content in an online course for medical professionals I \nam creating in partnership with Harvard Medical School. Everything we create would be \nnon-commercial and educational. \nThank you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work with you. \nSincerely, \nElisa New \nDirector and Host of Poetry in America \nPowell M. Cabot Professor, Harvard \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029517 \n"
