Invisible Forces Operating on Human\nBodies\nGravity is an invisible force that holds us\nto the surface of the earth, and the fact\nthat gravity is invisible does not place it\nbeyond scientific scrutiny. Similarly,\nhumans are a quintessentially social\nspecies whose need for social connection\nproduces invisible forces on our brain,\nbehavior, and biology that are subject to\nscientific investigation. Among these are\nforces that compel us to seek trusting and\nmeaningful connections with others and\nto seek meaning and connection with\nsomething bigger than ourselves. The\nstory of these invisible forces speaks to\nwho we are as a species.\nFrom Selfish Genes to Social Brains\n2. The Social Nature of Humankind\nThe human brain has evolved under the\nguidance of selfish genes to produce\nmore than a brain that is capable of\npowerful, isolated information\nprocessing operations. The human brain\nalso evolved with inherent capacities for\nsocial cognition, compassion, empathy,\nbonding, coordination, cooperation,\nvalues, mortality and a need for social\nconnection that extends beyond kin and\neven other individuals.\nFrom Inclusive Fitness to Spiritual\nStriving \n \n3. Science, Religion, and a Revised\nReligious Humanism\nThe dialogue between science and\nreligion, if properly pursued, can usher in\na new era of religious humanism in the\nleading world religions. Their central\nbeliefs and practices largely would\nremain intact, but their views of nature\nand their concerns with health and wellbeing\nwould be refined through their\nconversations with the sciences. How\nthis model would work is discussed in\nterms of the relation between love and\nhealth in Christian theology – especially\nthe tension between the agape, caritas,\nand eros models of Christian love.\n \nThe Status of the Body Politic and the\nStatus of the Body Itself\n \n4. Health by Connection: From Social\nBrains to Resilient Bodies\nMost people feel socially connected most\nof the time. Felt connectedness is\ntypically taken for granted, but the\neffects of its absence, as experienced in\nfeelings of isolation, demonstrate that\nour evolutionary heritage as a social\nspecies has potent implications for health\nand well-being.\n \nFrom Relationships to People and\nGroups to Relationships with God \n \n5. Psychosomatic Relations: From\nSuperstition to Mortality\nIt has long been recognized that mental\nstates can impact health and well being,\nbut the causal pathways have only\nrecently begun to be understood.\nThoughts, beliefs and attitudes can have\npowerful effects on physiological\nfunctions, health and disease. Examples\nrange from superstitious beliefs\nassociated with voodoo, bone pointing,\nor other black rituals to the more positive\nstates associated with spirituality. The\npresent essay considers these disparate\npsychological states and how they might\ntranslate into physiological effects\nhaving real health implications.\n \nThe Mind and Body Are One \n \n6. The Suspension of Individual\nConsciousness and the Dissolution of\nSelf and Other Boundaries\nA special case of social interaction\nconcerns two or more individuals\nengaging in temporally coordinated\nPage | 3\nactions that imply particular timing\npatterns such as synchrony or rhythmic\nturn taking such as applauding in unison\nor the ‘wave’ that is produced by\nthousands of individual sports fans in a\nstadium. A model to explain such\nsynchronized behavior is proposed in\nterms of the neural processes that are\njointly recruited. One of the main\nimplications suggested by this model is\nthat taking part in or being part of a\nsynchronized social interaction gives rise\nto a qualitative shift in subjective\nexperience due to the difficulty of\napplying an individual centered\nexplanation to collectively produced\nspontaneous co-action.\nYou and I as One\n7. Action at a Distance: The Invisible\nForce of Language\nLanguage forms the fabric of our social\ninstitutions and makes tangible the nature\nof our relationships. Although the\nfunction of language is typically viewed\nin terms of the information content that it\nprovides, some of the social function of\nlanguage may depend on the way it\naffects us. The idea of language impact\n– how language directly affects our\nemotions and social connections – may\nbe fundamental to the way the social\nbrain functions to connect people.\n \nSystems and Signals for Social\nCoordination  \n8. Hidden Forces in Understanding\nOthers: Mirror Neurons and\nNeurobiological Underpinnings\nSpecific brain regions in the monkey\ncontain individual brain cells, or neurons,\nthat respond to both observation and\nexecution of identical hand and mouth\nactions. Brain imaging in humans has\ndemonstrated that our brains have\nsimilarly localized regions with similar\nproperties. These areas respond to\nexecution of goal-directed actions of the\nhand and mouth and during observation\nof the same or similar actions.\nInterestingly, these brain regions in the\nhuman are also responsive to observation\nand imitation of facial movements, and\nappear to be sensitive to their emotional\ncontent.\n \nConnecting and Binding Social Brains\nand Minds\n \n9. Empathy and Interpersonal Sensitivity\nEmpathy is thought to play a key role in\nmotivating prosocial behavior, guiding\nour preferences and behavioral\nresponses, and providing the affective\nand motivational base for moral\ndevelopment. While folk conceptions of\nempathy view it as the capacity to share,\nunderstand and respond with care to the\naffective states of others, neuroscience\nresearch demonstrates that these\ncomponents can be dissociated. Empathy\nis not a unique characteristic of human\nconsciousness, but it is an important\nadaptive behavior that evolved with the\nmammalian brain. However, humans are\nspecial in the sense that high-level\ncognitive abilities (language, theory of\nmind, executive functions) are layered on\ntop of phylogenetically older social and\nemotional capacities. These higher level\ncognitive and social capacities expand\nthe range of behaviors that can be driven\nby empathy.\n \nSeeing into My Mind and Other Minds\n \n10. Seeing Invisible Minds\nOther minds are inherently invisible.\nBeing able to \"see\" them requires\nlearning about other minds, attending to\nother minds, and projecting one's own\nmind onto others, and seeing minds in\nother agents can mean the difference\nbetween treating others as humans versus\nas objects.\n \nInferring Minds When None Can be\nSeen\n \n11. Anthropomorphism: Human\nConnection to a Universal Society\nPage | 4\nThe human motivation for social\nconnection extends beyond the boundary\nof the human in the (often\nmisunderstood) religious language of\nanthropomorphism. In this chapter, an\ninfamous sermon from colonial\nAmerica—“Sinners in the Hands of an\nAngry God”—is used to illustrate the\nway anthropomorphic language works to\nincorporate human society in a web of\nethical obligations that connect to the\nnatural environment and, by imaginative\nextension, to the universe as a whole.\n \nPersonifications of God\n \n12. How Does God Become Real\nBecoming a person of faith is not so\nmuch about acquiring certain beliefs\nbut about learning to use one’s mind\nin particular ways; the often intensely\nprivate experience of God is built\nthrough a profoundly social learning\nprocess.\n \nBelief and Connection\n \n13. Theological Perspectives on God as\nan Invisible Force\nThe beliefs that religious individuals\nhold about the way God operates in\nhuman life are potential factors affecting\nperceived social isolation. My paper\ndiscusses a specific type of such belief\nthat is common in the history of\nChristian thought: the belief that God is\nan invisible force of a rather impersonal\nsort working for the good in everything\nthat happens. The paper argues that this\nsort of belief has as great or greater\npotential than belief in God as a personal\nfriend to give one the sense that one is\nnever alone, but the conception of God\nas pervasive can also lead to inattention\nand disconnection.\n \nThe Elusiveness of Meaningful\nConnection\n \n14. Visible Efforts to Change Invisible\nConnections\nDespite the human need for social\nconnection, many individuals are lonely\nbecause they are unable to create\nmeaningful social bonds. Interventions\ndesigned to reduce loneliness have not\nbeen successful, suggesting that a better\nunderstanding of loneliness, social\nconnection, and the obstacles to forming\nmeaningful connections with others is\nneeded.\n \nReflections on Invisible Connections\n \n15. Social Brain, Spiritual Medicine?\nScience and religion are inextricably\nintertwined in the practice of medicine.\nScience has provided modern medicine\nwith extraordinary diagnostic and\ntherapeutic capacities that can be\nemployed to care for patients. Religions\nprovide a fuller vision for the worthiness\nof caring for the sick, a framework to\nguide the application of medical science\nin that endeavor, and practices that\nstrengthen the human capacity for\ntreating patients as the mindful persons\nthey are.\nInvisible Forces \n16. Epilogue\nInvisible forces that connect individuals\nto society, or to each other, have effects\nat both ends of the connection. As\nhumans we are fundamentally individual\nand fundamentally social. We\nencompass both the pursuit of rational\nself interest of Homo economicus and the\npursuit of approval, belonging, and\nintimacy of Homo socialis, the former\ngrounded in eros, the latter in agape.\nThese forces acting together represent a\nsignature feature of Homo sapiens (the\nwise ones) and have contributed a record\nof influence and impact– both positive\nand negative –that is unmatched in\nbiology.\nPage | 5\nPreface\nWe view our past through a\nreverse telescope, making it seem like\ncontemporary events are a much larger\npart of our history than they are.\nHominids have been estimated to have\nevolved about 7 million years ago, with\nour species having evolved only within\napproximately the last 1% of that period.\nThe human brain was sculpted by\nevolutionary forces over tens of\nthousands of years, whereas the human\nachievements we take for granted, such\nas civilizations, law, and art, have\nemerged only during the past few\nthousands of years. A mere 300 years\nago, theology and philosophy were the\nprincipal disciplinary lenses through\nwhich the world was viewed, and from\nwhich explanations and instruction were\nsought. Advances in science over the\npast 300 years have transformed how we\nthink, act, and live. Nearly every aspect\nof human existence, ranging from\nagriculture, commerce, and\ntransportation to technology,\ncommunication, and medicine, has been\ntransformed by contemporary science.\nWe have no hesitation to accept\nscientific explanations of physical\nentities being influenced by invisible\nforces such as gravity, magnetism, and\ngenes. But when human mentation and\nbehavior are the objects to be explained,\ndeterministic scientific accounts seem to\nmany to be less satisfying.\nFor some, science and modernity\nare akin to the apple in the Garden of\nEden, responsible for our fall from\nGrace. For others, theology and religion\nrepresent little more than the stuff of\nsuperstition with no place in an educated\nsociety.\nAbout six years ago, we had the\nopportunity to create a most unusual\ngroup of scholars to examine questions\nabout the invisible forces acting on,\nwithin, and between human bodies.\nSuperb scholars who individually had\nmade major contributions to their own\ndisciplinary field – fields as divergent as\nneuroscience and medicine to\nphilosophy and theology – were invited\nto form an interdisciplinary network of\nscholars to consider such questions. The\ndevelopment of these discussions even\nover the first few meetings truly\nastonished us all. We decided to share\nwhat we learned through the present\nbook, which represents a different\nperspective, one in which our\nunderstanding of human nature is\nenriched by serious insights and scrutiny\nthat each perspective has to offer.\nTheology and religion have always\nrelied on unseen forces as the basis for\nexplanations of human behavior and\nexperience. Science has been able to\nexplicate those forces even if along\ndifferent lines than originally conceived.\nAs we start to consider some of the more\ncomplex aspects of human nature,\nscience and theology may be able to\nwork together to shed light on some of\nthese complexities.\nWe begin this preface and each\nchapter with a word cloud produced\nusing Wordle at http://www.wordle.net.\nIn the case of this preface, it illustrates\nkey concepts that are found in this book.\nIn the case of the chapters, the word\ncloud in each provides a visualization of\nPage | 6\nthe key terms and ideas expressed in that\nchapter. Each chapter, in turn,\nrepresents a contribution led by a\nparticular member to the network but\nbroadened to reflect the interactions of\nthe network on that topic. Perusal of the\nword clouds across chapters makes the\nflow of ideas more visible. Together,\nthe chapters speak to who we are as a\nspecies and the nature of the invisible\nforces that make us such a unique\nspecies. For instance, humans seem to\nstrive for social connections in a variety\nof ways from friendships to\nidentification with groups to religious\naffiliations. A major thesis of this book\nis that we are fundamentally a social\nspecies, and that this journey is less a\nmarch toward isolation and autonomy\nthan it is a march to competence,\ninterdependence, coordination,\ncooperation, and social resilience.\nGuiding us through this journey are our\nsocial brains, which have evolved to\ncreate anything but a blank slate at birth.\nWe owe a debt of thanks to many\nfor their contributions and support over\nthe years, but we owe special thanks to\nBarnaby Marsh for approaching us with\nthe idea of forming such a network and\nfor his many contributions to the\nnetwork, and to the John Templeton\nFoundation for their support and for their\nencouragement to pursue questions,\nideas, and conclusions of our science\nregardless of where they led.\nPage | 7\nChapter 1 1\nInvisible Forces Operating on Human\nBodies\nWe may believe we know why\nwe think, feel, and act as we do, but\nvarious forces influence us in ways that\nare largely invisible to our senses.\nGravity is an invisible force that holds us\nto the surface of the earth, and\nmagnetism is an invisible force that we\nuse in everyday life. The fact that\ngravity and magnetism are invisible to us\ndoes not place them beyond scientific\nscrutiny. Similarly, there are a host of\nforces that, over the course of human\nevolution, have emerged to influence our\nthoughts, emotions, and behaviors.\nBecause many of these forces are\n1 The Chicago Social Brain Network is a group\nof more than a dozen scholars from the\nneurosciences, behavioral sciences, social\nsciences, and humanities who share an interest in\nwho we are as a species and the role of\nbiological and social factors in the shaping of\nindividuals, institutions, and societies across\nhuman history.\nThe scientists and scholars in the\nNetwork differ in background, epistemologies,\nbeliefs, and methods. After five years of\nworking together, we found a common set of\nthemes to have emerged in our work despite the\ndifferences among us. These themes, which\nprovide a different perspective on how we might\nthink about human history, experience, and\nspirituality, are examined here and explored in\nmore detail in subsequent chapters.\nelemental, we will be dealing with an\narea of human behavior that has also\nbeen addressed for centuries by various\nreligions. Among these are forces that\ncompel us to seek trusting and\nmeaningful connections with others and\nto seek meaning and connection with\nsomething larger than ourselves. The\nstory of these invisible forces speaks to\nwho we are and what our potential might\nbe as a species. In short, it is the story\nof the human mind.\nThe mind can be thought of as\nthe structure and processes responsible\nfor cognition, emotion, and behavior. It\nis now widely recognized that many\nstructures and processes of the mind\noperate outside of awareness, with only\nthe end products reaching awareness,\nand then only sometimes. But clearly we\nknow a great deal about the mind from\nwhat we experience through our senses.\nIt is just commonsense that we know the\nshape or color of an object from simply\nseeing it.\nOr do we? It is obvious that the\ntops of the tables depicted in the top\npanel of Figure 1 differ in size and\nshape. You may be surprised to learn\nthat your mind is fooling you, that the\ntops of the table are precisely the same\nsize and shape. If you don’t believe it,\ntrace and cut a piece of paper the size of\none table\ntop and\nthen place\nit over the\nother.\nSelfevident\ntruths can sometimes be absolutely false.\n\nPage | 8\nThe science of the mind is not\nunique in this regard. As the historian\nDaniel Boorstin (1983, 1) noted:\nNothing could be more obvious\nthan that the earth is stable and\nunmoving, and that we are the\ncenter of the universe. Modern\nWestern science takes its\nbeginning from the denial of this\ncommonsense axiom . . .\nCommon sense, the foundation\nof everyday life, could no longer\nserve for the governance of the\nworld. When “scientific”\nknowledge, the sophisticated\nproduct of complicated\ninstruments and subtle\ncalculations, provided\nunimpeachable truths, things\nwere no longer as they seemed.”\n(p. 294)\nAnd just as the observation that we roam\non stable ground led to the incorrect\ninference that we are the center of the\nuniverse, so too is the modern notion\nthat the human brain is a solitary,\nautonomous instrument whose\nconnections with other brains is a matter\nof deliberate choice and of no real\nimport.\nThe human brain, the organ of\nthe mind, is housed deep within the\ncranial vault, where it is protected and\nisolated from others, so it may seem\nobvious that the brain is a solitary\ninformation processing device that has\nno special means of connecting with\nother brains. But we are fundamentally\na social species. Faces, expressive\ndisplays, and human speech receive\npreferential processing in neonate as\nwell as adult brains. When a person\nfeels rejected by others, their brain\nshows the same pattern of activation as\nwhen they are exposed to a physically\npainful stimulus. Permit a person to\ncooperate with others, and their brain\nshows the same pattern of activation as\nwhen they are given a rich reward such\nas delicious food or drink. We may not\nbe aware of it, but human evolution has\nsculpted a human need for social\nconnection, along with neural circuits\nand hormonal processes that enable and\npromote communication and connection\nacross brains. As we shall see in the\nchapters to follow, our sociality is an\nimportant part of who we are as a\nspecies and it plays an important though\noften invisible role in the operations of\nour brain and our biology. Among the\nquestions we examine is whether our\nsocial brain also contributes to the\nubiquitous human quest for spirituality.\nThe Chicago Social Brain Network\nFor hundreds of years, theology\nand philosophy were the hub disciplines\nof scholarship, and other fields of\ninquiry orbited around this dyad and\nwere tightly constrained by it. Over the\npast three centuries, the sciences have\ncome into their own, displacing theology\nand philosophy at the center of the\nacademic universe. In so doing, they\nhave produced extraordinary advances in\neveryday life. People may reminisce\nabout the good old days, but thanks to\nscience and technology the amount of\ntotal income spent on the necessities of\nfood, clothing, and shelter dropped from\n80% in 1901 to 50% in 2002/2003. Yet\nthere remains an inchoate sense that\nsomething is missing in our lives,\nsomething intangible and elusive.\nScience has improved our material lives,\nbut improvements in material life may\nnot be enough to optimize human well\nbeing.\nCan these two very different\nways of seeing the world be used\nPage | 9\nsynergistically to shed new light on the\nhuman mind? In the Fall of 2004, we\nestablished an ongoing network of more\nthan a dozen scholars unbounded by\ndisciplinary precincts, geographical\nborders, or methodological perspectives\nto set aside antagonisms that had grown\nup between science and humanities in\norder to explore this question. These\nNetwork scholars hail from disciplines\nas disparate as psychology, neurology,\ntheology, statistics, philosophy, internal\nmedicine, anthropology, and sociology.\nEach of these scholars was well known\nin their own field and were busy with\nother obligations, but it was the\nopportunity to achieve a deeper, more\ncomprehensive discussion of the human\nmind that made it worth the time and\neffort it required to be part of the\nNetwork.\nAlthough various members of the\nNetwork interact on a daily or weekly\nbasis, the entire Network convenes twice\nannually for a four-day retreat to discuss\neach other’s research, to critique each\nother and to learn from one other.\nScientific analyses characterized by\nrigorous experimental designs and data\nanalytic strategies are interlaced with\nrich philosophical, theological, and\nhistorical analyses of the same questions\nabout invisible forces that act on us all.\nThe dialogue between the Network\nscientists and the scholars from the\nhumanities and theology is bidirectional.\nFor instance, the beliefs and behavior\ndescribed in the humanities and theology\nare rich in hypotheses that can now be\ntested empirically, and the measures and\nmethods of the behavioral sciences and\nneurosciences now permit rigorous\ninvestigation of some of these\nhypotheses. Each of the Network\nmembers brings a unique perspective to\nthe study of the human mind, and the\nprovocative story of the mind that is\nemerging from the collective efforts of\nthe Network is the subject of this book.\nThe Network is unconventional\nin other ways, as well. Traditionally,\nscientists and scholars work together to\nachieve a common understanding and a\nconsensus position. We quickly learned\nthat we did not need to come to a\nconsensus to benefit tremendously from\nthe dialogue on the capacity and\nmotivation for the ubiquitous human\nquest for sociality and spirituality. For\ninstance, there is no consensus within\nthe Network on whether there is a God,\nand we do not seek here to provide the\nfinal word on what science and the\nhumanities each have to say to the other\nabout the human mind. Instead, our\npurpose is to illustrate the possibility and\nimportance of engaging others whose\nviews we may not share in a serious\ndialogue on such topics. Among the\nlessons we as a Network have learned\nare:\n1. that some questions about human\nnature and our social and\nspiritual aspirations have been\nasked by humankind for\nthousands of years. Accordingly,\nthere may be more to be gained\nfrom engaging in a collaborative\nprocess of thinking about these\nquestions than from demanding\nsimple and immediate answers.\nWe discuss what we see as\npossible answers to questions\nabout our nature and strivings,\nbut the value in stating these\npositions is to have clear\npositions from which to move\nthinking and research forward.\nThus, our purpose in writing this\nbook is to articulate ideas to be\nshaped and refined, not to\nprovide the final word.\nPage | 10\n2. that one need not agree with a\nposition to perform a deep and\nthorough analysis of the\narguments for and against the\nposition. Objectivity in thought\nand analysis are keys to reaching\na deep understanding of a topic.\nBy taking a position, developing\narguments for and against the\nposition, then taking the opposite\nposition and doing likewise, we\ndevelop the capacity to be more\ndispassionate and powerful\nthinkers – and gain deeper\ninsight into a topic.\n3. that one need not reach\nagreement with someone to learn\na great deal from discussions\nwith them or to make significant\nadvances in addressing a\ncomplex question. The salve of\naffirmation can lead us to seek\nlike-minded others and to\ndenigrate and avoid those who\ndisagree with us. Although this\nmay provide temporary comfort,\nit does little to help address deep\ndivisions or solve problems with\nwhich we must deal in an\nincreasingly complex and diverse\nworld. There are inherent\ntensions between the sciences\nand the humanities, and these\ntensions have led to a\npolarization of views, an “it’s my\nway or the highway” approach\ntoward those holding divergent\npoints of view. The contents of\nthis book illustrate an alternative\npossibility. The Network is a\nvery interdisciplinary group, and\nthe perspectives captured in the\nsubsequent chapters reflect some\nof the same tensions with which\nother books dealing with science\nand religion have dealt – and\nfrom which they have not\nbenefitted. The tensions reflect\ndeep and enduring differences in\nthe way in which scholars in the\nhumanities, the social sciences,\nand the sciences think about\ntheory, methods, and evidence.\nThese differences can test one’s\nmettle but if acknowledged,\nrespected, embraced, and\npursued, they result in a richer,\nmore innovative and synergistic\ncollaborative effort. In the case\nof our Network, this was neither\neasy nor quick, but it was\nachieved through a mutual\nrespect and exchange of ideas\nand a shared conviction\nregarding the importance of the\nNetwork’s combination of\napproaches from the humanities\nand the sciences. In a sense, our\nNetwork is a microcosm of the\nstructure that exists in our\nsociety. If these tensions are\nembraced and used to their full\ncatapultic effect, one can make\nprogress on serious problems,\ntransforming not only how we\nthink about the problem, but also\nhow we think about those who\nhold different or opposing views.\n4. that the insights or advances we\ncan achieve need not be our or\nour opponent’s position, or a\nless-than optimal compromise\nbetween the two, but rather they\ncan be truly innovative, building\non and transcending both initial\npositions. The specific forms of\nsuch creative and transcendent\nsolutions are difficult to\narticulate in advance but there is\na thought process – characterized\nby clarity, openness, constructive\ncriticism, and synthesis – that\nPage | 11\nBackground\nincreases the likelihood one will\nreach such solutions. All of the\nperspectives discussed in this\nbook have been transformed\nthrough this process.\nIn pursuing the tandem lines of\ninquiry of science and the humanities,\nthe Network itself serves as an example\nof the human capacities and emergent\nprocesses that can derive from collective\nsocial structures and actions. In the\nchapters to follow, the Network\nexamines the nature and power of\nunseen forces ranging from human coregulation\nto physiological effects of\nspiritual beliefs. The exchanges across\ndisciplinary perspectives suggest that the\n“dominion of the solitary individual” is\ninsufficient to understand the human\nmind or to optimize human health and\nwell being. To understand human nature\nand the human mind, one may need to\nappreciate human needs and capabilities\nthat have not been given due attention.\nHomo sapiens are a social\nspecies, which means there are emergent\norganizations beyond individuals that\ncontribute to the ability of our species to\nsurvive, reproduce, and care for our\noffspring sufficiently long that they too\nsurvive to reproduce. As a consequence,\nevolutionary forces have sculpted neural,\nhormonal, and genetic mechanisms that\nsupport these social structures. Among\nthe possible consequences explored in\nthis book are that: 1) people are not the\nentirely self-interested, short-term\nthinking, rational decision makers\nassumed by the mythical creature, Homo\neconomicus, and 2) some of the\namorphous dissatisfaction and chronic\ndiseases that characterize contemporary\nsociety may be, in part, the consequence\nof the denial of the differences between\nthe nature of these two beings. Existing\nscientific studies of religion have\nestablished the pervasiveness of\nreligious beliefs and practices and an\nassociation between these beliefs or\npractices and physical as well as mental\nhealth. Religious beliefs and practices\nhave also contributed to failures to heed\nlife-saving medical advice and to the\nhorrendous treatment of others. It will\nbe through the serious investigation of\nsuch beliefs and practices, not through\ntheir denial, that we may ultimately be\nable to identify which aspects of these\nbeliefs and practices are beneficial, for\nwhat individuals and in what contexts,\nand through what specific mechanisms.\nRecent research has made it\npatently clear that William James (1890,\np. 442, 2) underestimated the faculties of\nhuman infants when he suggested that\ntheir first sensory experiences were a\n“blooming, buzzing confusion.” But\nwhat James’ sentiment did capture is the\noverwhelming complexity and\nuncertainty that exists in the child’s\nenvironment, and the inherent difficulty\nin making sense of that complexity from\nscratch. Our drive to make meaning is\nirrepressible---and when we do not\nunderstand the forces that drive our\nactions, we invent narratives that make\nthese invisible forces feel more\npredictable and understandable even if\nonly in hindsight. But we do not do it\nalone.\nAdults as well as children must\nexplain the uncertainty and ambiguity of\nnatural phenomena (calamities of\nweather, death and reproduction) as well\nas social phenomena (human agents) in\norder to operate effectively. But not all\nactions are perceived as being\nequivalent. Forces operating on objects\nto compel action, as when gravity causes\nrocks to slide down a mountain, are\nPage | 12\nviewed as external causes. Forces\noperating on human bodies to produce\naction, in contrast, are viewed as\nreflective of purpose, driven not only by\nexternal causes but, more importantly,\nby abstract reasons such as goals,\naspirations, and destiny. The meaningmaking\nproclivities of humans are so\nirrepressible that when external forces\noperate on human bodies to produce a\nsignificant impact on humankind, even\nthe causes of the actions of these human\nbodies tend to be regarded in terms of\nmore abstract purposes and reasons. The\nanthropomorphic description of\nhurricanes is a case in point.\nActions of objects have causes,\nwhereas actions of humans have reasons.\nInvisible forces that operate on humans\nbut that appear to operate independent of\nhuman agency have been the subject of\nreligious speculations for centuries.\nThese invisible forces include: internal\nneural and biological forces (e.g.,\nhomeostatic processes, autonomic\nactivity) that exert regulatory forces\nwhich are largely hidden from conscious\nexperience or control; strong emotions\nthat seem to arise apart from conscious\nhuman intention (e.g., rage, fear,\nempathy); phenomena such as dreams or\nhallucinations that seemingly operate\nindependent from the human will;\nmotivations, biases, inclinations,\npredilections (such as\nanthropomorphism, ambiguity\navoidance, preference for simple\nexplanations, etc.) whose presence is so\nuniversal that, like language, the\ncapacities for their development or\nexpression may have an evolutionary\nbasis; individual beliefs (such as the\nbelief that there is a reality outside our\nhead/we are not dreaming; the belief in\nhuman freedom; in values such as\nequality, etc), attitudes, preferences,\ngoals, or intentions; aggregated beliefs\nthat result in social norms, values,\nreligion, culture, and social movements;\nand codified forces such as decrees,\nrules, alliances, and laws.\nBefore the enlightenment of the\n18th century, many scholars believed\nthat thought was instantaneous and that\naction was governed by an indivisible\nmind separate from the body. If a\npalpable cause for a person’s behavior\ncould not be identified, the Divine or\nsome counterpart constituted a more\nagreeable explanatory construct than\ninvisible forces acting through\nscientifically specifiable mechanisms.\nUnparalleled advances in the sciences\nhave occurred since the dawn of the\nEnlightenment, including the\ndevelopment of scientific theories about\nmagnetism, gravity, quantum mechanics,\nand dark matter that depict invisible\nforces operating with measurable effects\non physical bodies. During this same\nperiod, serious scientific research on\ninvisible forces acting within, on and\nacross human bodies was slowed and\nunderfunded in part because the study of\nthe human mind and behavior was\nregarded by many in the public and in\npolitics as soft and of dubious validity.\nThe result is that many still regard the\nmind and behavior as best understood in\nterms of the actions of non-scientific\nagents, such as a god or gods, and the\nmanifestations of mental illness as the\nresult of a failure of individual will – a\ndenial of the possibility that invisible\nforces (that is, forces that are tractable\nscientifically but of which a person is\nnot normally aware) can affect mind and\nbehavior.\nOne could try to explain away\nthe gap in scientific knowledge about\ninvisible forces by referring to the\nconception of science and religion as\nPage | 13\nsystems of knowledge that are in\nopposition. This approach is common\nand evident in a spate of contemporary\nbooks that take the position that science\nand religion represent competing ways\nof understanding the world and that\nscience (or religion) is the one and only\nvalid way of understanding human\nbehavior and the world around us (3-8).\nFor instance, in The God Delusion,\nRichard Dawkins places specific Judeo-\nChristian theological doctrines under the\nscrutiny of science only to find that none\npasses scientific muster.\nThe vast majority of people from\nall educational backgrounds continue to\nharbor strong religious beliefs that affect\ntheir daily decisions and behavior, with\nboth good and ill effects. These\nreligious belief systems most commonly\nbump into scientific claims around\ninvisible forces. When science opens up\nopportunities to improve the human\ncondition by providing a more complete\nunderstanding of the causes of events,\ntheir measurable effects, and possible\ninterventions– ranging from valid\nscience education to medical\nadvancements based on stem cell\nresearch – these opportunities are often\nthreatened by the application of specific\nreligious beliefs to these endeavors.\nScientific research to understand religion\nand religious belief systems may be a\nmore productive response than broad\ndenouncements by scientists of any who\nhold such beliefs.\nConversely, when religion opens\nup opportunities for improving the\nhuman condition by questioning the\nemphasis on short-term self-interests at\nthe expense of the collective, providing a\nmore complete understanding of the\nhuman need to attribute meaning to\nevents and their effects, and identifying\npossible interventions– ranging from the\nprovision of tangible support to\nindividuals in need, to the promotion of\nhealthy lifestyles and ethical behavior–\nscientific research to understand these\ninfluences may again be a more\nproductive response than broad\ndenouncements by scientists that such\nbeliefs are irrational. Indeed, the\nquestion of whether God exists is of\nmuch less scientific interest, and of\nmuch more questionable scientific merit\n(how would one scientifically falsify\nsuch a claim?), than the question of the\ncauses, consequences, and underlying\nmechanisms for the observable human\nbehaviors affected by invisible forces---\nwhether they be physical (gravity),\nsocial (groups), or perceived spiritual\n(gods).\nContemporary science explains\nmany of these phenomena but also\npoints to the human capacities and\nemergent processes that derive from\ncollective social structures and actions\nand, underlying the emergence of these\nstructures, the human need for meaningmaking\nand connecting to something\nbeyond oneself. The dominant metaphor\nfor the scientific study of the human\nmind during the latter half of the 20 th\ncentury has been the computer – a\nsolitary device with massive information\nprocessing capacities. Computers today\nare massively interconnected devices\nwith capacities that extend far beyond\nthe resident hardware and software of a\nsolitary computer. The extended\ncapacities made possible by the internet\ncan be said to be emergent because they\nrepresent a whole that is greater than the\nsimple sum of the actions that are\npossible by the sum of the individual\n(disconnected) computers that constitute\nthe internet. The telereceptors (e.g.,\neyes, ears) of the human brain have\nprovided wireless broadband\nPage | 14\ninterconnectivity to humans for\nmillennia. Just as computers have\ncapacities and processes that are\ntransduced through but extend far\nbeyond the hardware of a single\ncomputer, the human brain has evolved\nto promote social and cultural capacities\nand processes that are transduced\nthrough but that extend far beyond a\nsolitary brain. To understand the full\ncapacity of humans, one needs to\nappreciate not only the memory and\ncomputational power of the brain but its\ncapacity for representing, understanding,\nand connecting with other individuals.\nThat is, one needs to recognize that we\nhave evolved a powerful, meaning\nmaking social brain.\nSocial species, by definition,\ncreate structures beyond the individual–\nstructures ranging from dyads and\nfamilies to institutions and cultures.\nThese emergent structures have evolved\nhand in hand with neural and hormonal\nmechanisms to support them because the\nconsequent social behaviors (e.g.,\ncooperation, empathy, altruism, etc.)\nhelped these organisms survive,\nreproduce, and care for offspring\nsufficiently long that they too\nreproduced. From an evolutionary\nperspective then, the social context is\nfundamental in the evolution and\ndevelopment of the human brain.\nThe observable consequences of\nthese higher organizations have long\nbeen apparent, but we are only now\nbeginning to understand their genetic,\nneural, and biochemical basis and\nconsequences. To fully delve into these\ncomplex behaviors, science needs to deal\nwith the invisible forces that shape\nhuman life, whether it is in the form of\nphysical, biological, or psychological\nforces. For instance, anthropomorphism,\nthe irrepressible proclivity to attribute\nhuman characteristics onto nonhuman\nobjects to achieve meaning,\npredictability, and human connection, is\nbeginning to be subjected to productive\nmulti-level scientific analysis.\nExperimental studies have shown that\nmanipulations which increase feelings of\nsocial isolation without the possibility of\nresolving these feelings through human\ninteraction have the compensatory effect\nof increasing people’s tendency to\nanthropomorphize, including heightened\nbeliefs in God. This scientific work has\nimplications for understanding claims\nregarding the success of religious\npractices such as solitude as paths to\nfeeling closer God. Research on\nanthropomorphism has now identified\ndevelopmental, situational, dispositional,\nand cultural factors that modulate\npeople’s tendency to anthropomorphize\nnonhuman agents ranging from\ntechnological gadgets to animals to gods,\nand the neural mechanisms underlying\nthis transconfiguration of nonhuman\nobjects into human-like agents are\nbeginning to be revealed.\nGuided by the insights from\nthese new scientific theories of\nanthropomorphism, historical analyses\nmay be worthwhile to determine whether\nconcepts of god have changed across\ntime and cultures such that god was\ncreated in the image of the believer\nrather than vice versa. Xenophanes (6th\ncentury B.C., cited in 9), for instance,\nwas apparently the first to use the term\n“anthropomorphism” when describing\nthe similarities between religious agents\nand their believers, noting that Greek\ngods were invariably fair skinned and\nblue-eyed whereas African gods were\ninvariably dark skinned and dark-eyed\n(joking that cows would surely worship\ngods that looked strikingly cow-like).\nBrain imaging research has confirmed\nPage | 15\nthat anthropomorphism is associated\nwith the activation of the same prefrontal\nareas that are active when people think\nabout themselves or project themselves\nonto others.\nConclusion\nJust as critically, the study of\ninvisible forces requires a discussion of\nthe method that successful teams use to\nwork together as they cross disciplinary\nboundaries. Over the past few decades,\nthere has been a demonstrable shift from\nthe individual genius as the source of\nscientific and scholarly breakthroughs to\ninterdisciplinary teams. This shift in the\nproduction of cutting-edge knowledge\nhas been documented in all fields of\nscholarly activity, ranging from\nmathematics and theoretical physics to\nthe humanities. This shift has both made\npossible and been necessitated by a need\nto understand complex behaviors.\nAlthough this project is primarily about\nthe ways that scientists seek to study the\nimpact of invisible forces, it will also\nreflect the methodologies that these\nresearchers use so that their work is not\nconstrained by common knowledge.\nThe philosophy of science also\nlooks different when dealing with simple\ncausality (one-to-one relations) than with\ncomplex causality. Affirmation of the\nconsequent, a logical error in which a\ngiven cause for an effect is inferred\nbased on the observation of the effect,\ndoes not lead to a scientific error when\nthere is but a single cause for the\nobserved effect. However, as scientific\ninquiry addresses increasingly complex\nphenomena, and increasingly complexly\ndetermined phenomena, the philosophy\nof science needs to become more\nnuanced.\nA core challenge is to develop a\n“science” of identification and\naggregation of these invisible forces at\ndifferent levels. Related research\nquestions include why they exist, and\nmeasures of robustness. One of our\ncentral goals is to demonstrate not only\nthat considerations of these forces\nmatter, but that that they can matter a\nlot.\nThere also are questions of value\nand ethics that could be implicated:\ndescriptive knowledge, models,\nawareness of causal relationships, and so\non, might not be enough to answer some\nkinds of questions, especially those\nrelated to value and purpose, which are\nthe very energies that animate and\ninvigorate real human systems.\nEconomics comes close with its proxy\nmeasure of value based on the\ndistribution of scarce resources and\npeople’s varying need for these\nresources. But this theory comes up\nshort in many instances where other\nvalues are at play that are beyond\nmarkets, such as in assessing the value\nof a human life, or whether all lives are\nof equal value. It is an especially poor\nmodel for helping us understand\nsomething as simple as the value of\narticles of sentimental value, such as\nfamily photographs, which may have\nlittle or no market value at all. Thus,\nhow do we best understand the\n“sentiments” that are important in the\nreal world?\nThe members of the Network\nhave worked beyond the boundaries of\ndisciplinary borders, geographical\nprecincts, and epistemological comfort\nzones to develop a rigorous but\ninnovative approach to the study of the\nhuman mind, sociality, spirituality,\nhealth, and well being.

Science can describe\nwhat religion does in rigorous ways that\nbenefit religion, and religion can serve a\nmeaning-making function that science\nitself disclaims. This is not to say that\nscience can address the existence of\nGod. Our Network instead focuses on\nthe consequences of believing in such a\nmind and of seeing into that mind.\nIn the next chapter, John\nCacioppo, a social neuroscientist, draws\non work on evolutionary theory,\nsociobiology, and evolutionary\npsychology to examine the implications\nof the selfish gene hypothesis for Homo\nsapiens. He shows how the notion of the\nselfish gene has been joined with\npolitical theory, consumerism, and\neconomics to produce a dominant\nmodern image of humans summarized\nby the phrase “what is best for me is best\nfor the society.” Without rejecting the\nselfish gene view, Cacioppo shows how\nit evolves in humans into what he calls\nthe “social brain”– a large cerebral\ncortex and an interconnected limbic\nlobule that together are sensitive to the\ncomplexities of physical and social\nenvironments. Central to this\ncomplexity is the long period of\ndependency of the human infant and the\ninterdependencies of adult humans for\nsurvival especially in hostile\nenvironments (e.g., warfare). For the\nselfish gene to contribute its DNA to the\nongoing gene pool, the individual must\nnot only reproduce but also cooperate\nwith others to assure that his or her\noffspring also grow to maturity and\nreproduce. This leads to natural\nselection choosing those genes and\ncapacities that contribute to cooperation,\nreciprocity, attachments, and generosity.\nOver the millennia of human evolution,\nthis process has created the social brain\nand made humans a unique social\nanimal.\nPage | 18\nChapter 2 2\n2 The lead author is John T. Cacioppo, Ph.D., the\nTiffany and Margaret Blake Distinguished\nService Professor in the Departments of\nPsychology and Psychiatry and the Director of\nthe Center for Cognitive and Social\nNeuroscience at the University of Chicago. He\nis a co-founder (with Gary Berntson) of the field\nof social neuroscience, a past president of the\nAssociation for Psychological Science and a\nrecipient of numerous awards including the\nNational Academy of Sciences Troland Research\nAward and the American Psychological\nAssociation Distinguished Scientific\nContribution Award. Cacioppo’s research\nconcerns the neural, hormonal, genetic, and\nbehavioral mechanisms underlying the operation\nand maintenance of the emergent structures that\ncharacterize social species generally and humans\nin particular. He has published more than 400\nscientific articles and 16 books, including\nLoneliness: Human nature and the need for\nsocial connection (2008, Norton Books) and\nHandbook of neuroscience for the behavioral\nsciences (2009, John Wiley & Sons). Cacioppo\nis also the Director of the Chicago Social Brain\nNetwork.\nCacioppo has been interested both in\nthe similarities and the differences between\nhumans and other species. Human social\ncognition, emotion, behavior, and executive\nfunctioning – that is, our social brain – are\nespecially sophisticated compared to those found\nin other species. Research in the neurosciences\nsometimes focuses so much on mechanisms\ndivorced from the social settings and functions\nthey may have evolved to serve in social species\nsuch as our own that the generalizations to\nhumans are inaccurate. Animal models permit\nexperimental control and interventions that\ncannot be carried out in humans, but\nunderstanding the implications of this work for\nthe human brain and biology depends on explicit\nThe Social Nature of Humankind\nSocial species, by definition, are\ncharacterized by the formation of structures\n(e.g., dyads, families, tribes, cultures) that\nextend beyond an individual. Although we\nmay revere the rugged individualist, we are\nfundamentally a social species. I begin by\ndiscussing some of the invisible evolutionary\nforces that led members of our species to band\ntogether to form such structures. I then\nconsider how selfish genes (e.g., through\nanthropomorphism, 1) might have led to social\nbrains and why the social connections and\nstructures created by humans are especially\npowerful and flexible. Finally, I describe a\nnonintuitive way of thinking about the\nabsence of satisfactory social connections\n(i.e., loneliness), mention how and why\nchronic loneliness can be so harmful, and\ndiscuss how our need for social connection\nmotivates us to search for meaning and\nconnections beyond ourselves and other\nindividuals. One implication that is explored\nhere, and in more detail in the essays to\nfollow, is that genetic and cultural adaptations,\nnot human ignorance, may be fueling the\nsearch for meaning and connection with a\ntranscendent entity or being.\nMythic Individualism\nFor at least the past century, we\nhave celebrated the power and\nintellectual might of the solitary genius.\nThis includes individuals such as\nThomas Edison who brought electrical\npower to individual households,\ntransforming night into day; Henry Ford\nwho introduced the mass production of\ncomparison to and knowledge of the rich\nbenefits of human social interaction and feelings\nof connection. This essay addresses this gap in\nour thinking about the genetic, neural, and\nhormonal processes that constitute our brain and\nbody and in doing so provides a different\nperspective on who we are as a unique biological\nspecies.\nPage | 19\nautomobiles, changing how we\ntransported and consequently how and\nwhere we worked and lived; Charles\nDarwin who argued that the difference in\nmind between humans and other species,\ngreat as it is, is one of degree and not of\nkind; and Albert Einstein who surmised\na relationship between energy and\nmatter, opening a universe of\npossibilities that previously was virtually\nunimaginable. As a result, the cultural\nfocus moved from a focus on the social\ngroup – the family, neighborhood, or\nsociety – toward the autonomous\nindividual.\nForty years ago, the dominant\nmetaphor for the human mind was the\ndigital computer, complete with inputs,\nfiling and memory systems, limited\nprocessing resources, and outputs.\nEvolutionary theory focused on the\nselfish gene and, by extension, on the\nindividual whose purpose for living was\nto survive long enough to reproduce.\nMilton Friedman influenced economic\ntheory and government policies for\ndecades by positing that people, being\nfundamentally rational, are motivated\nfirst and foremost by self interests, and\nthe adage of “united we stand, divided\nwe fall” was supplanted by the notion\nthat what is best for the me is best for the\nsociety. Moving from an economy\nbased on manufacturing for the masses\nto one based on catering to idiosyncratic\nconsumer interests further fueled a focus\non the preferences of the autonomous\nindividual.\nOne can certainly find evidence\nin humans and other species for the view\nof life being best understood in terms of\nself-interest. Sardines, for example,\nswim in what appears to be synchronized\nschools until approached by a predator,\nat which time they dart about so\nchaotically that they create what appears\nto be a large, tumultuous ball with a\nmind of its own. The rule governing the\nbehavior of this dynamic and adaptive\ncollective action can be explained\nentirely in terms of self-interests. Each\nfish is driven to swim to the middle,\nwhere it is less likely to be eaten by the\nhungry predator. Sardines are born with\nthe capacity to swim, find food, and\navoid predators. If they survive long\nenough to reproduce, their genes will be\npart of the gene pool for future\ngenerations. That is, if those who are\ngenetically predisposed to swim to the\nmiddle are more likely to survive\npredation, then the genetic\npredisposition to swim to the middle will\nbecome a characteristic of a larger\npercentage of sardines in future\ngenerations.\nThe sardine ball is an example of\na more general phenomenon, in which\nthe choices made by members of a group\nendow the collective with properties that\nare consistent, predictable, and\npurposive enough that we can speak of\nthem as “behaviors” of the group, even\nthough the collective actions of the\ngroup are not directed by any of the\nindividual members. This phenomenon\ncan be called “emergent,” because the\nproperties or behavior of the group are\nnot determined by any individual but\narises from the collective behaviors of\nthe individuals who constitute the group.\nSocial structures like the sardine ball\nhave evolved because the sardines\nwhose genes compelled them to swim to\nthe middle in the presence of predators\nwere more likely to survive to\nreproduce, thereby contributing these\ngenes to this species’ gene pool.\nAccording to the National\nScience Foundation’s Tree of Life\nproject, there are anywhere between 5\nmillion and 100 million species on\nPage | 20\nEarth, only 2 million of which have been\nidentified thus far. Most of the species\nidentified are either born with the\ncapacity to find sustenance and avoid\npredation sufficiently well that some\nsurvive long enough to reproduce, or\nthey are born in such large numbers that\nsome survive long enough to reproduce.\nIt is the ability of such organisms to\nreproduce that determines what genes\nconstitute the gene pool for the future\ngenerations of that species. These genes,\nin turn, shape the structure and function\nof the organisms that constitute a\nspecies. This reasoning led George\nWilliams (2) to suggest a half century\nago that traits (i.e., behavioral\ntendencies) which benefit the group at\nthe expense of the individual would\nevolve only if the process of groupselection\nwas great enough to overcome\nselection within groups. He further\nsuggested that group selection is nearly\nalways weak, so that group-related\nadaptations do not exist (3). Richard\nDawkins (1) popularized the notion that\ntraits which evolve are adaptive at the\ngene level through his use of the\nmetaphor of the selfish gene. Genes\nserve their own selfish interests in the\nsense that whatever the contributions\nmade by a gene, or set of genes, to an\norganism’s structure and function would\nbe passed on to the next generation if\nand only if the gene made its way to the\ngene pool. Survival of the fittest now\nhad a biological basis.\nUnited We Stand, Divided We Fall\nCharles Darwin did not know\nthat genes were the mechanism through\nwhich structures and behaviors evolved,\nbut an important component of his\noriginal theory was the notion of\nsurvival of the fittest. Darwin was also\npuzzled by the observation that many\nindividual organisms made themselves\nless fit so that the group might survive.\nSubsequent generations of evolutionary\nbiologists realized that even though\ngenes might act as if selfish, the vehicle\nresponsible for the transport of these\ngenes to the gene pool occasionally\nextended beyond the individual or parent\nto kin and even to unrelated members of\ngroups. More specifically, in some cases\nthe superorganismal structures formed\nby social organisms represent naturally\nselected levels of organization above\nindividual organisms (4).\nConsider the example of the\nEmperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri).\nEmperor penguins typically reside near\ntheir food source of squid, shoaling fish,\nand small crustaceans but in early winter\nthey gather into breeding colonies\n(rookeries) up to 60 miles inland in April\nand May during the Antarctic winter.\nThey search for their mate from the\nprevious year, and go through a\ncourtship ritual before mating. The\nfemale lays only one egg in May or\nJune, which coincides with the start of\nthe bitter Antarctica winter. The\nEmperor penguins are thought to have\ndeveloped this unusual winter breeding\nbehavior to permit the chick to grow to\nindependence the following summer,\nwhen food is plentiful. Ensuring the\nchick survives that long is a collective\nenterprise, with the vehicle responsible\nfor the chick surviving long enough such\nthat it too can reproduce not being solely\nthe mother or the father but also the\nhuddle.\nThe birthing of the egg leaves the\nmother depleted, so she must return to\nthe seaside to feed while the father\nassumes responsibility for the incubation\nof the egg during the winter. An egg\nfrom an Emperor penguin will quickly\nfreeze if left exposed to harsh winter\nconditions of the Antarctica, so the\nPage | 21\ntransition of the egg from beneath the\nwarmth and safety of the mother to atop\nthe feet and under a fold of feathered\nabdominal skin of the father requires a\nbit of coordination on the part of the\ntwo. Even this is not sufficient for the\ngenes of this pair to find their way into\nthe gene pool. The conditions of the\nAntarctic winters are among the least\nhospitable on earth, with winter\ntemperatures dipping below -60 degrees\nCelsius and winds reaching 120 mph.\nTo protect themselves from the wind and\ncold, the male penguins huddle together,\nspending much of their time sleeping to\nconserve energy. In this harsh\nenvironment, survival of the chicks\ndepends on the shared warmth and\nprotection of the huddle, not the\nindividual. The group as a whole is\nmore likely to survive if each penguin\nand chick shares in the warmth and\nprotection of the collective structure,\nwhich means selective pressures exist to\npromote cooperation to maintain the\nintegrity of the huddle. More generally,\nfor species born to a period of utter\ndependency, the genes that find their\nway into the gene pool are not defined\nsolely or even mostly by likelihood that\nan organism will reproduce but by the\nlikelihood that the offspring of the parent\nwill live long enough to reproduce. As\nin the case of the Emperor penguins, one\nconsequence is that selfish genes\nevolved through individual-level\nselection processes to promote social\npreferences and group processes,\nincluding reciprocal social behaviors,\nthat can extend beyond kin relationships\n(e.g., 5). Examples of such selection\nprocesses in humans exist, as well (e.g.,\n6, 7).\nThe environmental challenges\nfacing Emperor penguins, as daunting as\nthey are, pale by comparison to the\ncomplexities facing the human species.\nIndeed, the social brain hypothesis posits\nthat the social complexities and demands\nof primate species contributed to the\nrapid increase in neocortical (i.e., the\nouter layer of the brain) connectivity and\nintelligence (8). Warfare among\nancestral hunter-gatherers appears to\nhave contributed to group selection for\nhuman social behaviors, especially\naltruistic behaviors (5). As Darwin\n(1871) noted:\nA tribe including many members\nwho, from possessing a high\ndegree of the spirit of patriotism,\nfidelity, obedience, courage, and\nsympathy, were always ready to\naid one another, and to sacrifice\nthemselves for the common good\nwould be victorious over most\nother tribes; and this would be\nnatural selection. (p. 166)\nMoreover, deducing better ways\nto find food, avoid perils, and navigate\nterritories has adaptive value for large\nmammals, but the complexities of these\necological demands are no match for the\ncomplexities of social living (especially\nin hostile between-group social\nenvironments), which include:\nrecognizing ingroup and outgroup\nmembers; learning by social observation;\nrecognizing the shifting status of friends\nand foes; anticipating and coordinating\nefforts between two or more individuals;\nusing language to communicate, reason,\nteach, and deceive others; orchestrating\nrelationships, ranging from pair bonds\nand families to friends, bands, and\ncoalitions; navigating complex social\nhierarchies, social norms and cultural\ndevelopments; subjugating self-interests\nto the interests of the pair bond or social\ngroup in exchange for the possibility of\nlong term benefits for oneself or one’s\ngroup; recruiting support to sanction\nPage | 22\nindividuals who violate group norms;\nand doing all this across time frames that\nstretch from the distant past to multiple\npossible futures (9). Consistent with\nthis hypothesis, measures of sociality in\ntroops of baboons have been found to be\nhighly correlated with infant survival,\nand cross-species comparisons have\nshown that the evolution of large and\nmetabolically expensive brains is more\nclosely associated with social than\necological complexity (9).\nOur survival depends on our\nconnection with others. Born to the\nmost prolonged period of utter\ndependency of any animal, human\ninfants must instantly engage their\nparents in protective behavior, and the\nparents must care enough about their\noffspring to nurture and protect them. If\ninfants do not elicit nurturance and\nprotection from caregivers, or if\ncaregivers are not motivated to provide\nsuch care over an extended period of\ntime, then the infants will perish along\nwith the genetic legacy of the parents\n(10). Our developmental dependency\nmirrors our evolutionary heritage.\nHunter/gatherers did not have the benefit\nof natural weaponry, armor, strength,\nflight, stealth, or speed relative to many\nother species. Human survival depended\non collective abilities, not on individual\nmight.\nSelfish Genes, Social Brains\nIt is the gene that is obligatorily\nselfish, not the human brain. Genes that\npromote behaviors that increase the odds\nof the genes surviving are perpetuated.\nOne implication of this simple insight is\nthat evolution can be viewed as the\ncompetition between genes using\nindividuals and social structures as their\ntemporary vehicles. The genetic\nconstitution of Homo Sapiens in the long\nrun derives not solely from the\nreproductive success of individuals, but\nalso from the success of their children to\nreproduce. Hunter/gatherers who did not\nform social connections and who did not\nfeel a compulsion to return to share their\nfood or defense with their offspring may\nhave been more likely to survive to\nprocreate again, but given the long\nperiod of dependency of human infants\ntheir offspring may have been less likely\nto survive to procreate. The result is\nselection that strongly favors the ability\nto process information that could\ncontribute to the formation and\nmaintenance of social capacities and\nconnections – that is, a social brain.\nThese social capacities evolved hand in\nhand with genetic, neural, and hormonal\nmechanisms to support them because the\nresulting social behaviors helped humans\nsurvive, reproduce, and care for\noffspring sufficiently long that they too\nsurvived to reproduce (11-13). Relative\nto other animals, the striking\ndevelopment of and increased\nconnectivity within the human cerebral\ncortex, especially the frontal and\ntemporal regions, are among the key\nevolutionary developments in this\nregard. The cerebral cortex is a mantle\nof between 2.6 to 16 billion neurons with\neach neuron receiving 10,000 to 100,000\nsynapses in their dendritic trees (e.g.,\n14). The expansion of the frontal\nregions in the human brain contributes to\nthe human capacities for reasoning,\nplanning, performing mental\nsimulations, theory of mind, and\nthinking about self and others. The\ntemporal regions of the brain, in turn, are\ninvolved with aspects of social\nperception, memory, and\ncommunication. The means for guiding\nbehavior through the environment\nemerged prior to neocortical expansion.\nPage | 23\nThe evolutionarily older systems also\nplay a role in human information\nprocessing and behavior, albeit in a more\nrigid and stereotyped fashion. The\nintricately interconnected neocortical\nregions of the frontal lobes are involved\nin self control, which permits the\nmodulation of these older systems and\nthe overriding of organismal hedonistic\nimpulses for the benefit of others (15).\nEvidence across human history\nprovides overwhelming support for the\nsupposition that humans are\nfundamentally social creatures (13).\nEven in contemporary times in which\nautonomy is revered, the average person\nhas been estimated to spend nearly 80%\nof waking hours in the company of\nothers, most of which is spent in small\ntalk with known individuals (16). These\nestimates have been supported in more\ndetailed assessment using the dayreconstruction\nmethod to determine how\npeople spend their time and how they\nexperienced events in their lives on a\ndaily basis (17). The results of these\ndaily assessments indicate people spend\nonly 3.4 hrs alone, or approximately\n20% of their waking hours. The time\nspent with friends, relatives, spouse,\nchildren, clients, and coworkers is rated\non average as more inherently rewarding\nthan the time spent alone (17).\nRespondents indicate that their\nmost enjoyable activities are intimate\nrelations and socializing – activities that\npromote bonding and high quality\nrelationships, whereas their least\nenjoyable activities are commuting and\nworking. These results are consistent\nwith survey data. When asked “what is\nnecessary for happiness?” the majority\nof respondents rate “relationships with\nfamily and friends” as most important\n(18), although we certainly do not\nalways act like this is most important. It\nis surprisingly easy to overlook the\nevident.\nNoticing the Unusual, Overlooking the\nObvious\nOn January 15, 2009, US\nAirways Flight 1549 departed from New\nYork’s LaGuardia Airport for Charlotte,\nNorth Carolina when it struck a flock of\ngeese during takeoff. Both engines were\ndisabled, and the heavy aircraft quickly\nlost the power it needed to stay aloft, but\nCapt. Chesley Sullenberger somehow\nmanaged a controlled descent into the\nHudson River. The media dubbed the\nditching of the plane and the survival of\nall 155 passengers and crew the miracle\non the Hudson, and Sullenberger was\nduly heralded as a hero. The ability to\ncontrol the descent of an 84-ton plane\nwithout engine thrust is not something\nwith which humans are naturally\nendowed. Sullenberger was not a\nnovice, of course. He is a U.S. Air\nForce Academy graduate who flew F-4\nfighter planes while in the Air Force, has\n40 years of flight experience, and holds a\ncommercial glider license and glider\ninstructor rating. As remarkable as was\nhis achievement relative to what one\nmight normally expect in this situation,\nhowever, Sullenberger’s efforts were not\nsufficient for the miracle on the Hudson\nto be achieved.\nWhen Flight 1549 came to a stop\nin the frigid Hudson River, the\npassengers and crew scrambled to the\nwings and inflatable slides of their\nslowly sinking aircraft. Local\ncommercial vessels from the New York\nWaterway and Circle Line fleets\nresponded almost immediately, with the\nfirst of the vessels reaching the plane\nwithin four minutes. The crews of the\nvarious vessels worked together to\nrescue the passengers and crew of Flight\nPage | 24\n1549, and various volunteers and\nagencies offered medical assistance.\nThese rescue efforts were not motivated\nby personal or commercial self-interests,\nand none of the commercial vessel\ncaptains was lauded as a hero. Their\nefforts received less attention because\ntheir actions were precisely what we\nexpect of one another.\nIt is the unusual, not the\ncommonplace, that is noticed. On\nMarch 13, 1964, Kitty Genovese parked\nnear her home in Kew Gardens, New\nYork, and proceeded to her residence in\na small apartment complex. Winston\nMoseley, a business machine operator\nwho later confessed that his motive was\nsimply to kill a woman, overtook\nGenovese and stabbed her twice in the\nback. Genovese screamed, “Oh my\nGod, he stabbed me! Help me!”, a call\nthat was heard by neighbors. When one\nneighbor shouted at the attacker, “Leave\nthat girl alone,” Moseley ran away.\nGenovese, who was wounded and\nbleeding, moved toward the apartment\nbuilding slowly and alone. Moseley\nreturned approximately 10 minutes later\nand searched for Genovese. Finding her\nnearly unconscious in a hallway of the\nbuilding, he continued his knife attack\non her and sexually assaulted her. The\nentire attack unfolded over about half an\nhour, and yet no one responded. The\nfirst clear call for help to the police did\nnot occur until minutes following the\nfinal attack, and Genovese died in an\nambulance en route to the hospital. The\nnumber of people who were aware of\nsome aspect of the attack was estimated\nto be from a dozen to more than three\ndozen. One unidentified neighbor who\nsaw part of the attack was quoted in a\nNew York Times article as saying “I\ndidn’t want to get involved.” (19). The\nnotion that people might not go to the\naid of another, even a stranger, in dire\nneed led to public outrage. Decades of\nresearch led to the conclusion that the\nambiguity of the situation and the\ndiffusion of responsibility were\ncontributing factors.\nThese two news stories illustrate,\nin very different ways, how invisible\nforces sculpted by evolution and\ncultivated by the environment act on our\nspecies. When commercial boat captains\nact against their own financial interests\nto rescue others on a sinking aircraft, we\nthink nothing of it because we believe it\nis what any individual in the same\nsituation would naturally do. When\nobservers of a brutal attack do nothing to\naid the victim, we are horrified because\nwe believe it goes against who we are as\na species. Humans are not motivated\nsolely by self interests but rather we\nwork together and help one another\nwhen in need. We survive and prosper\nin the long term through collective\nconcerns and actions, not by solely\nselfish pursuits (20).\nDanger Signals\nThe stories of the sardine ball\nand the penguin huddle suggest that it is\ndangerous to be on the social perimeter.\nLiving on the perimeter threatens the\nlives and genetic legacy of humans, as\nwell. Epidemiological studies have\nfound that social isolation is not only\nassociated with lower levels of\nhappiness and well being but with broad\nbased morbidity and mortality (21).\nMoreover, humans are such meaningmaking\ncreatures that perceived social\nisolation is at least as important a\npredictor of adverse outcomes on human\nhealth and well being as is objective\nsocial isolation (22). Writers may spend\nlong periods by themselves, but the\nenvisioned readers make this time feel\nPage | 25\nanything but isolated. High school\ngraduates who leave family and friends\nfor the first time to attend college, on the\nother hand, typically experience intense\nfeelings of social isolation even though\nthey are physically around more people\nthan before they left home. Caspi and\ncolleagues (23) found that perceived\nsocial isolation in adolescence and\nyoung adulthood predicted how many\ncardiovascular risk factors (e.g., body\nmass index, waist circumference, blood\npressure, cholesterol) were elevated in\nyoung adulthood, and that the number of\ndevelopmental occasions (i.e.,\nchildhood, adolescence, young\nadulthood) at which participants felt\nsocially isolated predicted the number of\nelevated risk factors in young adulthood.\nPerceived social isolation is\nknown more colloquially as loneliness,\nwhich in early scientific investigations\nwas depicted as “a chronic distress\nwithout redeeming features” (24, p. 15).\nLoneliness may feel like a painfully\nmiserable, hopeless, and worthless state,\nbut we have found it has a specific\nstructure and a valuable adaptive\nfunction.\nResearch on the ways in which\npeople describe themselves when asked\nthe question, “Who are you?”, reveals\nthree basic dimensions (25): (1) a\npersonal, or intimate, self, the “you” of\nyour individual characteristics; (2) a\nsocial or relational self, which is who\nyou are in relation to the people closest\nto you—your spouse, kids, friends, and\nneighbors; and (3) a collective self, the\nyou that is the member of a certain\nethnic group, has a certain national\nidentity, belongs to certain professional\nor other associations, and a member of\nthe fan club for certain sports teams.\nSimilar to the relational self, this part of\nthe self is social but what makes this self\ndistinct is that these are broader social\nidentities, linked to larger social groups\nrather than individual members of the\ngroups. When we examined the\ndimensions underlying loneliness/social\nconnectedness, we found the same three\nbasic dimensions (26): (1) intimate\nconnection/isolation refers to the\nperceived presence/absence of anyone in\nyour life who affirms you as a valued\nperson; (2) relational\nconnection/isolation refers to the\nperceived presence/absence of quality\nfriendships or family connections; and\n(3) collective connection/isolation refers\nto the perceived presence/absence of a\nmeaningful connection with a group or\nsocial stimulus (e.g., school, team)\nbeyond other individuals. When you\nperceive you are part of a valued group\n(collective connection), for instance, you\nmay be more inclined to agree with other\ngroup members, even on beliefs that\nmay seem irrational, than when you are\nthinking of yourself as a unique\nindividual.\nGiven that human survival and\nprosperity depends on inclusion in and\nparticipation with a social group,\nespecially in evolutionary time when\nfood was scarce and dangers were\ncommon, there is an adaptive benefit to\nhaving the strong and aversive response\nof loneliness when an individual feels\nhis or her social connections might be\nweakening or broken, just as there is a\nbenefit to having aversive signals for\nother conditions critical for survival.\nHunger, thirst, and pain have evolved as\naversive signals to prompt an organism\nto change their behavior in a way that\nprotects the individual and promotes the\nlikelihood their genes will make their\nway into the gene pool. The social pain\nof loneliness has evolved similarly – to\nserve as a signal that one’s connections\nPage | 26\nto others are weakening and to motivate\nthe repair and maintenance of the\nconnections to others that are needed for\nour health and well being as for the\nsurvival of our genes (27). Physical pain\nis an aversive signal that evolved to\nmotivate one to take action that\nminimizes damage to one’s body.\nLoneliness is an aversive signal that\nevolved to motivate one to take action\nthat minimizes damage to one’s social\nbody.\nPeople differ dispositionally in\ntheir sensitivity to the pain of social\ndisconnection (i.e., feelings of\nloneliness; 28) just as people differ in\nsensitivity to physical pain. Ostracism\nor objective isolation in most species is\nassociated with an early death (29). In\nhumans, the chronic feeling of social\nisolation, even when the person remains\namong the protective embrace of others,\nis associated with significant mental and\nphysical disorders (30). Chronic hunger,\nthirst, and pain can also have deleterious\neffects for, like loneliness, their adaptive\nvalue lies in their effects as acute\nsignals, not as chronic conditions. The\nopposite of feeling hunger, thirst, pain,\nor loneliness is feeling normal, and this\nis the state in which most people exist\nmost of the time.\nThe social connections formed\nby humans need not be based on genetic\nsimilarities. The human species has\nevolved the capacity for and motivation\nto form relationships not only with other\nindividuals but also with groups (e.g., a\nChicago Cubs or Boston Red Sox fan)\nand nonhuman entities (e.g., through\nanthropomorphism, 31). Team spirit and\nschool spirit are familiar notions, and\nalthough team or school spirit refers to\nan invisible influence, it is an invisible\ninfluence that is no less open to rigorous\nscientific inquiry than are the invisible\ninfluences of gravity or magnetic flux.\nIn the cases of team and school spirit,\nthis influence represents a specific form\nof social connection between an\nindividual and an emergent structure.\nPerceived social connections are\nabstractions that can transcend time and\nspace. People may feel a connection\nwith their ancestors or family heritage\neven if they are the only remaining\ndescendant, just as people can perceive\npersonal connections with pets, cars,\ntelevision characters, celebrities, and\nunseen spiritual entities with whom they\ndo not actually interact. A potent\ncomponent of spirituality (that does not\ndepend on a specific religion) is the\nfeeling of connection and purpose that\ncome from forming a relationship with a\nhigher being. A simple byproduct of our\nselfish genes and social brains may be\nour search for meaning in and\nconnection with broader organizations or\nbeings.\nConclusion\nIn 1939, the astrophysicist Sir Arthur\nEddington published a book entitled The\nphilosophy of physical science (32). In it he\ndescribes a hypothetical scientist who sought\nto determine the size of the various fish in the\nsea. The scientist began by weaving a 2-inch\nmesh net and setting sail across the seas,\nrepeatedly sampling catches and carefully\nmeasuring, recording, and analyzing the\nresults of each catch. After extensive\nsampling, the scientist concluded that there\nwere no fish smaller than two inches in the\nsea. The moral of Sir Eddington's analogy is\ntwofold. First, scientific instruments are\nshaped by people’s intuitive theories of the\nphenomena to be investigated. Second, once\ndeveloped, scientific expectations and\ninstruments shape data and theory in ways\nmore powerfully and fundamentally than are\noften appreciated.\nPage | 27\nWhat is the relevance of this to the\nstory of the social nature of humankind? Our\nresearch findings have led me to believe that\nwe all have made Eddington’s error in the way\nwe have thought about, studied, and tried to\ndeal with an invisible force that motivates us\nto seek and maintain our connection with\nothers – including the loneliness one feels\nwhen we feel important social connections are\nthreatened or absent. Historically, the\nscientific perspective on loneliness was not\nonly that it was a painful and miserable state,\nbut that it was an aversive state with no\nredeeming features. All one needs to do is to\nreflect on the last time one felt terribly lonely,\nand one can appreciate the seemingly selfevident\ntruth of this characterization. But as\nSir Arthur Eddington’s story shows us, the\nobvious and intuitive can sometimes be very\nmisleading. It is now widely recognized that\nmany structures and processes of the mind\noperate outside of awareness, with only the\nend products sometimes reaching awareness.\nHumans have evolved to seek\nconnections with and validation from\nother minds, and these social\nconnections represent an important set of\ninvisible forces operating on our brain\nand biology. The need for social\nconnection extends beyond kin relations\nand beyond face to face relations to\ninclude felt connections with\nsuperorganismal entities such as teams,\npolitical parties, nations, and God. The\nunseen forces compelling these\nconnections can be quantified and\ninvestigated objectively independent of\none’s spiritual beliefs. Underlying these\naspirations are selfish genes that have\nproduced a social brain which activates\nreward regions of the brain when we\ncooperate effectively with others (33) or\npunish the perpetrators of social\nexploitations (34), and which activates\nthe pain matrix in the brain when we feel\nrejected by others (35). When people\nfeel socially isolated (i.e., lonely)\ncompared to when they do not feel\nlonely, they are more likely not only to\nperceive nonhuman objects as humanlike\nbut to believe in the existence of\nGod (31, 36). To understand the full\ncapacity of and forces operating on\nhumans, we need to appreciate not only\nthe memory and computational power of\nthe brain but its capacity for\nrepresenting, understanding, and\nconnecting with other individuals and\nwith the emergent structures, fictional\nand real, that the brain can represent.\nThat is, we need to recognize that we\nhave evolved a powerful, meaningmaking\nsocial brain and a need for social\nconnection.\nReferences\n1.

Not long\nafterwards, an article appeared in\nScience that presented evidence that the\nmost vicious members of a warlike tribe\nin South America had the most wives\nand children. The underlying notion was\none of (genetic) survival of the fittest:\nThose warriors who were particularly\nvicious were more likely to contribute\ntheir genes to the gene pool.\nMethodological objections have left this\nan open question, however, and new\nevidence now exists that calls this\ninterpretation into question (1): the most\naggressive warriors may have more\nchildren but they have lower indices of\nreproductive success than their milder\nbrethren in part perhaps because the\nmost aggressive warriors and their\noffspring are also more likely to be the\ntargets of revenge killings. These new\ndata are entirely consistent with John\nCacioppo’s argument that the content of\nthe human gene pool has more to do\nwith the reproductive success of one’s\noffspring than one’s own reproductive\nsuccess. Cacioppo argued further that\nthis genetic selection resulted in a social\nbrain that seeks meaning and connection\nwith individuals and with social entities\n(e.g., groups) that extend beyond other\nindividuals.\nIn the next chapter, theologian\nDon Browning also embraces the\nconcept of inclusive fitness and, through\nthe writings of Thomas Aquinas, shows\nhow religion serves the human need for\nmeaning and connection through the\nethics they advocate, the congregations\nthey form, the institutions they represent,\nand the God they serve. In his view,\nreligion serves to extend love and\nconnection beyond kin. He further\nargues that new developments in the\nsciences and long-standing traditions in\ntheology constitute fertile ground on\nwhich to build new and testable\nhypotheses regarding our fundamental\nhuman nature.\n1. S. Beckerman et al., Proc. Natl.\nAcad. Sci. U. S. A. 106, 8134\n(May 19, 2009).\nPage | 31\nChapter 3 3\nScience, Religion, and a Revived\nReligious Humanism\nFor over 150 years there has been\na vital, and often contentious, dialogue\nbetween science and religion. In recent\n3\nThe lead author is Don Browning, Ph.D., the\nAlexander Campbell Professor of Religious\nEthics and the Social Sciences, Emeritus,\nDivinity School, University of Chicago. He has\ninterests in the relation of the social sciences to\nreligious ethics for the purpose of addressing\nvarious challenges facing modern life. His books\ninclude Generative Man (1973, 1975; National\nBook Award Finalist, 1974), Religious Thought\nand the Modern Psychologies (1987, 2004), the\nco-authored From Culture Wars to Common\nGround: Religion and the American Family\nDebate (1997, 2000), Christian Ethics and the\nMoral Psychologies (2006), and Equality and the\nFamily (2007). He co-edited Sex, Marriage, and\nFamily in the World Religions (2006), American\nReligions and the Family (2006), Children and\nChildhood in American Religions (2009), and\nChildren and Childhood in World Religions\n(2009). He is the co-principal investigator with\nJean Bethke Elshtain of a Templeton Foundation\nfunded $4,000,000 New Science of Virtue\nproject.\nIn this essay, Browning acknowledges\nthe antagonistic relationship that can be found\nbetween science and religion, but he proposes\nthat the dialogue between science and religion\ncan now be conducted on philosophical grounds\nthat promote a new religious humanism that will\nhonor the core ideas of the great religions, refine\ntheir view of nature, and increase the values of\nhealth, wealth, education, and general wellbeing.\nyears, new energy and fresh public\ninterest have been injected into this\nconversation. This largely has come\nabout due to the new insights into\nreligion and ethics achieved by\ncollaboration between evolutionary\npsychology and cognitive and social\nneuroscience.\nWhat are the likely social\nconsequences of this new interest in the\nrelation of science and religion? There\nare at least three possible answers. One\nmight be the new atheism exemplified\nby the writings of Richard Dawkins,\nDaniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and\nChristopher Hitchens. 1 In this approach,\nthe alleged defective thinking of the\nworld religions is exposed, and a\nworldview and way of life based strictly\non science are offered as replacement. A\nsecond option might be the return of a\nhegemonic dominance of religion over\nscience. However, polarizing rhetoric\nfrom advocates for the exclusive\ninterpretive priority of either science or\nreligion has long since ceased to be\nculturally or academically productive.\nInstead, through dialogue about common\nissues, scientific and theological thinkers\nmay pose questions that lead to more\nsophisticated inquiry in both fields.\nConfidence in the productive\npossibilities of reciprocal questioning is\na hallmark of the long tradition known\nas religious humanism. Here I illustrate\nthe potential contribution of religious\nhumanism by bringing recent\npsychological research into dialogue\nwith the religious concept of love.\nWhat would this religious\nhumanism be like? The major world\nreligions would remain visible and\nviable as religious movements. But the\ncontributions of science would help\nthese religions refine their interests in\nimproving the health, education, wealth,\nPage | 32\nand overall well-being of their adherents.\nIn addition, the sciences would help\nthem refine their grasp of the empirical\nworld about which they are, like humans\nin general, constantly making judgments,\npredictions, and characterizations. In\nmy vision, the attitude of scientists\ntoward religion would be first of all\nphenomenological; they would first\nattempt to describe and understand\nreligious beliefs, ethics, and rituals in\ntheir full historical context. But their\ninterest in explaining some of the\nconditions that give rise to religious\nphenomena would not be inhibited by\neither religion or the wider society.\nThere are several different approaches to\nphenomenology. The perspective that I\nrecommend follows the “critical\nhermeneutic phenomenology” of Paul\nRicoeur. Ricoeur advocates beginning\nthe study of religion with a\nphenomenology – a careful description –\nof the person’s or community’s words,\nsymbols, metaphors, and narratives used\nto communicate the meaning of a\nreligious experience or practice. This\nview assumes that we cannot describe\nexperience directly but rather that\nexperience is always mediated by\nsymbols and metaphors. But Ricoeur’s\nphenomenology does not stop with a\ndescription of these meanings. It builds\nin a secondary place for science and\nexplanation. It seeks through science to\ngive explanatory accounts of the affects\nand motivations that humans bring to\nthese words, symbols, and metaphors. If\nscientists followed Ricoeur’s model,\nthey would understand the importance of\nbeginning with description, be hesitant\nto skip lightly over initial\nphenomenological meanings, appreciate\nyet grasp the limits of explanation, and\nbe reluctant to plunge into speculations,\nsuch as those of the new scientific\natheism, about the ultimate truth or\nfalsity of religious phenomena. 2\nOn the other hand, the religions\nthemselves can contribute to the\nsciences. They can do this by offering\nhypotheses about how social and\nreligious ideas, behaviors, and rituals\ncan shape experience, even neural\nprocesses, often for the good but\nsometimes not. The religions can offer a\nmore generous epistemology and\nontology than science is inclined to find\nuseful for the tight explanatory interests\nof the laboratory or scientific survey.\nThis too might generate new hypotheses\nfor scientific investigation. These would\nbe some of the ground rules for how a\ndialogue between science and religion\nmight stimulate a revived religious\nhumanism.\nReligious Humanisms of the Past\nTo speak of a revival suggests\nthat there have been many expressions of\nreligious humanism in the past when\nsome form of science, philosophy, and\nreligion creatively interacted. I will\nlimit myself to speaking primarily about\nJudaism, Christianity, and Islam. A\nsynthesis between Greek philosophical\npsychology and Christianity can be\nfound in the use of Stoic theories of\ndesire by the apostle Paul, 3 the presence\nof Aristotle’s family ethic – with its\nimplicit psycho-biology - in the\nhousehold codes of Ephesians and I\nColossians, 4 and the gospel of John’s\nidentification of Jesus with the Platonic\nand Stoic idea of the pre-existent\n“Word.” 5 A more intentional religious\nhumanism can be found in Augustine’s\nuse of the neo-Platonic Plotinus,\nespecially in the philosophical\npsychology of remembrance developed\nin his Confessions. 6 But the most\ndramatic example of a religious\nPage | 33\nhumanism that spread simultaneously\ninto Judaism, Christianity, and Islam can\nbe found when the lost texts of Aristotle\nwere discovered, translated, and\nappropriated by scholars from these\nthree religions who worked at the same\ntables in Islamic libraries in Spain and\nSicily during the ninth and tenth\ncenturies. Richard Rubinstein in his\ntimely book titled Aristotle’s Children\n(2003) tells the story well. 7 This gave\nrise to forms of Aristotelian religious\nhumanism in the works of Thomas\nAquinas in Christianity, Maimonides in\nJudaism, and Averroës in Islam. On the\nAmerican scene, one sees another form\nof Christian humanism in the synthesis\nof philosophical pragmatism, with all its\ninfluence from Darwin, and expressions\nof liberal Christianity and the social\ngospel movement. 8\nReligious humanisms have not\nalways flourished and are subject to\nattacks from both fundamentalists and\nscientific secularists. They need\nconstant updating and vigorous\nintellectual development. But at their\nbest, they make it possible for societies\nto maintain strong religious communities\nas well as integrating symbolic\numbrellas that protect the productive\ninteraction of the scientific disciplines\nwith the wider cultural and religious life.\nAn Example: The Agape, Caritas, and\nEros Debate\nFew words in the English\nlanguage have such a range of everyday\nmeanings and of serious philosophical\nand theological consideration as the\nword love. For this reason, it is an\nexcellent candidate for scientific\ninvestigation that has potential benefits\nfor religious practice and everyday life.\nAlthough some theologians have sought\nto create a sharp division between\n\"Christian love\" and all other forms of\nlove, the tradition of religious humanism\nproposes that science clarifies the\nworkings of love in human societies and\nreligion extends the scope of love\nbeyond its most immediate domain of\nkinship.\nThere are three major tensions in\ntheological discussions of Christian love.\nThey center around the two Greek words\nagape and eros and the Latin word\ncaritas. A famous book titled Agape\nand Eros (1953) written by the Swedish\ntheologian Anders Nygren traced the\ndebate through Christian history. 9\nNygren believed that the truly normative\nand authentic understanding of Christian\nlove is found in the word agape, the\nGreek word used for Christian love in\nthe New Testament. It refers to a kind of\nself-giving, even self-sacrificial, love\nthat is only possible by the grace of God.\n10 Nygren was particularly interested in\narguing that Christian love did not build\non what the Greek philosophers called\neros. He claimed eros refers to the\nnatural desires of humans to have and\nunite with the goods of life. This\nincludes the goods of health, wealth,\naffiliation, and pleasure but it also\nincludes the higher goods of beauty and\ntruth. Nygren’s point, however, was\nthat Christian love does not build on or\nincorporate eros – the natural\naspirational strivings of humans. He\nbelieved he found this view of Christian\nlove in the New Testament (especially\nthe writing of the apostle Paul) and\nMartin Luther, the giant of the Protestant\nReformation.\nNygren was particularly\ninterested in dismantling the classical\nmedieval Roman Catholic view of\nChristian love that was often\nsummarized with the English word\ncharity or the Latin word caritas. Why\nPage | 34\ndid Nygren oppose the caritas view of\nChristian love? The answer is that the\nmeaning of love as caritas did exactly\nwhat Nygren thought Paul and Luther,\nhis theological heroes, did not do. In the\nclassic Roman Catholic view, love as\ncaritas builds on eros. Caritas was seen\nto include natural desires for health and\naffiliation. But the caritas view of love\nalso held that religious education and\nGod’s grace built on and expanded these\nnatural inclinations to entail a self-giving\nbenevolence to others, even strangers\nand enemies – an idea so central to the\nconcept of Christian love.\nAll of this seemed too\nnaturalistic for Nygren. It seemed to\nplay down the importance of God’s\ntransforming grace. He joined other\nEuropean neo-orthodox theologians of\nhis day such as Karl Barth and Rudolph\nBultmann in cutting off Christian love\nfrom eros, 11 which in effect was to cut\nChristian love from nature and desire –\nthe very things scientists tend to study.\nBeginning with Nygren’s strong view of\nagape and the strong supernaturalism of\nboth Nygren and Barth, there was little\nroom in these mid-twentieth century\nProtestant trends for a productive\ndialogue between Christian ethics and\nthe new scientific advances in moral\npsychology, evolutionary psychology,\nand neuroscience.\nAt the same time, however,\nbreakthroughs in these very disciplines\nhave led to a new reassessment of the\nCatholic caritas model of Christian love.\nBut before I review in more detail how\nthis model worked, especially in the\nthought of the great medieval Roman\nCatholic theologian Thomas Aquinas, let\nme turn to review some of the moral\nimplications of insights into kin altruism\nand inclusive fitness emerging today\nfrom evolutionary psychology and social\nneuroscience.\nMoral Implications of Kin Altruism\nand Inclusive Fitness\nAs is well known, the idea of\ninclusive fitness was first put forth in\n1964 by William Hamilton. 12\nHamilton’s view of inclusive fitness\nholds that living beings not only struggle\nfor their individual survival but for the\nsurvival of offspring and kin who also\ncarry their genes. Their altruism is\nlikely to be proportional to the\npercentage of their genes that others\ncarry. This insight was further\ndeveloped by the concept of parental\ninvestment. Ronald Fisher and Robert\nTrivers (1972) defined it as “any\ninvestment by the parent in an individual\noffspring that increases the offspring’s\nchance of surviving…at the cost of the\nparent’s ability to invest in other\noffspring.” 13 These insights were at the\ncore of the emerging field of\nsociobiology and were first brought to\nthe wider public attention by E.O.\nWilson’s Sociobiology: The New\nSynthesis (1975). 14\nBut the moral implications of the\nconcept of inclusive fitness, parental\ninvestment, and kin altruism have\nreceived competing interpretations.\nRichard Dawkins in his The Selfish Gene\n(1976) turned these ideas into a defense\nof philosophical ethical egoism and\nargued that all altruistic acts are\ndisguised maneuvers to perpetuate our\nown genes. 15 But there are other\ninterpretations. Social neuroscientist\nJohn Cacioppo interprets our motives\ntoward inclusive fitness and kin altruism\nas the core of human intergenerational\ncare and the vital link between sociality\nand spirituality. In cooperation with his\ncolleagues, his research on loneliness\nPage | 35\nuses evolutionary theory on inclusive\nfitness to order many of his findings.\nFrom the perspective of this model of\nbasic human motivations, loneliness can\nbe seen as a condition that “promotes\ninclusive fitness by signaling ruptures in\nsocial connections and motivates the\nrepair or replacement of these\nconnections.” 16 According to his\ninterpretation of inclusive fitness, our\ngene continuity is not assured by simply\nhaving our own children. Our children\nalso must have children as well. And\nthis is a challenge entailing long-term\nexpenditures of energy. To account for\nthis, Cacioppo writes something about\nhuman infant dependency that is very\nclose to what both the Greek philosopher\nAristotle and the medieval Roman\nCatholic theologian Thomas Aquinas set\ndown many centuries earlier. Cacioppo\nsays,\nFor many species, the offspring need\nlittle or no parenting to survive and\nreproduce. Homo sapiens, however,\nare born to the longest period of\nabject dependency of any species.\nSimple reproduction, therefore, is not\nsufficient to ensure that one’s genes\nmake it into the gene pool. For an\nindividual’s genes to make it to the\ngene pool, one’s offspring must\nsurvive to reproduce. Moreover,\nsocial connections and the behaviors\nthey engender (e.g., cooperation,\naltruism, alliances) enhance the\nsurvival and reproduction of those\ninvolved, increasing inclusive\nfitness. 17\nAccording to this view, the\ntwofold interaction between inclusive\nfitness and the long period of infant\ndependency has shaped humans over the\nlong course of evolution into the social\nand caring creatures we are. Sociality is\na fundamental characteristic of humans,\nand, according to Cacioppo, spirituality,\nin its various forms, is an extension of\nsociality. Religion is generally,\nalthough not always, good for our\nmental and physical health - our heart,\nour blood pressure, our self-esteem, and\nour self-control - just like having good\nfriends and family or not being lonely\nare also good for our well-being. 18\nCacioppo and colleagues do not equate\nsociality and religion; they are fully\naware that religions are complex\nphenomena with many different\ndoctrinal, ethical, ritual, organizational,\npersonal, and social features that require\neither rigorous experimental or clinical\npopulation studies to sort out, even from\nthe perspective of how they affect\nhealth. Nonetheless, he seems to hold\nthat the sociality that most religions offer\nis a key reason for their efficacy in\nhuman well-being.\nDoes Christian Love Build on Health?\nBut my concern is the topic of\nChristian love and not simply\nChristianity’s contribution to mental and\nphysical health. Although Jesus is said\nto have performed miracles of health,\noffering health in this world has never\nbeen at the core of Christianity or, for\nthat matter, the other Abrahamic\nreligions of Judaism and Islam.\nBringing to maturity loving and selfgiving\npersons has been the primary\nconcern of Christianity, whether or not\nthis contributes to health and well-being.\nBut the question is, as I elaborated\nabove, does Christian love build on eros\n- that is, our strivings for health and\nother goods - or come exclusively from\nsome trans-natural source as Nygren\nbelieves the normative tradition taught?\nAnd did Christianity ever identify eros\nand our deepest motivations with\nPage | 36\nsomething like inclusive fitness and kin\naltruism?\nLet me start with Aquinas. In the\n“Supplement” to his Summa Theologica\nIII,\nThomas follows Aristotle and the\nRoman natural-law theorist Ulpian in\nasserting that humans share with all\nanimals an inclination to have offspring.\n19 Having said this, he then introduces a\nvery modern sounding commentary on\nthe uniqueness to humans of the long\nperiod of infant dependency. Notice the\nsimilarity of his argument to the words\nof Cacioppo above. Aquinas writes,\nYet nature does not incline thereto in\nthe same way in all animals; since\nthere are animals whose offspring\nare able to seek food immediately\nafter birth, or are sufficiently fed by\ntheir mother; and in these there is no\ntie between male and female;\nwhereas in those whose offspring\nneeding the support of both parents,\nalthough for a short time, there is a\ncertain tie, as may be seen in certain\nbirds. In man, however, since the\nchild needs the parents’ care for a\nlong time, there is a very great tie\nbetween male and female, to which\ntie even the generic nature inclines. 20\nAlthough there is in this quote a\ndescription of how family formation\nemerges at the human level, there is an\nimplicit argument for both the fact of\nhuman infant dependency and what we\ntoday call inclusive fitness as well. But\nthese ideas are even more evident in the\nnext quote, although stated very much\nfrom the male point of view, a habit\ntypical of his time. Aquinas says, “Since\nthe natural life which cannot be\npreserved in the person of an undying\nfather is preserved, by a kind of\nsuccession, in the person of the son, it is\nnaturally befitting that the son succeed in\nthe things belonging to the father.” 21\nAquinas’s main source for this insight\nwas Aristotle’s Politics. In one place\nAristotle wrote, “ In common with other\nanimals and with plants, mankind have a\nnatural desire to leave behind them an\nimage of themselves.” 22\nHowever, in both Aristotle and\nAquinas, such claims were not just about\nthe importance of kin continuity, they\nwere statements about the origin and\nneed of long-term investments by\nparents at the human level. In contrast\nto his teacher Plato who, in his Republic,\nhad advocated removing children from\ntheir biological parents in an effort to\novercome the civil frictions created by\nnepotism, 23 Aristotle counters with an\nassertion about the origins of human\ncare. Aristotle wrote, “That which is\ncommon to the greatest number has the\nleast care bestowed upon it.” He\nbelieved that in Plato’s state, “love will\nbe watery….Of the two qualities which\nchiefly inspire regard and affection –\nthat a thing is your own and that it is\nyour only one – neither can exist in such\na state as this.” 24 This is an assertion\nabout the importance of kin altruism in\nhuman care.\nAlthough Aquinas saw these\nnatural inclinations as important for the\nformation of long-term human care, he\nbelieved that they were not sufficient for\nmature parental love. Powerful social,\ncultural, and indeed religious\nreinforcements were also necessary for\nstable parental investment to be realized.\nThis, once again, is due, according to\nAquinas, because of the many long years\nof human childhood dependency; human\nchildren need their parents for a very\nlong period of time and over the course\nPage | 37\nof many contingencies and challenges.\nThis leads Aquinas to develop his\ntheology of marriage as a way of\nconsolidating and stabilizing parental\ncommitment, especially paternal\ncommitment, to their dependent\nchildren. 25\nAlthough neither Aristotle nor\nAquinas presented the full\nintergenerational scope of Cacioppo’s\ninterpretation of kin altruism and\ninclusive fitness – that it must extend to\nour children’s children and not just our\nown – both perspectives comprehended\nthe interlocking nature of kin altruism\nand the well-spring of care, long-term\nhuman commitment, and hence some of\nthe rudimentary energies of human\nmorality.\nOf course, Aquinas and those\nwho followed him supplemented these\nnaturalistic observations with additional\nepistemological presuppositions that\nmay seem strange to scientists. These\nincluded the idea that God works\nthrough nature as well as grace, hence\nGod is present in the kin altruistic\ninclinations of parents and grandparents.\nHe also assumed that in order for kin\naltruism to be stable, the additional\nsocial reinforcements of institutional\nmarriage and God’s strengthening grace\nand forgiveness were also needed. In\naddition, he held - and Christianity has\nalways taught - that Christian love\nincludes more than kin altruism and the\ncare of our familial offspring; it must\ninclude the love of neighbor, stranger,\nand enemy, even to the point of selfsacrifice.\nFor the Christian, this was\nmade possible by the idea that God was\nthe creator of all humans and hence each\nperson was a child of God and made in\nGod’s image (imago dei). For this\nreason, as Kant would say on different\ngrounds, each individual should be\ntreated “always as an end and never as a\nmeans only.” 26 In Aquinas’s view,\nacting on this belief, and with the\nempowering grace of God, made it\npossible for Christians to build on yet\nanalogically generalize their kin\naltruism to all children of God, even\nthose beyond the immediate family, their\nown children, and their own kin. These\nwider assumptions may be beyond the\ncompetence of science to assess. They\nentail a step toward metaphysical\nspeculation of the kind science would do\nbetter to avoid. Nonetheless, in the view\nof Christian love developed in Aquinas,\nthe seeds of a religious humanism – in\nthis case a Christian humanism –began\nto form.\nI have tried to illustrate how\ninsights from Aristotle and Aquinas can\njoin with insights from evolutionary\npsychology and social neuroscience to\nrefine the Christian understanding of\nlove. In pursuing this course, I join the\nwork of Stephen Pope and others in\npresenting this option. 27 The kind of\nChristian humanism found in Aquinas\nmakes it possible for Christianity to be\nenriched by the modern sciences of\nhuman nature. Aquinas’s view is\nstrikingly different from Nygren’s\nrepresentation of Paul and Luther when\nNygren contends that Christian love does\nnot build on our own natural energies,\nbut “has come to us from heaven.” 28 Or\nagain, it is very different from Nygren’s\nview when he writes that the Christian is\n“merely the tube, the channel through\nwhich God’s love flows.” 29 The\ncomplete discontinuity in this statement\nbetween the downward love of God and\nthe natural extension to nonkin of human\nkin-altruistic impulses is stunning. And\nsuch a view as Nygren’s precludes the\npossibility of a religious humanism of\nthe kind I have been describing. And it\nPage | 38\neliminates the possibility of the\nrefinements to religious views of human\nnature that the conversation between\nreligion and science can offer.\nConclusion\nMy argument has been that a\nrevived religious humanism can come\nabout through the dialogue between\nreligion and science, particularly\nbetween religion and the psychological\nsciences. I have illustrated this with the\nissue of love in Christianity. I believe\nmy argument could be illustrated with\nother religions, especially the Abrahamic\nreligions of Judaism and Islam. As\nAristotle’s influence created a kind of\nreligious humanism in these religions in\nthe past, the broader dialogue between\nscience and religion may be able to do\nthis for them in the future.\nBut the contributions will not\nsimply flow from science to religion.\nEven in this short essay, a question for\nscience to investigate has arisen. It is\nthis: how do religious and metaphysical\nbeliefs extend the impulse of natural kin\naltruism, if at all? This goes beyond the\nissue of the relation of religion to health.\nIt raises the question of the relation of\nreligion to expansive love for the distant\nother. This is a good question that\ncomes from taking the claims of religion\nseriously and an example of how\nreligion can continue to feed and\nchallenge scientific inquiry.\nReferences\n1 Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion\n(Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin Co.,\n2006); Daniel Dennett, Breaking the\nGod Spell (New York, NY.: Viking,\n2006); Sam Harris, Letter to a Christian\nNation (NY.; Alfred Knopf, 2006);\nChristopher Hitchens, God is not Great\n(NY.: Twelve, 2007).\n2 For a discussion of these distinctions\nbetween different forms of\nphenomenology, see Paul Ricoeur,\nHermeneutics and the Human Sciences\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 1981), pp. 63-100.\n3 Will Deming, Paul on Marriage and\nCelibacy (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1995).

As Don\nBrowning demonstrates through the\nexample of Thomas Aquinas, when\nreligions start with a desire to understand\nhuman behavior, such as the long-term\nhuman commitment between parent and\nchild, they recognize that science might\nilluminate and refine that understanding.\nAnd religion, in turn, might shape social\ninstitutions that not only enhance the\nhuman drive toward social connection\nbut also imaginatively extend its\ninfluence beyond direct kinship to\ninfluence ethical relations with neighbor\nand stranger. By starting with a shared\ninterest in understanding what Browning\ncalls “the rudimentary energies of\nhuman morality,” creative conversation\nbetween science and religion thus\nprompts a religious humanism, in which\nreligion partners with science to shape\nmodels of fulfillment for human\nsociality.\nLike Browning, Louise Hawkley\nstarts with the human quest for social\nconnection. As humans mature,\nHawkley observes, they proceed from\nchildhood dependence not toward\nindependence but toward\ninterdependence. But, whereas\nBrowning pursued the implications of\ninterdependence for the body politic,\nHawkley wants to know the\nconsequences of interdependence for the\nphysical body. Her research focuses on\nthe interplay between psychological and\nphysical factors in the human sense of\nsocial connectedness, and Hawkley finds\nthat “feeling wanted and accepted and\nlike one belongs are as vital to our\nexistence as the air we breathe. “ A\nrobust sense of social connection\nreverberates throughout the human body,\nand its absence—in loneliness—is likely\nto have long-term adverse effects on\npersonal health.\nPage | 41\nChapter 4 4\nHealth by Connection:\nFrom Social Brains to Resilient Bodies\nWe enter and leave the world\nalone, but at no time do we exist\ndisconnected from others. The\nconnection with the mother that begins\n4 The lead author is Louise C. Hawkley, Ph.D., a\nSenior Research Scientist (Assistant Professor),\nmember of the Center for Cognitive and Social\nNeuroscience, and Associate Director of the\nSocial Neuroscience Laboratory at the University\nof Chicago. Her research is concerned with the\ninterplay of psychological and physiological\nfactors, and includes the study of autonomic,\nneuroendocrine, immune, genetic, and behavioral\nprocesses that contribute to physical and mental\nhealth and well-being in individuals differing in\nperceived social connectedness. She has\npublished numerous articles and chapters on\nperceived social isolation (loneliness) and its\nantecedents and consequences in young and\naging adults.\nHawkley finds awe in the significance\nof what it means to be a social species. Atul\nGawande wrote, “We are social not just in the\ntrivial sense that we like company, and not just\nin the obvious sense that we each depend on\nothers. We are social in a more elemental way:\nsimply to exist as a normal human being requires\ninteraction with other people” (The New Yorker,\nMarch 2009). Hawkley believes that we are\nsocial beings to our cellular core, and even that\ndoes not capture the full extent of our sociality.\nFor these reasons, she is increasingly\nuncomfortable with the term “loneliness,” a term\nthat is laden with popular definitions and\nunderstandings that only hint at the deeper\nsignificance of our social nature. As she shows,\nwhat the study of loneliness actually reveals is\nthat feeling wanted and accepted and like one\nbelongs are as vital to our existence as the air we\nbreathe. Nothing kills like being denied a\nsocially meaningful existence.\nin utero does not end with the physical\nsevering of the umbilical cord but\ncontinues in a lengthy dependence on the\nmother or primary caregiver(s) for food\nand safety. Years are needed for the\ninfant to reach physical and reproductive\nmaturation, but as Cacioppo notes, even\nmore importantly these years are needed\nfor the infant to develop the social and\nemotional skills necessary for survival in\na complex social world. We graduate\nfrom infantile dependence not to\nindependence but to interdependence\n(cooperation, trust, reciprocity, etc.).\nThat we are born to and for connection\nexplains why feeling disconnected,\nisolated, and like we don’t belong can be\nso painful. We call these feelings\nloneliness. Feelings of loneliness\nfunction like physical pain or hunger or\nthirst; they motivate us to alleviate the\nsocial pain and to repair our sense of\nconnectedness. This is an important\nadaptive function of loneliness because\npeople who feel connected fare much\nbetter than those who feel disconnected.\nThey are not only happier but also\nhealthier than their more lonely\ncounterparts. As we will see, the power\nof felt connectedness reverberates\nthroughout the human body. As was\naptly stated by Frederick Buechner,\n“You can kiss your family and friends\ngood-bye and put miles between you,\nbut at the same time you carry them with\nyou in your heart, your mind, your\nstomach, because you do not just live in\na world but a world lives in you.” 1 We\ntend to take for granted our sense of\nsocial connectedness, but that should not\nblind us to its powerful, albeit invisible,\ninfluence on our lives. Its impact is best\nexposed when we observe the effects of\nits absence (i.e., loneliness) on physical\nand mental health and well-being.\nLoneliness is a Health Risk, but How?\nPage | 42\nFor research purposes, loneliness\nis typically measured on a continuum\nthat ranges from not at all lonely (i.e.,\nsocially connected) to very lonely. It is\ninformative, however, to get a sense of\nthe prevalence of loneliness when\nassessed as present or absent. Loneliness\nis a common experience; as many as 80\npercent of people under 18 years of age\nand 30 percent of people over 65 years\nof age report being lonely at least\nsometimes. For most people, feelings of\nloneliness are situational and transient\n(e.g., geographic relocation). For as\nmany as 15-30% of the general\npopulation, however, loneliness is a\nchronic state, and it is among these\nindividuals that loneliness wreaks its\ngreatest havoc. In a study of children\nfollowed through young adulthood,\nthose who were highly lonely at each of\nthree measurement occasions (i.e.,\nchildhood, adolescence, and at 26 years\nof age) exhibited a significantly greater\nnumber of standard health risks. The\nchronically lonely individuals were more\nlikely to have higher body mass index\n(BMI), elevated blood pressure, higher\nlevels of total cholesterol, lower levels\nof “good” HDL cholesterol, greater\nconcentrations of glycosylated\nhemoglobin (an index of impaired\nglucose metabolism), and poorer\nrespiratory fitness than those who were\nlonely at only two or one of the\nmeasurement occasions. 2 In a study of\nolder adults, loneliness predicted\nmortality over a 3-year period, and\nincreased mortality was explained by the\nfact that lonely individuals had more\nchronic diseases and functional\nlimitations. 3 Higher rates of mortality in\nlonely individuals do not appear to be\nattributable to inadequate healthcare\nutilization: even after accounting for the\npresence and severity of chronic illness,\nlonely individuals are actually more\nlikely than nonlonely individuals to\nmake use of health facilities and\nphysicians. 4\nMost chronic diseases (e.g.,\nhypertension, coronary artery disease,\ndiabetes) are the result of the interactive\ninfluences of genetic, environmental,\nand behavioral factors on physiological\nfunctioning. How do feelings of\nloneliness penetrate to a level that affects\ndisease risk? Plausible pathways include\npoor health behaviors, stress-related\nprocesses, restorative “anti-stress”\nprocesses, and even differences in\npatterns of gene activity. In general,\nphysiological systems exhibit\nredundancies and compensatory\nprocesses that minimize the immediate\nhealth effects of adverse heritable,\nenvironmental, and behavioral factors.\nHowever, subtle changes in these\npredisease pathways can be detected\nprior to the onset of manifest disease and\nmay indicate the beginnings of a steeper\ndownward trajectory in resilience. 5\nTake health behaviors, for\ninstance. Major risk factors for disease\nin Western society include high-calorie,\nhigh-fat diets, and sedentary lifestyles,\neach of which contribute to being\noverweight or obese. Feelings of\nloneliness have been associated with\ngreater incidence of these predominantly\nlifestyle risk factors. In a large crosssectional\nsurvey of adults 18 years and\nolder, the lonely group had a higher\nmean BMI and a greater proportion of\noverweight/obese individuals than did\nthe nonlonely group. Loneliness has\nbeen associated with lower levels of\nphysical activity in every age group from\ngrade school to middle-age adults. In the\nlatter study, lonely individuals were also\nmore likely to become inactive over\ntime. Changes in health status also\nPage | 43\npredicted an increased likelihood of\nbecoming inactive, but the effects of\nloneliness were independent of changes\nin health status. Similarly, individuals\nwith fewer social connections (i.e., a\nsmaller social network) were less likely\nto be physically active, but the effects of\nloneliness on physical activity did not\ndepend on the size of the social network.\nThe invisible force of loneliness seems\nto play a unique role in this particular\npredisease pathway.\nAnother commonly cited risk\nfactor for disease is stress. In reality,\n“stress” refers to a family of predisease\npathways, each of which may be\nvulnerable to the influence of lonely\nfeelings. Loneliness is itself a source of\nstress, but lonely individuals also differ\nin their exposure to stressful events and\ncircumstances. This is less evident in\nyoung adults than it is in older adults in\nwhom loneliness was associated with\nhaving experienced a greater number of\nstressful life events in the past year (e.g.,\ndeath in the family, marital crisis,\nchange in employment status) and more\nsources of chronic stress (e.g.,\nemployment stress, marital stress). 6 In\naddition, lonely individuals perceive life\nas more stressful and less gratifying than\ntheir socially connected counterparts,\neven when objective indications are that\nlonely and nonlonely individuals do not\ndiffer in the types of activities and\nbehaviors they engage in on a daily\nbasis. Good quality social interactions\ntypically ameliorate feelings of stress,\nbut because lonely people perceive their\ninteractions to be less positive than those\nof nonlonely people, they fail to derive\nthe same benefit. Good coping strategies\ncan also ameliorate feelings of stress, but\nlonely individuals are more likely to\nrespond to stress with pessimism and\navoidance than with optimism and active\nengagement. And to add insult to injury,\nloneliness increases sensitivity to and\nsurveillance for social threats. Anxiety,\nlow self-esteem, and fear of negative\nevaluation elicit self-defensive behaviors\nand effectively tax cognitive resources\nthat would normally be available to meet\nthe demands of daily life stress. Thus,\nwhat might naively be thought of as a\ncircumscribed problem—the feeling of\nloneliness and isolation—may be seen\nby the sufferer as a world of inescapable\nthreat. 7 How might these cognitions and\nperceptions influence physiology and\nhealth? As Berntson shows in his\nchapter, the brain regions involved in\nemotional and perceptual processes are\nintimately related to brain regions\ninvolved in the regulation of\nphysiological systems. This is\nparticularly evident in alterations of the\nfunctioning of the cardiovascular system\nin lonely individuals. In young adults,\nthis alteration is apparent in increased\nresistance to blood flow in small arteries\nthroughout the body. Increased vascular\nresistance is a precursor and\npredominant contributor to age-related\nincreases in systolic blood pressure\n(SBP), a major risk factor for\ncardiovascular disease. In middle-aged\nadults, SBP is significantly higher in\nlonely adults than in their nonlonely\ncounterparts. Moreover, loneliness\naccelerates the rate of increases in SBP, 8\nindicating a faster decline in\nphysiological resilience and a heightened\nrisk for chronic cardiovascular disease.\nIt’s as though loneliness accelerates the\naging process.\nBy virtue of extensive\ninterconnections among the brain,\nperipheral nervous systems, and\nendocrine glands, the feelings of\nisolation and loneliness have a broad and\nPage | 44\ndeep reach. The hypothalamus plays a\nkey role in enabling communication\nfrom brain to periphery. Located in the\nlower central region of the brain, the\nhypothalamus receives neural input on\nbrain and body states (e.g., pain,\nsadness, fear, hunger) and in response\nsignals brain regions that control the\nautonomic nervous system and the\npituitary and adrenal glands. Signals to\nthe autonomic nervous system permit\nmodulation of heart rate, blood pressure,\nand numerous other factors that serve to\nmaintain homeostasis. Signals to the\npituitary gland (located at the base of the\nbrain, just below the hypothalamus)\nprompt the release of hormones that\nultimately permit modulation of almost\nevery endocrine gland in the body,\nincluding the adrenal glands (one is\nsituated on top of each kidney). The\nadrenal glands serve many functions,\nand one is to produce and secrete\ncortisol. Cortisol is frequently referred to\nas a “stress hormone” because\ncirculating levels increase dramatically\nin response to any stimulus that requires,\nor might require, metabolic resources.\nThus, cortisol increases blood sugar\nlevels, increases blood pressure, and\nreduces immune responses and\ninflammation (hence the use of cortisone\ncream or injections to control\ninflammation of the skin after exposure\nto poison ivy). This complex web of\nphysiological links may seem far\nremoved from feelings of social\nisolation, but loneliness has repeatedly\nbeen observed to be a risk factor for\nelevated levels of cortisol, especially in\nthe morning. For instance, in middleaged\nadults, the more intense the degree\nof loneliness reported at day’s end over\nthe course of three days in everyday life,\nthe higher the spike in cortisol the\nsubsequent morning. The conundrum is\nthat loneliness is associated with\nincreased risk of chronic conditions that\nare characterized by heightened\ninflammation (e.g., atherosclerosis,\nelevated cholesterol levels, heart disease,\ndiabetes, and even cognitive\nimpairment). If cortisol dampens\ninflammation, why might elevated levels\nof cortisol in lonely individuals be\nassociated with more rather than less\ninflammation?\nIt turns out that communication\namong the hypothalamus, pituitary\ngland, and adrenal glands becomes\ndysregulated when chronically\nstimulated. Whereas cortisol effectively\ndampens immune and inflammatory\nresponses on an acute basis, when\ncirculating cortisol levels are chronically\nelevated, cells become resistant to its\nimmunosuppressant and antiinflammatory\neffects. This alteration\nhappens at the level of DNA where the\nactions of genes in each cell of our body\ncan be turned on (i.e., expressed) or off.\nRecent evidence suggests that the effects\nof loneliness reach down to this level.\nCirculating leukocytes (white blood\ncells) from a small group of chronically\nlonely adults showed decreased\nexpression of glucocorticoid response\ngenes relative to expression rates in a\nmatched group of socially connected\nadults. These genes are important\nbecause they activate the production of\nproteins that “hear” the antiinflammatory\nsignal sent by cortisol.\nThus, despite higher levels of circulating\ncortisol in the lonely group, the cortisol\nsignal may still not be heard. The lonely\ngroup also showed increased expression\nof genes carrying pro-inflammatory\nelements which, together with reduced\nexpression of glucocorticoid response\ngenes, provides a functional genomic\nexplanation for elevated risk of\nPage | 45\ninflammatory disease in individuals who\nexperience chronically high levels of\nloneliness. 9\nThe effects of loneliness are not\nlimited to an increase in healththreatening\nprocesses. Loneliness has\nalso been associated with a decrease in\nhealth-restoring processes. Sleep is the\nquintessential example. Much of what\nfeels stressful and depressing at the end\nof a long day is perceived differently\nfollowing a good night’s sleep. Good\nquality sleep is the clincher. Lonely and\nnon-lonely individuals do not differ in\nthe amount of sleep they get, but lonely\npeople have poorer sleep quality than do\nnon-lonely people. They experience\nmore micro-awakenings during the night\nand they awake feeling more tired and\nless capable of meeting the demands of\nthe day. Poor sleep has been associated\nwith elevated blood pressure and\ncardiovascular mortality, and this may\nhelp to explain the poorer health\noutcomes of chronically lonely\nindividuals. In short, lonely days extend\ninto the nights and lessen the restorative\nnature of sleep.\nLoneliness and Health: It’s Not Just\nPeripheral\nFrom this sampling of the\nwidespread effects of loneliness on\nhealth, lifestyle behaviors, physiological\nfunctioning, genetic transcription, and\nsleep quality, it should be clear that the\ninvisible power of felt isolation has long\ntentacles that have the potential to\ninfluence all of physiology. Not only\nphysical health, but also cognitive health\nis compromised. Indeed, one of the most\nsobering findings of recent years is that\nloneliness places people at risk for\nimpaired cognition and dementia. 10 In a\n4-year prospective study of initially\ndementia-free older adults, the risk of\nAlzheimer’s Disease was more than\ntwice as great in lonely than in\nnonlonely individuals. In addition,\nloneliness was associated with lower\ncognitive ability at baseline and with a\nmore rapid decline in cognition during\nthe 4-year follow-up. Similar results\nwere reported for a sample of 75-85-\nyear-old individuals over a 10-year\nfollow-up.\nThe effects of loneliness on\ncognition are evident at an even more\nfundamental level. 11 Self-regulation, or\nthe ability to regulate one’s attention,\ncognition, emotion, and/or behavior to\nbetter meet social standards or personal\ngoals, is impaired in lonely individuals.\nFor instance, among young adults,\ninstructions to shift auditory attention\nfrom the dominant right ear to the nondominant\nleft ear resulted in impaired\nperformance in lonely relative to\nnonlonely individuals. Loneliness also\nalters emotion regulation. In middleaged\nand older adults, loneliness was\nassociated with a diminished tendency to\ncapitalize on positive emotions, and this\nexplained why lonely individuals were\nless likely than nonlonely individuals to\nengage in physical activity. Impaired\ncognitive regulation is evident in\nexperimental studies that manipulate\nfeelings of isolation. Participants who\nreceive feedback that induces a sense\nthat they are doomed to a future of social\nisolation perform significantly worse on\ntests of reasoning, behave more\naggressively, and choose more tasty but\nunhealthy foods than other participants\nwho receive feedback indicating a future\nof social connection or bad feedback of a\nnon-social nature, namely that their\nfuture will consist of general\nmisfortune. 12 There seems to be\nsomething uniquely threatening about\nthe prospect, and the reality, of feeling\nPage | 46\nisolated, disconnected, and like one\ndoesn’t belong.\nIn terms of emotional health, the\nprospect for lonely people is increasing\nmisery, at least over the short term.\nLoneliness and depressed affect tend to\nbe thought of as synonymous, but the\ntwo are conceptually and empirically\ndistinct. If loneliness and depression\nwere synonymous, increases in\nloneliness would have no capacity to\npredict increases in depressive\nsymptoms because increases in one\nwould be exactly paralleled by increases\nin the other. Instead, longitudinal data\nhave shown that loneliness predicts an\nincrease in depressive symptoms but\ndepressive symptoms do not predict an\nincrease in loneliness over a one-year\ninterval. 13 Importantly, the influence of\nloneliness on depressive symptoms was\nnot attributable to fewer social\nconnections, general negativity, stress,\nor poor social support. These data\nsuggest that the relevant intervention\ntarget is loneliness, and that modifying\nthe cognitions, perceptions, and\nexpectations of the lonely individual\ncould help improve quality of life and\noverall well-being.\nSocial Connectedness: Invisible Forces\nMade Visible\nAt this juncture, having become\nacquainted with the burden of loneliness,\nit is helpful to remember that most\npeople, most of the time, feel socially\nconnected. They derive satisfaction and\nmeaning from their social relationships,\nand this makes them happier and more\nsatisfied with life. Interestingly,\nhappiness leads to higher levels of\nrelationship satisfaction, indicating that\nhappiness and relationship satisfaction\nfeed forward to foster spirals of\nincreasing happiness and relationship\nsatisfaction. The general positivity that\nensues from happiness is also apparent\nin the effects of happiness on income.\nHappiness predicted increases in\nhousehold income over a 2-year period\nin middle-aged adults. However,\nrelationship satisfaction also predicted\nincreases in household income over this\ntime period and, remarkably,\nrelationship satisfaction helped to\nexplain the effect of happiness on\nincome. It seems that happy people\nexperience increases in income in part\nbecause of the general good will that\nsurrounds the socially contented\nindividual and that elicits tangible and\nintangible positivity from others.\nIt is perhaps precisely because\nmost people feel socially connected and\nhappy that we take for granted the\ninvisible force of social connectedness\nand its stabilizing and nurturing\ninfluence in all aspects of life. Only in\nits absence do we begin to comprehend\nits power. Western notions of the\nautonomous individual notwithstanding,\nhuman beings are “wired” for social\nconnections and need social bonds to\nfeel safe, valued, motivated, and\ncompetent. 14 Among the lamentations\nexpressed by some in Western societies\nis a concern that our autonomy and\nindependence come at the expense of\nmeaningful social relationships and a\nsense of belonging to a larger social unit.\nFamily members are no longer\nobligatorily part of our social\ncommunity, while Facebook friends,\nsome of whom we know only through\nelectronic media, are deemed essential to\nfulfilling our need for a sense of\nconnectedness and belonging. 15 The\nbroadening of our social worlds has not\nbeen accompanied by maintenance,\nmuch less improvement, of the quality of\nour social relationships. One national\nstudy showed a threefold increase\nPage | 47\nbetween 1985 and 2004 in the number of\nAmericans who reported no one with\nwhom to discuss important matters. 16\nWe are a meaning-making species, and\nrelationships that offer security, comfort,\ntrust, and pleasure, even if interactions\nare relatively infrequent, are much more\neffective at fostering a sense of\nconnectedness and belonging than are\nmore friends or more frequent\ninteractions that fail to meet these\nstandards. The challenge, especially for\nthose of us who live in Western society,\nis to recognize that the invisible force of\nsocial connectedness has benefits for\nhealth and well-being that we ignore at\nour peril.\nConclusion\nThe research on loneliness\nhighlights the need for and benefits of\nhuman connections, but it speaks even\nmore directly to the role of beliefs about\nour connections. Loneliness, after all, is\nnot about how many social relationships\na person has, but is about a belief that\nthe existing social relationships fail to\nsatisfy a desired sense of social\nconnectedness. All human relationships\nhave a tangible existence in physical\ninteractions and an invisible existence in\nmental representations and beliefs. This\nhuman capacity expands the range of\npossible relationships. For instance,\nhumans form meaningful connections\nwith pets, with television characters\nwhom they have never met, and with\ndeities who lack a material existence.\nWe have seen the health impact of the\ninvisible force of loneliness; do different\nkinds of invisible forces have different\neffects?\nReferences\n1.

While\nHawkley emphasizes the relationship\nbetween the invisible forces of social\nconnection and health and the biological\nmechanisms responsible for this\nrelationship, Gary Berntson takes things\none step further by exploring a person’s\nperceived connection with God and its\neffects on our basic biological systems.\nMany of our basic biological processes,\nsuch as breathing or maintaining\nsufficient blood pressure to oxygenate\nthe brain, are reflexes that are so\nautomatic that they become invisible to\nus. Berntson shows that thoughts and\nbeliefs alter not only behaviors, but also\nthe regulation of these reflex-like\nmechanisms. And he suggests that the\nroot of these effects may lie in the way\nthat humans and other animals maintain\nbiological equilibrium with regulatory\nmechanisms that, under ordinary\ncircumstances, keep each other in check.\nThis theory describes a biological\nmechanism that could explain why\nspirituality is associated with generally\nbetter health.\nPage | 50\nChapter 5 5\nPsychosomatic Relations: From\nSuperstition to Mortality\nPeople have many sources of\ninformation, knowledge and\n5 The lead author is Gary G. Berntson, Ph.D., a\nProfessor of Psychology, Psychiatry and\nPediatrics and a member of the Neurosciences\nGraduate Faculty at the Ohio State University.\nHe is a co-founder (with John Cacioppo) of the\nfield of social neuroscience, is a co-editor of the\nHandbook of Psychophysiology and the\nHandbook of Neuroscience for the Behavioral\nSciences, and is the President of the Society for\nPsychophysiological Research. Berntson’s\nresearch focuses on the evolutionary\ndevelopment of the neuraxis, with special regard\nto levels of organization in neurobehavioral\nsystems, affective processes and autonomic\nregulation. He has published over 200 articles in\nscientific outlets and six books.\nBerntson begins with the fact that\nknowledge, thoughts and beliefs can influence\nour behaviors. Behaviors, of course, are\nphysiological processes entailing neural\noperations and muscular actions. Here we see a\nclear intersection between the psychological\ndomain on the one hand (knowledge, thoughts\nand beliefs) and the physical domain\n(neuromuscular effector systems) on the other.\nBut mind-body relations extend beyond the\nobservable actions or skeletal muscles. The mind\nand its organ, the brain, also impact powerfully\non internal bodily functions associated with the\nautonomic nervous system, the endocrine\nsystem, and the immune system, to name just a\nfew. Through these interactions, psychological\nprocesses can be translated in outcomes that have\npowerful significance for adaptation and health.\nBerntson explores the processes by which\nthoughts can manifest in fundamental changes in\ninternal physiology and health.\nunderstanding. We consider the most\ncommon of these to be empirically\nacquired, learned facts, relations,\nassociations, and perceptual and motor\nskills. Such learned associations serve as\npowerful determinants of thought and\nbehavior. But other sources of\ninformation and knowledge also affect\nour interaction with the environment,\nincluding reflex-like (constitutionally\nendowed) circuits that are independent\nof explicit learning. Examples include\ncentral networks for pain withdrawal,\nhunger circuits for the ingestion of\nessential nutrients, social affiliation\nnetworks, and neural systems that\npromote maternal bonding. Each of\nthese sources of information or\nknowledge can impact thoughts and\nbeliefs, and thoughts and beliefs can\nimpact behaviors and other bodily\nfunctions.\n“…a Maori woman who,\nhaving eaten some fruit, was told that it\nhad been taken\nfrom a tabooed place; she\nexclaimed that the sanctity of the chief\nhad been profaned\nand that his spirit would kill\nher … the next day … she was\ndead.”(1)\n“I have seen a strong young\nman die …. the same day he was tapued\n(tabooed); the victims die\nunder it as though their strength ran out\nas water. . . ”(1)\nA superstition is a belief, based\nnot on reason or knowledge, but on\nlegend, magical thinking, or other nonrational\nbasis. Beliefs color the way we\nperceive the world, they direct and shape\nour actions, and define our personalities.\nBeliefs are powerful determinants of\naction. A useful illustration of the power\nof beliefs comes from the parable of the\nPage | 51\nSultan (who had studied psychology)\nand his “lie-detecting” donkey. Lore has\nit that the Sultan was missing a valuable\nvase from his estate and suspected that\none of his servants had stolen the piece.\nTo identify the culprit, the Sultan\ngathered his servants in front of a dark\nroom in which a donkey was tied, and\nthen asked each of his servants if they\nhad stolen the item. Each said “no”. The\nSultan explained that inside the room\nwas a magical donkey, specially trained\nto detect liars, who would bray when\nslapped by someone who had lied. The\nservants were sent into the room, one by\none, and were instructed to close the\ndoor, slap the donkey and return. “When\nthe donkey brays,” the Sultan\nproclaimed, “I will have my culprit”.\nThe first servant was sent into the room\nand returned shortly thereafter--\ntremendously relieved as the donkey had\nnot brayed. One by one, the remaining\nservants entered the room and returned.\nThe donkey had not brayed and all the\nservants looked quite relaxed. The\nSultan was sanguine -- he knew this\ndonkey never brayed under any\ncircumstances. The Sultan asked the\nservants to show him their hands. He\nthen pointed to one of them and declared\n“we have our thief,” instructing the\nguards to take him away. How had he\nidentified the culprit? Rather than\nrelying on a magical donkey, the Sultan,\nwho recall was a student of psychology,\ntook a more rational approach.\nUnderstanding the impact of beliefs on\nbehavior, the Sultan had surreptitiously\ninfiltrated powdered charcoal into the\ndonkey’s hair. When the servants\nslapped the donkey, the charcoal marked\ntheir hands—with the exception of the\nguilty servant who had not slapped the\ndonkey, out of a belief and associated\nfear that the donkey could detect a liar!\nPower of Beliefs\nBeliefs may be potent\ndeterminants of behavior, but can they\nkill? And if so, how? How can these\ninvisible, intangible entities impact\nhealth? In a now classic article published\nin the American Anthropologist in 1942,\nWalter Cannon, a leading Harvard\nphysiologist and expert on the\nautonomic nervous system, proposed an\nanswer (1). Investigating phenomena\nsuch as voodoo practices of the Haitians\nand “bone-pointing” among Australian\naborigines, Cannon found a common\nfeature among the victims of such rituals\nwas a strong belief in the curse and an\nassociated morbid fear of the outcome.\nThat fear, he argued, could trigger a\n“fight-or-flight reaction” (a phrase he\nhad earlier coined), characterized by\npowerful and exaggerated activation of\nthe sympathetic nervous system. The\nresulting vascular constriction\ndiminishes blood flow to critical tissues\n(i.e., ischemia), with consequent hypoxia\n(decreased oxygen) and disturbances in\nnormal metabolism and cellular\nfunction. These reactions may be\nexacerbated by the lack of food and\nwater as the victim “pines away.”\nCannon argued that these reactions could\nbecome life-threatening—fulfilling the\ngruesome legacy of the ritual—based on\na belief in the supernatural, the veracity\nof which is largely irrelevant. More\nrelevant is the emotion triggered by the\nbelief, specious as it may be.\nBeliefs and emotions have\nconsequences, both behavioral and\nphysiological. A recent example comes\nfrom the contemporary medical\nliterature. There is now a welldocumented\ncondition, sometimes\ntriggered by something as innocuous as a\nspousal argument or a surprise birthday\nparty, which entails the hallmark clinical\nPage | 52\nand physiological features of a heart\nattack, including chest pain,\nabnormalities on the electrocardiogram,\nand elevated cardiac enzymes (reflecting\ndamaged heart muscle) (2). The\ncondition has variously been termed\ntakotsubo cardiomyopathy, leftventricular\napical ballooning,\nmyocardial stunning, stress\ncardiomyopathy, or in the more\nvernacular parlance of the New York\nTimes, broken heart syndrome\n(prompted by a medical review that was\npublished just before Valentine’s Day).\nIn general accord with the speculation of\nCannon, broken heart syndrome appears\nto be triggered by an exaggerated\nautonomic nervous system response,\ncharacterized by sympathetic activation\nand high levels of the stress hormone\nepinephrine (adrenalin) (3). It is\nimportant to note in these cases that\npsychological states, as mild as they may\nbe, are able to induce a clear and\ndemonstrable organ pathology.\nPhysiological abnormalities or\ndysfunctions underlie medical\nconditions, and indeed, constitute the\ndefining features of disease states. An\nimportant question, however, is how\nthose dysfunctions come to be. There are\nmany ways in which disease develops –\ntraumatic injuries, biotic infections,\ndegenerative conditions – and the list\ngoes on. The fields of psychophysiology,\npsychosomatic or behavioral medicine,\nand health psychology are particularly\nconcerned with how psychological and\nbehavioral factors impact physiological\nsystems and thus health. Of particular\ninterest are those psychological\ndimensions that uniquely impact\nphysiology.\nAn example comes from the\nstudy of Herpes Simplex viral infections.\nHerpes Simplex viruses are responsible\nfor cold sores (HSV type I) and genital\nherpes (HSV type II). Once contracted,\nherpes virus infections generally remain\nfor life, although they are characterized\nby periodic eruptions and remissions.\nDuring the latter, the immune system\neffectively dampens viral activity and\nthe virus retreat to a more or less\ndormant state. Although multiple factors\nlikely contribute to the reactivation of\nHSV, one trigger appears to be stress—\nthe defacing cold sore that erupts, for\nexample, just before the prom or an\nimportant date. Ohio State researchers\nsought an animal model of this\nreactivation, so the underlying links and\nmediators could be studied. Try as they\nmight, however, the research group was\nunable to reactivate HSV infections in\nmice with standard laboratory stressors,\nsuch as restraint-stress or shock. In a\ncollaborative effort, we pointed out that\nthe stressors that lead to HSV\nreactivation in humans were often of a\nsocial nature. Indeed, for both humans\nand mice, social relations are central to\nhappiness, adaptation and even survival.\nIn light of this, a social stressor was\nintroduced into the project (changing the\nhousing groupings and thus disrupting\nestablished social relations). The social\nstress, but again not physical stressors,\nresulted in significant HSV reactivation\n(4). Psychological factors, and in this\ncase a specific social psychological\nvariable, uniquely impacted an important\naspect of viral immunity. This early\nfinding led to a series of studies that\nhave elucidated physiological pathways\nthat mediate the relationship between\nsocial stress, immune function and HSV\nreactivation. But, what is it that makes\nsocial stress unique and distinct from\nphysical stressors?\nWe have identified a probable\ngeneral contributor to the differences\nPage | 53\nbetween lower-level physical or\nhomeostatic challenges and higher-level\npsychological and social stressors. Basic\nhomeostatic reflexes, reflexes that keep\nin balance various critical bodily\nprocesses such as blood pressure, body\ntemperature, and blood sugar, are largely\nhard-wired and organized at relatively\nlow levels of the nervous system, such as\nthe brainstem and spinal cord. An\nexample comes from autonomic nervous\nsystem regulation of cardiovascular\nfunction. The sympathetic division of the\nautonomic nervous system is an\nactivational, energy mobilization system\nthat comes into play in the face of\nadaptive challenges. Sympathetic\nactivation increases heart rate and results\nin peripheral vasoconstriction, both of\nwhich tend to increase blood pressure. In\ncontrast, the parasympathetic division is\nan energy-conserving, deactivational\nbrake that generally opposes the\nsympathetic system, yielding decreases\nin heart rate and blood pressure. The\nbaroreceptor heart rate reflex is a\nhomeostatic reflex that functions to\nmaintain blood pressure within\nhomeostatic limits. Unique pressure\nsensitive receptors in the heart and large\narteries detect changes in blood pressure,\nand a decrease in blood pressure triggers\nthe baroreceptor heart rate reflex,\nincreasing sympathetic activity and\nreciprocally decreasing parasympathetic\ntone. Both effects serve to increase heart\nrate (and thus cardiac output) and\nconstrict arteries throughout the body,\nthereby restoring the pressure\nperturbation. In basic reflexes, the two\nautonomic branches are generally\nregulated in this reciprocal fashion, and\nthus synergistically amplify the effects\nof the other. This is a useful mechanism\nto adjust to severe adaptive challenges\nsuch as a decrease in blood pressure and\ncompromised circulation.\nAlthough this reciprocal mode of\nregulation of the autonomic branches has\nconsiderable utility, and is characteristic\nof basic reflex organizations, it may not\nalways be optimal. The autonomic\nnervous system provides the basic\nsupport for action and adjustment, and\nalthough it figures prominently in\nsurvival related functions, it also\nprovides the basic visceral support for\nemotional and cognitive operations as\nwell. It has long been recognized that\ncognitively demanding tasks elicit\ngreater autonomic activation than is\nneeded to meet the metabolic demands\nof the tasks. Moreover, ascending neural\nsignals to the brain from visceral organs\nsuch as the heart and blood vessels serve\nto modulate and regulate cognitive\nactivities (5). The notable early\npsychologist, William James, proposed\nthat emotion is the experience of\nsomatovisceral sensory feedback. James\nsuggested that we do not run from the\nbear because we are afraid, but rather we\nare afraid because we run from the bear\n(6). Although the strong form of this\ntheory has not been supported, it remains\nthe case that ascending visceral signals\ncan modulate learning, attention, and\ncortical/cognitive processing (5). The\nautonomic nervous system is not only\nfor lower level reflexive adjustments.\nIndeed, it is increasingly recognized that\nthere is a highly complex, even intricate,\ninteraction between the autonomic\nnervous system and higher level brain\nstructures (e.g., frontal cortex) involved\nin human behavior. Importantly, these\ncircuits and their interactions with the\nautonomic nervous system are highly\nflexible and are not constrained by the\nsimple organization rules that govern\nbasal functions such as homeostasis and\nPage | 54\nreciprocal control of the autonomic\nbranches. Rather, higher level systems\nengage in highly sophisticated “banter”\nwith the autonomic nervous system.\nIn contrast to the reciprocal\ncontrol characteristic of autonomic\nreflexes, higher level brain circuits exert\nmore flexible control over the autonomic\nnervous system. This can include the\nclassic reciprocal control pattern, but can\nalso include an independent control\npattern in which only the sympathetic\nbranch or only the parasympathetic\nbranch of the autonomic nervous system\nis activated, and a coactive control\npattern in which both branches are\nactivated. This greater flexibility in\ncontrol may have behavioral and health\nsignificance.\nBeliefs about One’s Relationship with\nGod and Autonomic Functioning\nRecently, we used a populationbased\nsample of 50-68-year-old adults in\nthe Chicago Health, Aging and Social\nRelations Study to examine risk factors\nfor heart attack, a health outcome known\nto be influenced the autonomic nervous\nsystem. We were particularly interested\nin whether spirituality influenced risk for\nheart attack. With very few exceptions,\neveryone in our sample expressed a\nbelief in God. However, individuals\ndiffered in how they perceived the\nquality of their relationship with God,\nmuch as individuals differ in how they\nperceive the quality of their relationships\nwith other people. We defined\nspirituality as the degree to which a\npersonal relationship with God was\nbelieved to offer safety, security,\ncontentment, and love. One observation\nthat emerged from this study was that\nspirituality was associated with a lower\nincidence of heart attack (7). This\nremained true after ruling out the effects\nof demographics, health behaviors, body\nmass index, blood pressure, and other\npotential explanatory factors. Short of\ndivine intervention, was there a rational\nexplanation for this relationship? We\ncertainly know that psychological factors\ncan impact autonomic control, among\nother aspects of physiology.\nAs considered above, when\nextreme or prolonged, sympathetic\nactivation may have harmful\nconsequences. Heightened sympathetic\nactivation is known, for example, to\npredict a poorer outcome after heart\nattack. In contrast, parasympathetic\nactivity may have beneficial or\nprotective effects. From the perspective\nof a reciprocal model of autonomic\ncontrol, high parasympathetic/low\nsympathetic control would be optimal\nwhereas high sympathetic/low\nparasympathetic control would be\nconsidered a risk. But we also know that\nhigher level neurobehavioral systems\nmay not be constrained to reciprocal\nautonomic controls. Moreover, it has\nbeen argued that more autonomic control\nis better than little control, in that if\naffords greater capacity for adjustment\nof visceral functions. Could high levels\nof parasympathetic control, for example,\nmitigate the negative effects of\nsympathetic activation and perhaps yield\nan even more advantageous health\noutcome?\nTo examine these questions, we\ndeveloped two quantitative measures of\nautonomic control (7). The first was a\ncommon metric of autonomic balance\n(Cardiac Autonomic Balance), which\nrepresents the relative dominance of the\ntwo branches along a single autonomic\ncontinuum that ranges from purely\nparasympathetic control to purely\nsympathetic control. This metric is\nconsistent with the classical model of\nPage | 55\nreciprocal control, characteristic of\nreflex processes, where autonomic\nbalance can be biased toward one or the\nother of the autonomic branches. High\nscores indicate sympathetic dominance\nand low scores parasympathetic\ndominance. Independent estimates of\nsympathetic and parasympathetic control\nwere obtained using standard\nmeasurement procedures, and the level\nof parasympathetic control was\nsubtracted from sympathetic control to\nderive a measure of Cardiac Autonomic\nBalance. A second metric was designed\nto capture an alternative mode of\nautonomic control (Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation) that assesses the degree of\nrelative coactivation (rather than\nreciprocal activation) of both branches.\nThis is a metric that taps into the nonreciprocal\nregulatory influences of\nhigher neural structures. Cardiac\nAutonomic Regulation scores were\nderived by essentially summing\nactivities of the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic branches to afford a\nmeasure of total overall autonomic\ncardiac control. High scores indicate\nhigh activation and low scores indicate\nlow activation of both branches of the\nautonomic nervous system.\nIn the 50-68-year-old adults in\nour sample, spirituality was found to be\nassociated not only with a lower\nincidence of heart attack, but a higher\nlevel of Cardiac Autonomic Regulation.\nThat is, people who felt closer in their\nrelationship with God exhibited higher\noverall autonomic regulation—both\nsympathetic and parasympathetic. This\nwas associated, in part, with lesser\ndiminution of parasympathetic control\nand a greater degree of coactivation.\nMoreover, Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation (but not Cardiac Autonomic\nBalance) predicted better overall health\nstatus and was associated with a lower\nincidence of heart attack. Participants\nwho had low Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation were more likely to have\nsuffered from a heart attack.\nCould higher Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation scores explain why\nspirituality was associated with less risk\nfor heart attack? That is, could a pattern\nof autonomic regulation associated with\nspirituality explain the link between\nspirituality and heart attack? In order to\naddress this question, we conducted\nstatistical tests of these linkages. As we\nalready knew, both spirituality and\nCardiac Autonomic Regulation are\nassociated with a lower incidence of\nheart attack. When the predictive effects\nof spirituality were statistically\nextracted, Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation continued to be a significant\npredictor of a lower incidence of heart\nattack. However, when the linkage test\nwas reversed and the effects of Cardiac\nAutonomic Regulation were extracted,\nspirituality was no longer a significant\npredictor. This indicates that Cardiac\nAutonomic Regulation is a plausible\nmediator that may explain the\nrelationship between spirituality and\nheart attack.\nBy capturing higher levels of\nparasympathetic control and the\nassociated autonomic coactivation of the\nsympathetic and parasympathetic\nbranches, Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation provided a critical metric that\npermitted the study of a previously\n“invisible” and mysterious link between\nspirituality and health outcomes. This in\nno way diminishes the relationship\nbetween spirituality and health, but\nrather offers an important hypothesis as\nto how spirituality may impact\nphysiology and health status. Spirituality\nreflects an important aspect of the\nPage | 56\ngeneral domain of sociality and social\nrelationships, a domain heavily\ninfluenced by our genetic constitution as\na social species. Indeed, the importance\nof sociality may be more related to\nbeliefs and attitudes about the\nmeaningfulness of relationships than\ntheir existence or number. And again,\nbeliefs about social relationships also\nhave real consequences.\nConclusion\nBeliefs impact thoughts and\nactions. This may be reflected in\nphenomena as diverse as biasing a\nbehavioral disposition (such as slapping\na donkey), coloring our perception of the\nenvironment, or determining how we\nperceive the quality of our social\n(including spiritual) relations.\nPsychology can also impact physiology,\nand physiology, in turn, can influence\nour thoughts and emotions.\nPsychophysiology is the study of these\nrelationships, and promises to illuminate\nthe intricacies of psychosomatic\nrelations and the heretofore “invisible”\nmechanisms that mediate these links.\nThe relations between the mind and the\nbody, the so-called mind-body problem,\nare complex and still rather obscure.\nNevertheless, the mind-body problem is\nyielding to science, and the problem it\nposes is progressively diminishing.\nAmong the components of the mindbody\nproblem yielding to rigorous\nscientific inquiry are the effects of\nspiritual beliefs including feelings of\ncloseness to God.\nReferences\n1.

Berntson provides evidence\nthat the mind and the body, psychology\nand physiology, are not independent of\neach other but represent different levels\nof organization of human organisms.\nBeliefs influence thoughts, behaviors,\nand physiology, and peripheral\nphysiological processes signal central\nneural networks that influence\ncognitions and feelings crucial for the\ngeneration and moderation of beliefs.\nSpiritual beliefs are considered by some\nto be contentious candidates for\nscientific examination, yet Berntson\nargues that spiritual beliefs can be\nidentified, measured, and subjected to\nscientific investigation in the same\nfashion as any other belief or invisible\nforce. Accordingly, Berntson examines\nthe effects of a specific spiritual belief –\nthe belief that one has a close personal\nrelationship with God. As documented\nby Berntson, this belief is associated\nwith rather profound physiological and\nhealth effects.\nWhereas Berntson focuses on the\ninfluence of the mind on the body and\nvice versa, Gün Semin speaks of the\nmind in the body and, more specifically,\nin several bodies simultaneously. In his\nsocial cognition model, Semin\nchallenges the limits of individual social\ncognition and argues that regulation and\nco-regulation of social behavior are\ndistributed across brains. When several\nindividuals exhibit spontaneous\nsynchronized behaviors (e.g., handclapping),\nthe human tendency is to\ninvoke a “supra-individual” explanation.\nSemin describes a mechanism by which\nthe supra-individual source can be\nexplained as shared motor\nrepresentations and ongoing monitoring\nof observed actions that, under certain\nconditions, lead to dissolution of the\nboundary between self and other. The\nresulting shared experience of unity and\ncollective identity may feel\ntranscendental, but the mechanisms are\nas real and explicable as those governing\nindividual behaviors and experiences.\nPage | 58\nChapter 6 6\nThe Suspension of Individual\nConsciousness and\nThe Dissolution of Self and Other\nBoundaries\nWhen we watch a group of\nsoldiers marching in formation, we see\nthe behavior of the group synchronized.\nAlthough we can make out the\n6 The lead author is Gün R. Semin, Ph.D., an\nAcademy Professor, Royal Netherlands\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences, at Utrecht\nUniversity, The Netherlands. He is the founding\nScientific Director of the Kurt Lewin Graduate\nSchool , a past president of the European\nAssociation of Experimental Social Psychology,\nand the Chair of the International Committee of\nthe Association for Psychological Science.\nSemin’s research is primarily driven by an\ninterest in communication, social cognition as\njointly recruited process, and language and the\ndiverse uses that language can be put to in social\ninteraction (ranging from the regulation of\nprejudice to that of interpersonal relationships)\nas well as the embodied grounding of meaning\nand communication.\nA puzzle that has occupied Semin much\nof his career is how it is possible to understand\nsocial behavior by explaining individual\nprocesses. Another puzzle has been why one\nshould focus on stills when human behavior is a\nmovie: behavior is self evidently dynamic and\nhighly responsive to contextual variations.\nFinally, Semin has been puzzled by how it is\npossible to think that all there might be to\npsychological processes is some symbolic\ncomputation taking place somewhere between\nthe ears. As outlined in this essay, he has come\nto conceptualize the social in terms of jointly\nrecruited processes rather than individual ones,\nsocial behavior as situated, and psychological\nprocesses as embodied.\nindividual within the group, the group\nseems to be an entity of its own and the\nindividual soldier seems to have become\na cog in the social machine. Mob\nbehavior, crowds at sporting events, and\nsoldiers in formation all suggest that\nwhen we are organized to act together,\nthe group becomes an emergent entity\nthat can submerge the sense of the\nindividual self. This apparent social\nabsorption stands in contrast to our\ntypical experience of being autonomous,\nself-aware agents in the world. The\ndissolution of the boundary between the\nself and the group is one manifestation\nof the social brain and the mechanisms\nthat support our ability to connect with\nothers.\nAlthough not everyone has the\nexperience of marching in a band or\nrunning with a mob, most people have\nbeen part of an audience at a concert or\nplay. At the end of a particularly\nthrilling performance, an audience can\nbe moved spontaneously as a group to\nclap wildly. In these situations, we\nknow the feeling of surging to our feet as\na collective, hands clapping and faces\nbeaming with approval. As the clapping\nblooms, individual clappers merge into a\nsynchronized unit. 1, 2 Similarly,\nthousands of individual sports fans have\nbeen observed to stand and raise their\nhands in a synchronized fashion to\nproduce a collective wave that travels\naround the stadium. In both cases,\nindividual people act as a collective unit,\na superorganismal structure, with\ncapacities and behaviors beyond the\nreach of any single individual in the\ngroup.\nThese examples are instances of\nbehavioral uniformity in large groups.\nWhat is distinctive about these examples\nis that the observed behavioral\nsynchrony can be understood in terms of\nPage | 59\na shared social goal. Sometimes the goal\nis spontaneous as in clapping to\ndemonstrate appreciation and sometimes\nthe goal is imposed by the situation (e.g.,\nmusicians following a musical score and\ninstructions of a conductor, soldiers\nmarching to the call of a drill sergeant).\nHowever, when we behave in synchrony\nwith others, there is a sense of becoming\npart of something larger than ourselves.\nTo the people engaged in\nspontaneously synchronized behavior,\nthere is a clearly identifiable and\nseemingly individual ‘cause’ for their\nemergent behavior. But when a group\nshares the same goal—demonstrating\napproval—and engages in the same\naction—clapping—the stage is set for\nsuch behavior to become coordinated\nand organized even without an external\nagent (conductor or drill sergeant). How\ndo those moments of spontaneous social\naggregation occur? How does the social\nbrain work to join with others to form\nthe emergent group?\nWe have begun to understand the\nunderlying dynamics of how and when\nsuch phenomena are likely to occur and\neven how such phenomena can be\npotentially engineered. New insights\nafforded by developments in social\npsychology, developmental psychology,\nand social neuroscience have suggested\nthe way in which our brains respond to\nthe invisible force of social connection.\nThese scientific developments suggest\nneural mechanisms that may be\nimportant to the way we interact with\nothers. At the same time, the insights\nalso reveal the likely conditions under\nwhich individual self merges into the\ngroup. Such situations when the sense of\nself is suspended contrast sharply with\nthe modern Western notion of the\nindividual standing apart from others.\nIndeed, the traditional Western focus on\nindividual-centered reasons, motives,\nintentions, and causes may be at odds\nwith some forms of spontaneously\nsynchronized behaviors and group\naction.\nTowards a Biology of Social\nInteraction\nConsider the perspective of an\nengaged spectator at a singles tennis\nmatch. Although we may be sitting\ndistant from competitors, if we identify\nwith one of the players we are not\nmerely passive observers. On the\ncontrary, our observation of the events in\nthe game can serve to activate some of\nthe same neural mechanisms that would\nbe active if we were playing the game\nrather than just observing it. We can feel\nthe moves, feel the impetus to defend an\nattack, and feel the urge to slam the ball\nas if we ourselves are playing, albeit\nwithout actually flailing our arms\naround. We may even anticipate a move\nby the opponent and imagine ourselves\nmaking the potential response. Research\nover the last 10 years or so has revealed\nthat our brains can map the movements\nof other human beings onto our own\nbodies almost as if we were making\nthose movements 3 . This ability to put\nourselves in another person’s shoes\nmakes it possible to identify with either\nplayer.\nBy comparison to the audience,\nconsider how this ability can serve us as\none of the players. This capacity\nprovides an important facility for\nanticipating our opponent’s moves\nallowing us to plan a response even\nbefore the opponent has completed a\ngroundstroke. This kind of anticipation\ndoes not depend on explicit reasoning or\nconscious reflection—it seems to operate\nas an automatic mechanism 3, 4 . This\nkind of mechanism may facilitate\nPage | 60\nunderstanding the behavior of others. If\nyour brain mirrors the neural activity in\nthe brain of someone you see acting, this\ncould provide a basis for understanding\nthe motivation for the action. If your\nbrain resonates to the observed action as\nif you were acting, this could call to\nmind previous experiences acting that\nway providing a memory for why you\nacted that way. That is, our social brain\nmay directly resonate to the actions of\nothers without reasoning explicitly about\nthose actions. This kind of mechanism,\nthrough which intentions might be\ninferred, could then prepare responses\nquickly to facilitate the smooth flow of\nsocial interactions whether in a game or\na dialogue. Of course, a critical aspect\nof such a mechanism is to differentiate\nour resonance to other people’s actions\nand the control of our own. This kind\nof neural system for mapping the actions\nand intentions of others has been\nidentified with a network of regions\ncalled the mirror neuron system 5 , and\nthis system may help to induce a degree\nof reflexive similarity or identification\nbetween self and other. The mirror\nneuron system appears to be\ncontinuously engaged unless it is\nactively suppressed by inhibition, so that\nthis system may continuous monitor the\nbehavior of ‘others’ in our social\nenvironment.\nOf course, mapping the\nmovements of the opponent is useful,\nbut certainly not sufficient to defend our\nposition, score a point, or win a match.\nOne needs to execute countermoves.\nThis is the domain of the motor system\nin the brain, which includes regions\ninvolved in the preparation and\nexecution of motor action. The motor\nsystem is responsible for the\nimplementation of one’s goals and\nintentions to perform an action 6 . Thus,\nthe social brain includes monitoring and\nmotor systems that function in parallel.\nThe mirror system puts the player in the\nopponent’s shoes and monitors the\nopponent’s actions in an anticipatory\nmanner. Other parts of the social brain\nmaintain the distinction between player\nand opponent by shaping the\nimplementation of one’s actions, namely\nby engaging a counteraction.\nIn sum, a tennis game or any\nsocial interaction depends on a complex\nnetwork of brain regions that mediate\nperception and action, and the\nrelationship between observed action\nand one’s own behavior. The overlap in\nbrain regions responsible for these two\nimportant social functions suggests how\ntightly coupled and coordinated social\ninteractions can be. However, these two\nsystems cannot operate in isolation from\nour knowledge of the context in which\nbehavior occurs. We, therefore, turn to\nthis topic next.\nThe Social Context\nIn a tennis game or any social\ninteraction (e.g., dancing, conversation),\nthe behavior of one individual\nconstitutes a stimulus for others. If a\nbehavior is meaningful, then neural\nmechanisms responsible for social\nperception and social interaction are\nlikely to be activated to engage in\ncomplementary action. In a competitive\ncontext, such as the tennis game, the\nmotor system is engaged in the\npreparation and execution of\ncomplementary actions to those\nobserved and anticipated based on the\ninferred goals and intentions of the\ncompetitor. However, if everyone shares\nthe same goal, for example, as in an\naudience clapping, the neural systems\nfor monitoring the actions of others and\nexecuting one’s own actions can be\nPage | 61\nmutually reinforcing leading to\nsynchrony.\nIn any dynamic social situation\nobserving one person’s action can\ninitiate neural activity in another. Parts\nof the observer’s motor system become\nactivated, making it possible to respond\nin synchrony. In fact, the specific actions\nthat are observed are not as important as\nthe perceived goals or intentions of the\nobserved person. One consequence of\nthis is that a person is sensitive to new\nactions in the social environment. A\nsecond is that significant actions by\nanother person can quickly produce\ncomplementary motor responses. Thus,\nadaptive social behavior is a product of\nperceptual monitoring and motor\nprocesses. The complexity of the social\nenvironment necessitates selective\nresponding to socially significant\nfeatures of any social interaction. Such\nselective responding depends on the\nobserver having particular goals for\naction. The identification of significant\nstimuli (e.g., a threatening backhand\nsmash) activates in the competitor’s\nbrain goal-driven decision processes that\noperate in parallel with continuous social\nmonitoring and lead to a counteraction\n(e.g., a defensive lob) produced by the\nmotor system. However, a linesman\ncollecting a ball during a tennis match\ndoes not constitute a significant action\nfor the competition and, even if\nobserved, does not initiate any\ncounteraction.\nLet us now return to the\nperspective of a spectator at the tennis\nmatch. While the specific movements\ndriving the tennis match have significant\nimplications for the players’ actions,\nthese movements have a different\nimplication for the spectator from whom\nno overt responses are warranted. If an\nobserved action produced by someone\nelse does not have personal significance\nfor an observer, the motor system does\nnot respond in the same way at all 7 . The\ngoal-dependent aspect of observing the\nactions of others allows us to understand\nand respond quickly and effectively\nwithout confusing what we do with what\nwe see. However, in some special cases,\nwhen a group of individuals all respond\ntogether, the same motor system may\noperate differently. It is in these\nsituations when we are neither observer\nnor respondent but part of a flock or\nchorus that our sense of individuated self\nmay begin to dissolve into the larger\nsocial group.\nThe Social Parameters for Suspended\nSelf-Consciousness\nThe dissolution of self-other\nboundaries is likely to be manifest under\na specific set of conditions, which\nincludes a strong feeling of identification\nwith (i.e., connection between) oneself\nand a group of others, the absence of\nconstraints to action by oneself or the\nobserved others, a common goal shared\nby the group, and the absence of a\nrecognized external synchronizing signal\nto which one can attribute any\nsynchronized behavior. Clapping in\nunison following a rousing performance\nis a more common example. This\nremarkable phenomenon is evidenced\ndespite considerable individual\ndifferences in clapping tempos. The\ntransition to entrained clapping, whereby\neach clapper affects the surrounding\nother clappers both locally and globally,\nenhances the noise intensity at the\nmoment of the clapping even though it\nleads to a decrease in the overall average\nnoise intensity in the room.\nSynchronized behavior occurs\nrhythmically and one way of capturing\nits regularities is to model its cycles,\nperiods, frequencies, and amplitudes 1,2 .\nPage | 62\nDepending on the particular behavior\nand interaction in question, behavioral\ncycles of interpersonal entrainment can\nrange from milliseconds to hours.\nIndeed, this kind of interpersonal\nentrainment is a pervasive phenomenon\nnot specific to human social behavior\nalone 8 .\nWhen does synchronized\nclapping occur? The distinctive feature\nof such an event is a convergence\nbetween the neural mechanisms\nunderlying the monitoring of the\nmovement of others and the execution of\none’s own movements. The specific\nfactors responsible for the tipping point\nfrom asynchronous to synchronous\nclapping are not yet known, but\ndescriptively each individual shifts the\ntiming of his or her subsequent clap to\nthe perceived timing of claps by the\nwhole collective. Thus, a continuous\nadjustment process emerges in the form\nof a collective behavior (synchronized\nclapping) to which each individual\ncontributes and no single individual\ncontrols. Such continuous monitoring of\nthe collective rather than individuals\nwithin the collective and the adjustment\nof one’s own movements to synchronize\none’s behavior with that of the collective\nresult in a continuous loop of performing\nthe very same action leading to\ndissolution between self and other and\nthe emergence of an entrained unit. The\nresulting effect is the materialization of a\nsupra-individual behavioral\nphenomenon, namely extended\nbehavioral cycles that are locked\ntogether in time. Although the\nemergence of clapping in unison can be\nregarded as a phenomenon worthy of\nmore detailed understanding, it does not\ninduce in its performers the necessity of\nsearching for an explanation since the\nreadily available account is that the\nperformance somehow produces\nsynchronous clapping.\nThere is preliminary evidence\nthat even with no externally imposed\ndemands prolonged synchronization\nemerges within pairs of people\ninteracting or dyads 9 . What one finds is\nthat despite individual differences in\nmovements, participants entrain (tap\ntogether in time) rapidly when\nparticipants can perceive the behavior of\nothers 9 . Extensive research in\ncoordination dynamics has demonstrated\nthat such entrainment does not depend\non the intention to coordinate behavior\n10, 11 . Studies have repeatedly shown that\nthere is a spontaneous propensity to\nmimic other people (generally observed\nin dyads). One implication this kind of\nbehavioral synchrony is the emergence\nof affective bonding – such as a feeling\nof rapport – both in the case of mimicry 12\nand between the synchronized partners 13 .\nOne might conjecture that positive\nfeelings are even stronger when more\npeople are synchronized.\nThe conditions that lead to\nbehavioral synchrony can vary. It is\ninteresting that people may be more\nlikely to experience the dissolution of\nself-other boundaries when\nsynchronization is produced without any\nobvious external director and is\ncontinuous. Prolonged spontaneous and\nunintended entrainment among three or\nmore people may introduce this feeling,\nbecause the emergence of synchrony\ncannot be attributed to a single external\ncause.\nConclusions\nSocial interaction involving\nextended periods of synchronized\nbehavior are not part of our daily\nexperience, particularly when they\ninvolve more than two people. How do\nPage | 63\nwe understand this kind of synchrony\nwhen it occurs? In the Western\nintellectual tradition, we have a strong\ntendency to search and explain events in\nterms of individual agency and\ncausation.\nSocial events are generally\nunderstood in terms of contributions of\nthe individual and the situation itself.\nThe degree to which the person or the\nsituational constraints shape the nature\nof the event will vary greatly. However,\nspontaneous and prolonged entrainment\namong three or more people introduces\nan experience that is difficult to explain\nby these more traditional accounts.\nThese experiences cannot be easily\nreduced the actions of a single person, so\nan account has to be found in some\nsource that goes beyond the individual.\nThe powerful sense of unity and\nbelonging that emerges from this kind of\nexperience almost demands a different\nkind of explanation than we generally\nconsider. Indeed, such feelings\nemerging from the synchrony of\nbehavior may provide some of the\nfoundation for the cultural interpretation\nof a transcendental experience.\nReferences\n1 Ne´da, Z., Ravasz, E., Brechet, Y.,\nVicsek, T., & Barabasi, A.

When a mob\nforms to surge together down a street\none way and then another; when a flock\nof birds wheels about together, closely\nclustered as they fly without colliding;\nand when an orchestra performs with\nhighly coordinated timing, we\nmomentarily forget about the individuals\nand see the collective behavior as a new,\nsingle social entity. Indeed, as Cacioppo\ndiscusses, many species seem to gather,\nflock, and coordinate to form such\ncollectives. For humans there are many\nsituations from flash mobs and sports\nteams to choirs and audiences, when\npeople congregate in this way.\nThe drive for people to affiliate\nand group is not sufficient on its own to\nproduce the coordinated behavior that\nemerges from such a collective.\nSometimes an organizing signal, like the\nconductor of an orchestra, can\nsynchronize the behavior. Other times\ncommon goals and behavioral\nconstraints can synchronize a group, as\nin a flock of birds. In his chapter, Gün\nSemin discusses how such synchrony\nmay be self-organizing – that is, it is\nachieved without intention, effort, or\nawareness by our social brains, even\nwhen there is no clear signal or\nconstraint. In cases of such human\nsociality, the group may act as though it\nhas a single mind. Indeed, Semin\napproaches this issue to relate the\ncollective behavior as an embodied\nconsequence of individual social forces\nthat jointly operate to satisfy our need to\naffiliate, and to consider how connecting\nbehavior through synchrony may create\na collective mind.\nHoward Nusbaum specifically\ndiscusses a different invisible social\nforce that has evolved with the power to\nbind people into a collective—language.\nLanguage is the richest social signal that\nhas the power to move people to act and\nto move groups to act together. In order\nfor language to act as a force, it must\nsomehow affect people with sufficient\nsocial and emotional impact. As\nNusbaum discusses the impact of\nlanguage, it operates at a social and\nemotional level similar to that discussed\nby Semin rather than exclusively\nthrough the inferences drawn from\nmeaning.\nPage | 66\nChapter 7 7\nAction at a Distance: The Invisible\nForce of Language\n7 The lead author is Howard Nusbaum, Ph.D.,\nProfessor of Psychology and Computational\nNeuroscience, and co-director of the Center for\nCognitive and Social Neuroscience at the\nUniversity of Chicago. He has served as the\nChair of the Psychology Department since 1997.\nHe has served as the editor for the International\nJournal of Speech Technology and is on the\neditorial board of Brain & Language, and has\nedited several books on spoken language\nprocessing. His research interests include\nspoken language use, mechanisms of learning\nand attention, and the role of sleep in learning.\nHis recent research has investigated the social\nuse of language and the evolution of language.\nIn addition, he has been working on neural\nmechanisms of reward and economic decisions.\nWe often think about language in terms\nof the information in newspapers or speeches or\nreports. However, language is basis of all our\nsocial relationships and institutions. We reward\nand praise with language and we shun and\npunish with language, perhaps more often than\nwith any other medium. In the recent election,\nDemocratic candidates actually gave speeches\noutlining different views of the importance of\nlanguage in our society. One candidate held that\nwords are simply words and only have the force\nthat we give to them by reasoning about them.\nThe other candidate argued that speech has the\npower to move people to connect and act.\nNusbaum was struck by this debate because it\nseems to him that the power of language goes\nwell beyond what linguists and psychologists\ntalk about as “meaning” and that understanding\nthe meaning of language may depend on\nunderstanding the social and emotional impact of\nlanguage. In this chapter, the idea of the impact\nof language at a distance is explored.\nLanguage is one of the most\nimportant ways in which the social brain\nmakes connections, enhances\nconnections, and severs connections\namong people. Language is our primary\nmedium of social exchange, grounding\nand elaborating our selves and our\nrelationships in every conversation.\nHowever, language goes well beyond\npersonal connections to connect us\nculturally through stories, songs, and\nshared manners of speech. Language\nalso provides the formal framework that\ndefines many of our social institutions.\nLanguage gives form and substance to\nthe governance and behavior of every\nsocial institution from education to law\nto religion. Clearly there are many ways\nin which language serves to knit us\ntogether both formally and informally.\nFor a linguist, all of these uses can be\nanalyzed in terms of the structure of\nsentences and their content. However,\nstructure and content do not, on their\nown merits, provide a complete picture\nof how language can have the impact it\ndoes on our sense of social connection.\nHow does language move us to act,\nchange our feelings, and connect us to\nothers? It seems unlikely that the impact\nof language is simply the result of\ndispassionate rational inferences and\nconclusions drawn from a logical\nanalysis of sentences.\nIn 1976, Barbara Jordan, a\nCongresswoman from Texas, gave the\ncommencement address at Brandeis\nUniversity. Listening to her speak about\nthe importance of public service and the\nimportance of using talent and ability in\nservice of one’s country was an\nimpressive experience. Her delivery was\nclear and not particularly dramatic and\nyet the force of her speech was riveting.\nIt was sufficient to turn a graduating\nsenior’s mind from graduate school in\nPage | 67\npsychology to (at least momentary)\nconsideration of a career in government\nservice. A student with the long-held\nintent of becoming a researcher and with\nno interest in politics, government, or\npublic service might seem to be an\nimmovable object. And yet, in that\nmoment, Jordan’s speech had sufficient\nimpact to make government service\nseem like the only path one would want\nto take or should ever consider.\nAlthough her points were argued\nwell, the impact of Jordan’s speech was\nnot simply rhetorical. John F.\nKennedy’s “Ask not what your country\ncan do for you….” and Martin Luther\nKing, Jr.’s “I have a dream….” affected\nlisteners deeply well beyond the\ncognitive strengths of a good argument.\nMoreover, while all these speeches were\ndelivered beautifully and from the heart,\nit is not the performance of these\nspeeches alone that can move listeners to\nact on behalf of others. The\nperformance alone cannot give substance\nto an empty message. While there are\ncases in which a great performance may\nsuggest briefly that there was content of\nimport even in the absence of a real\nmessage, it is more likely the\nconjunction of message and delivery that\nmoves people. In these speeches is a\nclear demonstration of the power of\nlanguage. Language is more than words\nand more than delivery. Indeed, Cicero,\nin De Oratore, said that rhetoric conveys\ninformation, persuades listeners, and\nevokes emotion.\n“In the beginning was the word….”\nIf “the word made flesh” is taken\nmetaphorically, the power of language\ncan be made visceral in sermons.\nConsider the power of Jonathan\nEdwards’ sermon, which Clark Gilpin’s\nchapter discusses, to terrify a\ncongregation, to wrench them from\ncomplacency with images of torment. A\nsermon delivers a message, but it can do\nso in calm tones of instruction or with\nfire and brimstone. The choice and\npoetry of words and the cadence and\nintonation of speaking can draw the\nlistener in slowly or seize the listener\nsuddenly, the very sounds of speech\npainting images in the mind while\nigniting new inferences with literal and\nmetaphoric descriptions.\nIn the realm of the spiritual, there\nare few corporeal manifestations that can\nbe perceived directly. Neither heaven\nnor hell, neither God nor the Devil can\nbe seen or heard or touched. Preaching\nis needed to spell out the work of unseen\nhands and will and illuminate the power\nof the unseen. The force of that which is\nnot seen can only be felt when\ntransmitted directly through speech.\nIn Phaedrus, Plato described\nrhetoric as the art of leading the soul.\nThus it is not surprising that, while at the\ncore of religion is a collection of beliefs\nand concepts and canons, the fabric and\nform of religion is language. Symbols\nand icons are certainly important, but\nlanguage is the medium through which\nthe force of theology is actualized in\nprayers, benedictions, sermons, and\nteaching. Language can reach across\ntime and space to change minds,\nfeelings, and behavior, encoding laws\nand beliefs and presenting them with a\nconcrete reality in the here and now.\nThis is one kind of impact from author to\naudience in which a kind of connection\nis constructed bridging minds.\nAt the same time, in religious\npractices, another kind of connection is\nformed within a congregation. Joint\nrecitation, responsive reading, collective\nlistening, and understanding may serve\nPage | 68\nto connect people in a religious service.\nAlthough joint participation in any event\n(such as sports or theatre) may have\nsome of the same effect as discussed by\nGün Semin, the content of language and\nthe intent of the messages in religious\npractice is often focused on developing\nand strengthening social and spiritual\nconnections.\nEveryone knows someone who\nmoved to another country, or to another\npart of their own country where speech\npatterns differ. After a period of time, in\nthe context of novel speech patterns,\nsome people adopt the speech patterns\naround them. This kind of linguistic\nconvergence is well documented and is\nmoderated by social factors such as the\ndesire to be accepted or the attempt to be\npersuasive. 1 When people talk together,\none person’s speech can impact the way\nanother person talks in order to promote\nsocial connection. Indeed, the same kind\nof behavioral convergence is found over\nthe course of conversations for other\nkinds of non-linguistic actions as well. 2\nInformation, impact, and\nunderstanding\nHow does language bind us\ntogether and compel us to action,\nthought, and feeling? When we talk,\nsound vibration is transmitted from\nmouth to ears. Facial expressions and\nmanual gestures punctuate, illustrate,\nand illuminate our speech. These\nacoustic and visual signals travel over\nspace and time to the eyes and ears of\nthe audience. The impact of such\ncommunication is true action at a\ndistance.\nThis notion of language as action\nat a distance is relatively well accepted\nin the scientific study of language. But\nin research on language and\ncommunication by psycholinguists and\nlinguists, the emphasis is on the\ninformation contained within an\nutterance and the structure and form by\nwhich this information is presented.\nResearch questions often focus on the\nvariety of ways the same message can be\nframed and how listeners interpret such\nmessages. But little of this work\naddresses the impact of the message\nitself.\nThe standard view of language\nprocessing is that we hear the sounds of\nspeech (acoustic patterns) that we\ntranslate mentally into words. The\nmeanings of these words are determined\nand then the meanings combined\n(through our knowledge of sentence\nstructure) to result in sentence meaning.\nGiven that a sentence typically occurs in\na context of other sentences (e.g., a\nsermon) or in response to other speech\n(e.g., a conversation), this context is then\nused to frame and reinterpret the\nsentence meaning.\nMetaphor, irony, sarcasm, and\nother figures are generally thought of as\nbeing understood later in this process\nalthough in Gilpin’s chapter the\nimmediate power of these to affect us is\nquite clear. Emotion and attitudes are\nthought of as not understood until after\nthe linguistic message has been\ndetermined. The impact of language on\nattitudes through persuasion is viewed\nby cognitive psychology and linguistics\nas occurring after the message has been\nunderstood. However, this does raise the\nquestion about whether a “message” (to\nbe understood) is simply the linguistic\nproperties of a sentence or the impact of\nthe linguistic form on an audience.\nA very different view of\nlanguage might come from considering\nvocal communications that often have a\ndirect impact on an audience.\nPage | 69\nSometimes just listening to laughter\ncompels listeners to laugh. Sometimes\nhearing a cry of terror directly imputes\nan instantaneous feeling of fear.\nHearing someone weep can produce a\nfeeling of sorrow and perhaps even\ncause one to cry. This suggests that\nsome forms of vocal communication can\nelicit direct empathic sharing as Decety\ndiscusses in his chapter.\nThese forms of vocal\ncommunication can produce direct\nresults in listeners without following a\nroute of symbolic reference and\ninterpretation. 3 Language has typically\nbeen viewed as operating by the more\nsymbolic route because of the linguistic\nclaim that symbols are not the things\nthey stand for and thus must be\nunderstood—words and sentences are\nnot felt. However, the right insult or\nangry words delivered in the right way\nor the right praise seems to be felt\ndirectly, perhaps through the same kind\nof mechanisms by which empathic\nsharing occurs.\nBut how is this achieved? This\nkind of impact of language is not a result\nof understanding the content of speech.\nIt reflects social goals and motives. To\nthe extent that this kind of social impact\nmay parallel empathic processes, we\nmight find that similar mechanisms are\ninvolved. Some kind of resonance must\nbe established between a speaker and\nhearer, and language can serve to\nestablish this resonance and lead to\nsubsequent action by the hearer. This\nidea of a resonance in an audience does\nseem more compatible with the effects\nof vocal behavior such as laughter or\ncrying on a listener than the symbolic\ninterpretative view. This notion of\nresonance may also be useful in\nunderstanding other kinds of language\nimpact from the fiery sermon of\nEdwards to the passionate speeches of\nObama and Kennedy and King.\nIn listening to speech that has\nimpact, language has created a state in\nthe listener that reflects the intention of\nthe speaker. Whether it is fear or\nconnection, somehow language can\noperate as the medium by which social\nand emotional psychological states get\ntransmitted to an audience. But how\ndoes this impact get created in the social\nbrain?\nLanguage impact in the social brain\nUnderstanding spoken language\nhas typically been viewed as an analytic\nprocess in which sound patterns are\ntranslated into linguistic symbols by the\nbrain. However, an alternative theory is\nthat we understand spoken language by\nusing our motor system to simulate what\nmight have been said. The idea is that\ntrying to mentally produce the speech\ninternally (without talking) might help\nus understand what is said, when speech\nis not clear. However, this theory did\nnot have much neural plausibility.\nPeople do not generally move their\nmouths overtly or even covertly while\nlistening.\nThe discovery of mirror neurons,\nexamined at greater length by Steve\nSmall in the next chapter, suggested one\nkind of mechanism that might instantiate\nthis kind of process. In certain parts of\nthe brain, involved in the control of\naction, some neurons that respond when\nmaking certain actions also respond\nwhen observing the same actions. This\nled to the inference that these neurons\nare involved in understanding the\nbehavior of other people. The reasoning\nis simply that neural activity in the\nobserver’s motor system that results\nwhen seeing a behavior essentially\nestablishes the brain state that would\nPage | 70\ncorrespond if the observer were doing\nthe same thing. Another way to say this\nis that there is a resonant response in an\nobserver’s motor system to observing a\nbehavior and this may potentiate a\ndegree of social coordination and\nconnection, as discussed in Semin’s\nchapter. This kind of neural resonance\nhas been shown to play a role in\nunderstanding speech when seeing a\ntalker’s mouth move, even if the listener\ndoes not actually make any mouth\nmovements.\nMirror neurons demonstrate that\nobserved action can produce a resonant\nresponse in an observer’s brain. Seeing\na talker’s mouth move creates a motorresonant\nresponse that aids in\nunderstanding speech sounds. However,\nthese two observations are very different\nfrom the idea that the meaning of\nsentences can create a resonant response\nin the listener’s brain. In the case of\nspeech, mouth movements are the\nactions that create speech. This might\nseem like a very special case. The\ntraditional linguistic view of language is\nthat words and sentences are symbolic:\nLanguage describing action is not action\nitself. Language describing emotion is\nnot the emotion itself. The entire\nconcept of a symbol is that a symbol\ndenotes something, stands for\nsomething, but the symbol is not the\nthing itself. But it now appears that this\nlong-held notion may be wrong.\nThe idea that seeing an object or\nevent gives rise to brain states that\nresonate with previous experiences of\nthat thing suggests a mechanism for\nlanguage understanding to go beyond\nsymbolic interpretation. Given that there\nis a brain mechanism for re-experiencing\nactions or sensations, this same\nmechanism may operate even when\nthere is just a symbolic linguistic\ndescription. Understanding language\nmay take place by invoking such\nresonant past experiences in the brain.\nFor example, when listening to\nsentences about hockey action, hockey\nplayers show neural activity in their\nmotor system which is not seen for\npeople who are naïve to hockey. 4\nExperience playing hockey recruits the\nmotor system in service of\nunderstanding hockey sentences as if\none were watching or playing hockey\nwhen only listening to speech. This\nsuggests one way in which language can\nhave a direct impact on a listener.\nRather than making inferences about\nactions based on the meanings of\nsentences, understanding a sentence may\nbe a resonant motor system response in\nthe listener to a description of an action.\nIf this idea is extended more broadly,\nlanguage impact may come from such\nresonant responses. Language\nunderstanding and the impact of\nlanguage may result from processes\nmore similar to the effects of hearing\nlaughter. Hearing a sentence may create\nin a listener a set of resonant responses\nvery similar to the patterns that\ncorrespond to the actual situations being\ndescribed.\nSuch resonant responses need not\nbe confined to the motor system and\nactions. Emotions such as fear or joy\nmay be empathically evoked in listeners\nby speech just as a scream or laughter\nmight. Verbal expression of attitudes\nmay produce similar attitudinal\nresponses in listeners. Moreover, if a\nlistener’s resonant response is strong,\nthere may be increased empathic overlap\nwith the speaker, which may serve to\nincrease social connection. To the\nextent that people speak together and\nshare feelings, social connection may\nincrease as well.\nPage | 71\nEvolution of social connection by\ncommunication\nThe human social brain\nconstructs connection and understanding\nby anthropomorphic projection as\ndiscussed by Nick Epley in his chapter.\nWhen we observe the behavior of\nnonhuman entities, anthropomorphic\nprojection may form a feeling of social\nconnection. Social connection depends\nin part on empathic responses to\nobserved action. It has been argued that\nthis same foundation is the basis for the\nevolution of language as well--observed\naction may be the foundation for\nlanguage. 5\nA mirror neuron theory of the\nevolution of language starts with the\nassumption that we understand others by\nobserving their actions. Communication\ndepends on the regularization of typical\nactions that can be pantomimed. In\nprinciple this could lead to a kind of\nmanual gestural system of\ncommunication akin to sign language.\nHand and arm movements can depict a\nwide range of actions both by firstperson\ndepiction of an action such as\nscrewing the top onto a jar and by thirdperson\ndepictions such as using the\nfingers to portray a person walking.\nHand and arm postures can depict\nobjects such as a cupped hand\nrepresenting a bowl. Combining\nsequences of such object and action\ndepictions can communicate relatively\ncomplex messages even without a\nformal language. This is a far cry from\nsign languages in which the mapping\nbetween hand shapes and movements is\nnot visually transparent in this way. But\nas the pressure to communicate a\nbroader range of messages increases, a\nmanual gestural language would have to\nbe modified to reflect more abstract\nsymbols ultimately leading in the\ndirection of a sign language.\nHowever, this kind of manual\nlanguage has one major drawback.\nCommunication depends on visual\ncontact. In order to understand a\ngestural message it is necessary to see\nthe hand movements. This limits the\ndistances over which communication can\ntake place. Moreover, a communication\nsystem that is effective for a group\nshould not depend on face-to-face\ndyadic interaction, but allow for more\nbroadcast communications. There is a\ngreat survival advantage in being able to\nmaintain social connection and convey\ninformation over distances that go well\nbeyond face-to-face communication.\nMany species of fish,\namphibians, reptiles, birds, and\nmammals commonly exchange\ninformation at a distance through\nvocalizations. The learned songs (and\nsome calls) of songbirds are particularly\nrich sources of information conveying,\nto the receiver, individual identity and a\nhost of other characteristics of the\nsender. Some mammals exchange\ninformation at great distances through\ncalling behavior. Humpback whale\nvocalizations are perceived over\nextremely long distances and may be\nused to maintain social groups at\ndistances as great as 5 km. African\nelephants can recognize friends and\nrelatives from their calls at a distance of\n2.5 km. Human sheepherders keep each\nother company from the top of one\nmountain to another in the Canary\nIslands using a whistled language called\nSilbo Gomero. Whether for purposes of\nmating, threat, warning, or social\norganization, conveying information\nregarding location, identity and\nmotivation, and directed at one\nindividual or towards far-flung groups,\nPage | 72\nvocal communication plays an important\nrole in the social connection and\nbehavior of a great number of vertebrate\nspecies. Thus while human vocal\ncommunication is enhanced substantially\nin face-to-face interaction, the evolution\nof speech has resulted in a system that\ncan function even in the absence of\ndirect visual observation. The sound of\na threat or warning or distress can have\nsubstantial impact even at a distance\nfrom the speaker.\nSocial impact and embodied language\nMany animals use vocalizations\nto maintain social group structure and to\nprovide information relevant to a group.\nEven very young children use the way\npeople speak as a marker of their social\naffiliation. 6 Such vocalizations are\ntypically not viewed as symbolic forms\nthat must be decoded and interpreted.\nInstead these vocalizations are mapped\nonto internal states more directly, much\nas human laughter may be. Although\nlinguists and psychologists have often\ntried to differentiate human language\nfrom these kinds of vocalizations,\nlanguage can impact us in much the\nsame way. Perhaps language is less\nsymbolic and more direct than scientists\nhave thought.\nWhat does it mean for language\nto have impact? If we take laughter as\nour model, perhaps it means that\nlanguage gives rise to responses that\nhave a direct effect on our perceptual\nand motor systems. Sermons may terrify\nbecause they create worlds inside of the\nlistener that seem real. We can see and\nhear torment and imagine the feelings of\npain and suffering. This is not a\nsymbolic interpretation but a real\nexperience created from language.\nHowever, just as we can distinguish the\npain we feel from the pain of others,\neven when we have strong empathic\nresponses, we can distinguish such\ncreated experiences from those that\noccur in the real world. The stronger the\nlanguage, the richer the imagery, the\nmore intense the delivery, the more\nsalient the mentally created experience.\nOne impact of language may be to create\nreal feelings and sensations, imagined\nmovement and behavior. 7 When\nlanguage hurts us through criticism,\nrejection or insult, it may do so by\nactivating our experiences of real pain.\nWhen we are soothed by language, it\nmay produce the same kind of endorphin\neffect that placebo treatments can\ninvoke. When language binds us\ntogether, it may do so by creating the\nkind of shared emotional states that\ncharacterize empathy.\nIn many respects, the linguistic\nview of language use does not engage\nthese ways in which language functions.\nLinguistics treats language as consisting\nof patterns of symbols divorced from\ntheir origins in a human mouth, almost\nlike print on a page rather than speech.\nBut it is spoken language that the social\nbrain evolved to use—print is a very\nmodern invention which did not play any\nrole in our evolution. In contrast, speech\nis produced from a coordinate action of\nmuscles compressing lungs and moving\ntongue and jaw under the control of\nneurophysiology and hormones. Unlike\nthe shape of printed letters, the sound of\nspeech is shaped by attitude and emotion\nand intent, and its impact may be to\ntransfer specific embodied states from\nthe speaker to the listener.\nConclusion\nAlthough physicists have debated\nthe possibility of action at a distance for\nquite some time, the biological form of\naction at a distance is well established,\nPage | 73\nachieved through vocal communication\nin an extremely broad range of behaviors\nand settings. The force of language is\ncarried by the form, content, and\ndelivery of a message. And the impact\nof this force may be created in the minds\nof an audience by the resonant\ninvocation of past real experiences. Real\npain and sorrow, real comfort and joy,\nreal love and caring, are all part of our\nshared human experience. The impact\nof language may come by invoking\nresonant past experiences that can create\na platonic mental moment that flickers\nwith the shadows of those experiences.\nIn order to understand how this process\nworks, we need to study how brain\nmechanisms operate to translate the\nsounds of speech into the impact of\nlanguage.\nReferences\n1.

Do we take people at their\nword, or do actions speak even louder?\nWhen moved to affiliate and to act in\nconcert with other people as a group, we\nneed to understand the communications\nand actions of others. Language can\nmove us to action even across great\ndistances but how does it do so? While\nwe can observe the behavior of groups\nof people as coordinated, the mechanism\nof achieving this coordination is unseen.\nWe may be driven socially to form\ngroups but how does that drive function\nin the individual to cause us to cohere.\nIn order to go beyond the observation\nand experiences we have with groups\nand group behavior, we need to\nunderstand what makes the engine of\nsocial connection run. At one level, we\ncan talk about language as a force itself,\nas Howard Nusbaum does. We can talk\nabout the synchronization of individual\nbehavior as Gün Semin does. However,\nboth of these are observations about the\nway individuals may become part of a\ngroup. To go beyond this we must look\nto our biology to understand how the\nmachinery underneath our sociality leads\nto connected minds.\nSemin suggested one way our\nbrains may seek to connect. Some\nneurons in an area of the brain that is\ninvolved in the control and planning of\nour actions also respond when we\nobserve actions we have performed.\nSuch neurons might be thought to\n“resonate” when seeing someone act or\nspeak with our own experiences.\nNeurons that mirror actions and behavior\nhave been thought to play a role in the\nprocess of understanding that behavior\nand the social connection that may form\nas a result of the resonance. In the next\nessay, Steve Small discusses these neural\nmechanisms and how they may be\nimportant in helping us understand\nspoken language and possibly in\nunderstanding social behavior.\nPage | 75\nChapter 8 8\n8 The lead author is Steven L.

Language is the defining feature of our\nspecies: In his 12 th century volume, Guide to the\nPerplexed, Maimonides viewed it as tautological\nthat man is a speaking animal, i.e., “there is no\nthird element besides life and speech in the\ndefinition of man”. But how does the brain\nimplement this unique function in the context of\nits common ontogeny with social function? The\ncurrent essay discusses the possibility that the\nrecently discovered “mirror neurons” of the\ncerebral cortex of macaque monkeys play a\nspecial role in the ability of humans to\nunderstand each other with language by using a\nmechanism of observation and covert emulation.\nIf the neurobiology of language were partly\ngrounded on such systems of visual observation\nand imitation, this would overlap integrally with\nthe biology of the social brain.\nHidden Forces in Understanding\nOthers:\nMirror Neurons and Neurobiological\nUnderpinnings\nIt is one thing to perceive objects\nin the environment and another to\nunderstand what is perceived. A rodent\nthat senses an apple definitely has a\nnotion that this represents something\nedible. A monkey might realize that the\napple can be eaten but also can be\nthrown. A human might perceive it as a\nfood, an object to be propelled, a\ntemptation that should be resisted, or\nsomething that falls out of a tree at a\nspecific acceleration. For each individual\nanimal or person, understanding an apple\nmeans to take the sensory perceptions of\nthe apple and to use previous experience\nand knowledge to fit it into an overall\ncontext. In this way, understanding a\nparticular apple depends on our\npreviously having seen, touched, and\nsmelled apples, eaten them, read about\nthem, and perhaps even been hit by a\nfalling or thrown apple. All of our\nprevious experiences come to bear every\ntime we encounter a new perception that\nwe must make sense of, and of course,\nthis represents virtually every moment of\nour waking lives.\nOur perceptions vary enormously\nfrom seeing simple objects (e.g., apples),\ntaking in more complex entities (e.g.,\nrestaurants, neighborhoods), hearing\nnoises or speech, and seeing actions\n(e.g., simple manual actions, sporting\nevents). A major question for brain\nresearch is how we can possibly\nunderstand all these different kinds of\ninput, and what brain circuits are used to\ndo so. We assume that such an\nunderstanding means taking these inputs,\nweighing them against our previous\nPage | 76\nexperiences in some way or other, and\nthen integrating in some way the new\nand old together. This integration\nrequires constant and dynamic changes\nto the brain structures that represent\nwhat we know and how we use it. 1 One\nway this could happen is that when we\nperceive something new, we actually reenact\nin our mind’s eye the previous\nrelated perceptions. For example, if we\nencounter an apple – having encountered\nmany previously -- perhaps we actually\nimagine (seeing) one or more previous\napples or episodes involving apples, or\nimagine (performing) one or more\ninstances of biting an apple or throwing\none, and/or imagine tasting and smelling\none. We might also imagine hearing the\nword “apple”, producing the sounds of\nthe word, seeing the written form of the\nword, or even hearing, seeing, or\nproducing synonyms or related words in\nour first (e.g., “Granny Smith”) or\nsecond (e.g., “pomme”) languages. We\npropose that understanding an apple is\ntantamount to executing this entire set of\nprocesses, and thus, that the circuits for\nunderstanding are very complicated and\ntake up a large portion of the brain.\nOf course, not all of what we\nunderstand is directly available to the\nsenses; we can clearly understand beliefs\nand emotions as well as physical objects\nand overt actions. Brain researchers\ngenerally take the view that previous\nexperience guides understanding of\nabstract concepts in much the same way\nthat it guides the understanding of the\nmore concrete entities. For example, we\ncan understand the emotional states of\nother people by imagining being in those\nstates ourselves. When I see someone\nfeeling happy or sad, I can evoke\nexamples from my own previous\nexperience of feeling happy or sad\n(perhaps even for the same reasons), and\nby feeling the emotion, I can understand\nit. The closer my previous experience is\nto the perceived one, the better the\n“understanding”. This principle holds\nwhether one is trying to understand\nobjects or people. An important\ndistinction between people and objects\nwhen trying to understand their actions\nis that people, but not objects, have\nintentions.\nThe Social Brain\nThe critical question for\nneurobiologists is how does the brain\nunderstand. In particular, we want to\nknow whether the same brain circuits\nthat are used when we experience things\npersonally are also used when we try to\nunderstand another person having the\nsame experiences, whether these\nexperiences are concrete, like grasping a\ncup or hitting a baseball, or more\nabstract like feeling sad or fearful or in\npain. We also want to know whether\nunderstanding the simple concrete\nperceptions and these highly complex\nemotional states are mediated similarly\nin the brain. Further, we are interested in\nthe overlap between conscious and\nunconscious understanding and shared or\npersonal understanding. One way to\naddress these questions is to examine the\nbrain structures responsible for specific\ntypes of personal sensations, actions, and\ncognitive processes, and to see if these\nsame ones play a role when individuals\nattempt to understand these functions in\nothers. Using modern techniques of\nphysiology, experiments of this type\nhave been conducted in both monkeys\nand humans, with some surprising\nresults.\nIt is now possible to measure\nbrain activity of humans while having a\nwide range of different kinds of\nexperiences. Such human neuroimaging\nPage | 77\nexperiments have suggested that\nunderstanding actions and objects invoke\nsome of the same brain structures used\nto perform the actions and to act on the\nobjects. With respect to actions in\nparticular, humans sometimes use their\nown motor repertoire in interpreting\nactions, possibly by imagining or\nmentally simulating the perceived\naction. When people are asked to\nobserve the actions of others,\nparticularly goal-directed actions\ninvolving the hands or mouth, they seem\nto activate brain regions for moving the\nhands or mouth. Thus, there is a link\nbetween observing actions and executing\nactions. This has a relevance to\neducation as well: “Understanding by\ndoing” (i.e., by observing and then\nexecuting) has a long and valued\ntradition in American education 2 , and\nthese recent scientific results might help\nus understand why this is effective.\nWhen my son was 5 years old, he\nwas a member of a kids’ soccer team in\nHyde Park, on the campus of the\nUniversity of Chicago. His coach was a\nprofessor of history at the university, a\nwoman who had never played soccer,\nbut was a voracious reader, and in her\nreadings on the subject, took careful note\nof all the methods needed to play soccer\nas well as the rules and regulations. She\nmethodically took the kids through all\nthe (theoretically relevant motor) steps\nneeded to dribble the ball, to pass, and to\nshoot – flex your foot this way, bend\nyour leg that way, keep your arms this\nway, etc. The kids tried to follow the\nverbal instructions but their motor\nperformance was less than stellar – they\nlearned a little bit, but they lost all of\ntheir dozen games, for a depressing 0-12\nrecord. The next season, the same team\nwas coached by another volunteer\nparent, this time an engineer from\nTrinidad, who had played soccer his\nwhole life. The instructions he gave the\nkids were quite different: “Follow me\nand do what I do”. There were no\nsuggested foot flexions or extensions,\nand no specific leg movements\nproposed. The kids learned the skills,\nand won all their games. Why? The kids\nlearned by observing a good model and\nthen imitating what they observed the\nperson doing, which appears to be a way\nto learn motor skills that is far stronger\nthan that of explicit motor instruction.\nWhen people have strokes, a part\nof their brain dies, and they can lose the\nability to speak or use a hand properly.\nWe are now using this idea of imitation\nin a treatment program to re-educate\npeople with strokes to use their hands\nbetter and to pronounce words better.\nFor these imitation-based treatments,\npeople first observe a particular hand\naction or speech sample on a video\nmonitor, and then they try to produce it.\nIn fact, they observe it over and over\nagain for a while before they even try to\ndo it at all. They are never told how to\nmove their hands or mouths; they are\njust told to copy what they see. Over the\ncourse of six weeks, people with hand\nproblems progress from imitating a\nsimple grasp of a cup to picking up a\ntelephone and dialing a number to\npicking up a toothbrush, brushing their\nteeth, and returning the brush to the sink.\nThose with speech problems progress\nfrom imitating simple words of a single\nsyllable to longer less common words\nand even short phrases. We have already\nshown that these therapies have\nbeneficial effects in a number of people\nand are now trying it out more\nextensively.\nThere seems to be an important\nlink between observing and executing\nactions. Similarly, there is a link\nPage | 78\nbetween observing action and\nunderstanding emotion. This link has\nbeen most clearly demonstrated in the\ncase of facial expressions – if I observe\nthe muscles of the face in a position to\nconvey an emotional state, clearly I\nperceive the emotion. What has been\nshown recently is that observing such\nfacial expressions leads to two kinds of\nbrain activations in the observer: The\nfirst set of regions activated are those\nthat would be used by the observer to\nexecute the identical face movements,\njust as with hand or mouth movements.\nHowever, additional regions are also\nactive, and these are precisely the ones\nthat would be involved if the observer\nwere to feel the observed emotion\npersonally. Thus the circuitry for action\nobservation in the human brain is\ninterdependent with parts of the brain\ncritical for understanding more complex\nnuanced aspects of the world.\nMirror Neurons\nIt turns out that there may be\ncellular building blocks in the brain that\nare particularly important for observing\nand executing actions, and may\nultimately lead to an explanation of\naction understanding and imitationbased\nlearning. In fact, such structures\nwould contribute to any form of\nunderstanding that could be partly\nexplained by imagined re-enactment of\nperceived actions (e.g., seeing an\nemotional facial expression, hearing a\ncry of pain). The cells under discussion\nare a type of nerve cell, or neuron,\ndiscovered in the front part of the\nmonkey brain by Professor Giacomo\nRizzolatti and his colleagues at the\nUniversity of Parma. The scientists\ntrained monkeys to perform specific\nactions like grasping an object or licking\ntheir lips, and were performing electrical\nrecordings in regions in the front of the\nbrain known to coordinate movements.\nThese recording machines note brain\nactivity both visually, as a graph on a\nscreen, and auditorily, by a loud series of\nclicks, indicating the firing of a neuron.\nRizzolatti and his team were focusing on\na particular region in the front of the\nbrain, and were having the monkey\nperform all sorts of hand, mouth, and\neye movements to see how the brain\ncells were organized to make these\nmovements happen. One day (or so the\nstory goes), one of the researchers\nreturned from lunch while the electrical\nrecordings were being made, and was\nfinishing off a cone of superb Italian\ngelato, when all of a sudden the\nrecording device starting making a loud\nseries of clicks. The returning scientist\nstopped licking his ice cream cone to see\nwhat was going on, and the noise\nstopped. When he restarted licking his\ngelato, the clicks resumed, and when he\nstopped again, they stopped. The\ninvestigators had discovered a type of\nneuron that was sensitive to the monkey\nobserving a particular human action.\nIt was not surprising that\nfollowing training to perform an action,\nsome neurons in the motor region of the\nbrain responded while performing that\naction, when the same neurons would\nnot have responded beforehand.\nHowever, it was extremely surprising to\nfind that some of those neurons also\nresponded vigorously when the monkey\nobserved the very same learned actions.\nThrough a methodical and systematic\napproach, this group was able to make a\nmore elaborate and far-reaching set of\nobservations. For a small subset of\nneurons, if a monkey had learned to\nreach for a particular object, seeing\nanother monkey reach for the same\nobject would cause the neuron to fire.\nFor a different subset of neurons, if the\nPage | 79\nmonkey had learned to pucker up his\nlips, the neuron would fire both when the\nmonkey did this or when the monkey\nobserved another monkey (or even a\nhuman) doing this. These motor neurons\nhave been dubbed “mirror neurons”,\nsince they respond during both execution\nof action and during observation of the\nsame action in a mirror-like fashion. 3\nMirror neurons are not active during\nobservation of an appropriate action if\nthere is no goal (i.e., the object is absent)\nor when an appropriate object is\npresented alone. Mirror neurons have\nbeen discovered both for mouth actions\nand hand actions, and for both visual and\nauditory perception of actions.\nSeeing a previously learned\naction performed by someone else seems\nto resonate in some neurons in the motor\nsystem almost as if the action were being\nperformed by the observer. It is as if the\nobserved action stimulates some motor\nneurons to “remember” what it was like\nto perform action. Of course, this is not\nmemory in the overt sense of conscious\nrecollection, but rather that the\nexperience of execution changes the\nresponse of the neurons to observation.\nNot all the motor neurons respond this\nway but a small number have been\nshown to respond when performing and\nobserving an action. Such mirror\nneurons could provide a correspondence\nbetween the experience one has of\nperforming an action and seeing the\nsame action performed by others.\nThese mirror neurons might\nprovide one basis for understanding\naction. Relating actions we observe to\nactions we have carried out seems like\nan important component for\ncomprehension. After all, we knew what\nwe were doing when we performed an\naction. If that experience is somehow\nreinstated during observation we might\nattribute our past experience as the\ninterpretation of the present observation.\nImitation when observing an action\nmight occur because our motor system is\nstimulated by observing an action.\nCoordination of action could occur\nbecause in representing others’ actions\nas if they were our own, our brains may\nbe able to compute the time when we\ncan act without disrupting the other\nperson. This is just the kind of process\nthat is described in Gun Semin’s chapter\nwhen he describes how groups of people\ncan synchronize their actions like\nclapping together.\nFrom monkey brains to human\nintention\nOf course, relating responses in\nmonkey brains to human brains is\nneither direct nor simple. Parts of the\nmonkey brain and and parts of the\nhuman brain that putatively correspond,\nwhile similar, are not identical in\nnumber or size or location, and probably\ndo not do exactly the same things, since\nmonkeys and humans have evolved to\nhave somewhat different capacities and\nbehaviors. Furthermore, the study of\nmirror neurons in monkeys is based on\nrecording the responses of individual\nneurons, which is not generally possible\nin humans except in rare cases of\nmedical necessity. The measures we can\nmake on intact human brains come from\nthe responses of many thousands of\nneurons, so it is difficult to make claims\nabout neurons that respond in producing\nan action and perceiving the same\naction. This means that any claims about\nhuman mirror neurons depend on a\ndegree of good faith and inference rather\nthan specific empirical demonstration\nthat individual neurons respond both to\nobserving and executing action.\nPage | 80\nResearchers have measured\nhuman brain responses using a variety of\nmethods such as functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI), which\ndemonstrate reliable effects of changes\nin neural activity by changes in blood\nflow. Although slower to respond than\nmeasures of electrical activity, fMRI\nprovides evidence about where neural\nactivity in the human brain occurs. This\nkind of research does show that\nobserving action produces activity in\nareas of the human brain more typically\nassociated with executing action. While\nthere may be some disagreement about\nwhich motor areas of the human brain\nare active while observing or imitating\naction and how these would correspond\nto areas in the monkey brain, there is\ngood agreement that the human motor\nsystem responds for observation and\nimitation of action. 4\nThere is quite a difference\nbetween recognizing an action and\nunderstanding that action. We can see a\nhand move through space with an open\npalm oriented with the flat of the palm\nmoving toward the surface of an object\nand predict where the hand will strike\nthe object and that it will apply force to\nthe surface of that object. But\nunderstanding the same general action as\npushing a door open with the intent to\nenter and slapping a person in the face is\nquite different. A ball can be thrown in a\ngame of catch or as a missile intended to\ndo harm. The actions may be similar but\nthe intentions are different. Therefore it\nis important that some researchers have\nargued that mirror neurons respond to\nthe intention as well as the action. 5\nHowever, to date there has been no clear\nevidence that such neurons respond to\nintention -- just that the sight of the\naction of reaching without an object to\ngrasp, the sight of the object alone, and\nthe sight of the action with the object\npresent show different patterns of brain\nresponse. The fact that such different\nvisual experiences lead to different\npatterns of brain activity does not\nprovide clear evidence that intentions or\ngoals are somehow part of the mirror\nneuron response to observed action.\nUnderstanding spoken language as\naction understanding\nThe potential ambiguity of action\nis perhaps clearest if we consider\nlanguage. Talking is a form of action and\nunderstanding speech might be a form of\naction understanding. In talking, mouth\nmovements are made in such a way as to\ncreate sounds that will have some affect\non the listener, as discussed in Howard\nNusbaum’s chapter. Listeners must\nunderstand what was meant by making\nthose sounds. However, if someone says,\n“It’s hot in here,” or “You are a great\nfriend,” there can be ambiguity about the\nmeaning. Such sentences could be\nstraightforward observations as they\nseem to be or they could be something\nvery different. We can ask to have a\nwindow opened or we can make a\nnegative social comment using exactly\nthe same sentences.\nNonetheless, there is good reason\nto believe that the human action system\nis involved in understanding speech as\nwell as producing it. While some\nambiguities in speech or behavior simply\ncannot be resolved without broader\ncontextual knowledge, the motor system\nmay be important in understanding. If\nyou try to have a conversation in a noisy\nbar, looking at your friend talking makes\nit easier to understand what is being said.\nWe have shown that the motor system\ncontributes to this process of recognizing\nspeech. When listeners can see\nsomeone’s face while talking, mouth\nPage | 81\nmovements increase activity within the\nmotor system measured using fMRI.\nFurthermore, it is possible to show that\nthe same parts of the motor system can\nbe active in talking and in understanding\nspeech. By analyzing which parts of the\nbrain are active and when they become\nactive, it is possible to show that when\nmotor system activity in the frontal lobe\nof the brain precedes activity in other\nregions (e.g., the temporal lobe),\nlisteners have a better understanding. 6 It\nis as if the motor system “recognizes”\nthe speech before other parts of the brain\nwhen the talking mouth is visible to the\nlistener.\nThis study shows that more\ninformation about the action of\nproducing speech (visible mouth\nmovements) can activate the motor areas\nof the brain during understanding of\nspeech. But it is also the case that\nunderstanding speech without seeing the\nspeaker depends on the motor system.\nHockey players are experts at hitting\nslap shots, blocking passes, and\nwhacking each other in the head with\nhockey sticks. They have done these\nthings in the real world just as monkeys\nin Parma have learned to reach for\ncertain objects. When hockey players\nlisten to sentences describing hockey\naction, even without seeing the speaker\nor the action, motor areas are active\nduring sentence understanding and these\nsame motor areas are not active in\npeople without hockey experience. 7\nUnderstanding described actions appears\nto be influenced by the motor systems of\npeople who have experience with those\nactions. Understanding action may be\ninfluenced by the experiences of our\nmotor systems.\nReading minds through action\nIn understanding other people,\nwe start with what we understand about\nourselves. As Nick Epley describes in\nhis chapter, we take this kind of\negocentric perspective in understanding\nother people or pets or God or the\nbehavior of inanimate objects. We know\nwhat we meant when we say something\nor do something and we make the same\nattribution to others, even nonhuman\nothers. While this may be a good starting\npoint for religions to help people feel\nconnected to God, as discussed by Clark\nGilpin, it may not be uniformly\ninformative about human behavior.\nBehavior is not transparent for the\nintention of that behavior. The fact that\nany particular action is not necessarily\nunique to the intent behind it is the basis\nof a great deal of misunderstanding in\ndaily interactions. As a result, even if\nmirror neurons help our brains recognize\nactions and sometimes interpret them,\nthere are real limits to how experienceproducing\nactions can correctly inform\nsocial understanding.\nIn spite of this limitation, we\nmay often do just this—assume we\nunderstand another’s actions because of\nwhat we would intend were we to do the\nsame thing in the same circumstance.\nHuman social understanding does suffer\negocentric limitations often and to the\nextent that it does, something like a\nmirror neuron system may play a role.\nFor example, as discussed by Jean\nDecety in his chapter, our ability to\nunderstand the pain of others may derive\nin part from the neural systems involved\nin our experience of pain, but goes\nbeyond this starting point. The social\nbrain is on one level perhaps a very\negocentric brain. But the fundamental\nmotivation to connect with others has\nresulted in systems built on top of these\negocentric foundations. If social\nPage | 82\nunderstanding depended entirely on past\nexperiences of our own intentions and\nactions, there might be much more\nmisunderstanding and cynicism in the\nworld. However, the capacity to reason,\nhypothesize, and model possible futures\nmay increase social understanding\nbeyond the anchor of purely egocentric\nperspective. We can conceive of\nalternatives to our own goals and\nmotives and relate those alternatives to\nthe actions we observe. To some extent,\nthis process might also involve the motor\nsystem by mentally simulating actions\nand anticipated responses. By imagining\nhow we might act in some situation to\nachieve a goal or the alternative ways we\nmay act given some intention, it may be\npossible to go beyond the limits of our\nown experience. Such constructive\nimagery may well depend on the motor\nsystem, along with other neural systems,\nbut currently there is no scientific\nevidence that such a system might be\nlinked with the operation of mirror\nneurons.\nConclusion\nWe are equipped to understand\nthe world around us by relating what we\nperceive to our own experiences. With\nrespect to actions in particular, our\nbrains have specialized circuitry to relate\npreviously executed actions to newly\nperceived ones, possibly by performing\nan internal (imagined) simulation of\nthem. There is evidence too that we\nmight understand the emotional states of\nothers by a similar kind of process,\nwhereby our brains activate circuits for\nexperiencing the emotion as a way to\nunderstand that emotion in others. These\nbrain mechanisms might also apply (to a\ngreater or lesser degree) when we try to\nunderstand actions or feelings by nonhuman\nanimals or even inanimate\nentities. This could be a partial\nbiological explanation of\nanthropomorphism, as discussed by\nEpley and Gilpin. Of course as humans\nwe have the ability to go beyond these\nstrict egocentric limitations and\nrecognize and respond to our social\nconnections more explicitly. This ability\nto go beyond the more basic grounding\nof the way we understand others may\nsubserve part of the goal of some\nreligions, discussed by Kathryn Tanner,\nin fostering a more abstract view of our\nconnection to others. While a mirror\nneuron system might help form the basis\nfor some aspects of social understanding,\nthere may well be other invisible forces\nat work supported by these and other\nneural systems in our social brain.\nReferences\n1.

As a result, our\nbiological nature is tuned primarily to\nsocial signals and interaction that occurs\nin the presence of another. It takes just\na moment of observation for us to know\na lot about another person as a social\nbeing. We can understand other\nspeakers easily within tens of\nmilliseconds of experience. Our brains\nhave developed to make this kind of\nsocial connection quickly and easily,\nwhether through language or action. In\norder to understand someone else, we\nneed to be able to understand their goals\nand intentions. Moreover we need to\nrelate their behavior to our own\nindividual and personal experience.\nSteve Small discusses some of the brain\nmachinery that may allow us to translate\nour perception of language and\nobservation of behavior into a form that\ncan be related to our own use of\nlanguage and action. This kind of\nresonance with experience, rather than\nelaborate inferences, may allow us to\nconnect quickly with others, satisfying\nour drive for sociality.\nBut understanding behavior and\ncommunication is not all there is to\nforming social connections. It is one\nthing to read intentions and another to\nfeel someone’s pain. If we only could\nunderstand action and communication,\nan important element of human\nconnection would be missing. In\nforming a collective mind, as Gün Semin\ndiscusses it, we need to have collective\nemotional responses. Jean Decety\ndiscusses the foundations of empathy\nand the brain machinery that supports\nthis important capacity by providing a\nresonant response to the observation of\nanother person’s distress. Although\nsympathy may motivate helping others,\nempathy may be one of the social glues\nthat binds us together as a collective\nsocial organism.\nPage | 85\nChapter 9 9\nEmpathy and Interpersonal\nSensitivity\nA young girl, after watching a\ntelevised documentary account of child\nhunger and suffering in Bangladesh,\npleads with her parents to “do\nsomething” to help them.

Decety has\npublished more than 115 scientific papers, and\nrecently edited the Social Neuroscience of\nEmpathy (2009, MIT press), and Interpersonal\nSensitivity: Entering Others’ World (2007,\nPsychology Press).\nEmpathy and sympathy play crucial\nroles in much of human social interaction and are\nnecessary components for healthy co-existence.\nSympathy is thought to have a key role in\nmotivating prosocial behavior, guides our\npreferences and behavioral responses, and\nprovides the affective and motivational base for\nmoral development. Although the study of these\nabilities has traditionally been examined using\nbehavioral and clinical methods, recent work in\nsocial neuroscience has begun to provide\ncompelling and novel insights on the neural\nmechanisms involved in interpersonal\nsensitivity. These developments are explored in\nthis essay.\ndaycare is being ignored by the other\nchildren with the exception of one little\nboy who takes her hand and includes her\nin all his activities. These modest\nbeginnings signal the important and\nongoing role of empathy for surviving\nand flourishing in our social world.\nEmpathy has been suggested to be\nessential to navigating the social world;\nit enhances our understanding of others,\nimproves the effectiveness of our social\ncommunication, and fosters mutually\nsatisfying social relationships.\nConversely, lack of empathy or its\nmaladaptive use causes social\nrelationships to falter and fail.\nEmpathy refers to our natural\ncapacity to quickly and automatically\nrelate to the emotional states of another\nperson. Rudimentary forms of empathy\nappear early in the life course, and with\nmaturation, empathy can be experienced\nby simply reading about or imagining\nsomeone else’s emotion. Empathy\ncomes so naturally that physicians must\nlearn to dampen their empathic pain\nresponses when inserting a needle into a\npatient (1). Just because empathy comes\nnaturally does not mean, however, that it\nis instantiated in a discrete brain module\nthat is automatically activated when one\nwitnesses another’s distress or suffering.\nRather, the experience of empathy is\nunderpinned by the combined activity of\nseveral dissociable psychobiological\nsystems. Further, empathy can be\nmodulated by various contextual,\ndispositional, and interpersonal factors.\nThe study of empathy, using\nsophisticated methods from psychology,\nneurology, neuroimaging, and\nneuropsychology, provide a unique\nopportunity to understand the invisible\npower of empathy in shaping our\nobligatorily gregarious social nature.\nDefining empathy and its functions\nPage | 86\nEmpathy can be defined as our\nnatural capacity to share, appreciate, and\nrespond to the affective states of others.\nThis capacity is essential for the\nregulation of social interactions. For\ninstance, empathy is believed to\nmotivate prosocial behavior and inhibit\naggressive behavior (2). In addition, our\nability to share the emotions of those we\nobserve binds us to each other and\nfosters a collective social identity.\nEmpathy’s invisible power is that it\nmoves us to cooperate, coordinate our\nbehaviors, and provide the needed care\nfor one another. Notably, however,\nempathic concern does not necessarily\nlead to empathic behavior. First,\nempathy poses a paradox, as sharing of\nfeelings does not necessarily imply that\none will act or even feel impelled to act\nin a supportive or sympathetic way.\nSecond, the complexity of the social and\nemotional situations eliciting empathic\nconcern influences the probability and\nnature of the help provided. Whether and\nhow empathic actions are expressed\ndepends on the feelings we perceive in\nthe other, our relationship with that\nindividual, and the context in which we\nshare an emotional state.\nEmpathy is critical for complex\nhuman interactions, but this does not\nmean that empathy and prosocial\nbehavior have suddenly appeared with\nHomo sapiens. If empathy is a potent\ninvisible force generated by the social\nbrain, some form of emotion-sharing\nshould also be evident in other social\nspecies such as non-human primates.\nIndeed, field observations conducted by\ncomparative psychologists and\nethologists suggest that behaviors\nhomologous to empathy can be found in\nnon-human primates (2). Some have\nargued that empathy is not an all-ornothing\nphenomenon, and that many\nintermediate forms of empathy exist\nbetween the extremes of mere agitation\nat the distress of another and full\nunderstanding of their predicaments (3).\nMany comparative psychologists view\nempathy as a kind of induction process\nby which emotions, both positive and\nnegative, are shared, and which increase\nthe probability that the protagonists will\nsubsequently engage in similar behavior.\nThough certain non-human\nprimates may share feelings between\nindividuals, humans seem to have the\nunique ability to intentionally “feel for”\nand act on behalf of other individuals\nwhose experiences may differ greatly\nfrom their own. Such a capacity may\nhelp explain why empathic concern is\noften associated with prosocial behaviors\nsuch as helping kin, and why it has been\nconsidered the foundation for altruism,\nthe expression of empathy and caring for\nthose who are not kin. Evolutionary\nbiologists have suggested that empathic\nhelping behavior evolved because of its\ncontribution to genetic fitness (kin\nselection). In humans and other\nmammals, an impulse to care for\noffspring is almost certainly genetically\nhard-wired. Less clear, however, is\nwhether an impulse to care for siblings,\nmore remote kin, and similar non-kin is\ngenetically hard-wired. The emergence\nof altruism is not easily explained within\nthe framework of neo-Darwinian\ntheories of natural selection (but see\nCacioppo’s chapter on this point). Social\nlearning explanations of kinship patterns\nin human helping behavior are thus\nhighly plausible. Indeed, one of the most\nstriking aspects of human empathy is\nthat it can be felt for virtually any\n“target,” even targets of a different\nspecies (animals included). We can see\na deer hurt by a passing car or the dogs\nlocked in crates at a shelter and feel\nPage | 87\nstrongly for their pain or confinement\nand future. In part, this kind of empathic\nextension may be motivated by the kind\nof anthropomorphic attitudes we have\nabout non-human entities as discussed\nby Nick Epley in his chapter. The fact\nthat we are adept at “feeling for” very\ndifferent others whom we can observe\nbut not truly understand suggests that we\npossess a capacity to cognitively rerepresent\nothers in our mind in a way we\ncan understand. Indeed, second-order\nrepresentation is a key component of\nempathy in humans, and may be a useful\nadaptation for human survival because it\nmaximizes the range of individuals with\nwhom we can form a social bond.\nThe Components of Empathy\nThe psychological components\nthat make up full-blown empathy are\nsupported by distinct and separable\npsychobiological systems. Empathy can\nbe decomposed into an affective\ncomponent that includes the perception\nand sharing of an emotional state\nobserved in another individual, and a\ncognitive component that includes the\nmotivation and intention to respond.\nClosely related is a regulatory\ncomponent that involves adjustment of\none’s emotional and behavioral\nresponse. The affective, cognitive, and\nregulatory aspects of empathy involve\ninteracting, yet partially non-overlapping\nneural circuits. The initial component in\nthe overall process leading to empathy\ndraws on somatic mimicry, also known\nas “emotion contagion.” This affective\ncomponent of empathy develops earlier\nthan the cognitive component. Affective\nresponsiveness is present at an early age,\nis involuntary, and relies on mimicry and\nlinking of actions perceived in others\nwith actions in oneself (i.e., perceptionaction\ncoupling). For instance,\nnewborns and infants become vigorously\ndistressed shortly after another infant\nbegins to cry. Facial mimicry of basic\nemotional expressions also contributes to\naffective sharing, and this phenomenon\nstarts very early in life, by\napproximately 10 weeks of age. This\nprimitive mimicry mechanism, which\nmay be based on mirror neurons, which\nare sensorimotor neurons found in the\npremotor, motor, and posterior parietal\ncortex of the brain that become active\nwhen observing as well as when\nenacting a behavior as discussed in\nSteven Small’s chapter. This kind of\nmechanism may contribute to the\ndevelopment of empathy in the early\npreverbal period, and continues to\noperate past childhood. There is\nevidence that when we perceive\nemotions and actions of others, we use\nthe same neural circuits as when we\nproduce the same emotions and actions\nourselves (e.g., watching another\nindividual being disgusted and\nexperiencing disgust in oneself activate\nsimilar neural circuits). For instance,\nviewing facial expressions triggers\nexpressions on one’s own face, even\nwithout explicit identification of what\nwe’re seeing (4).\nThe cognitive component of\nempathy is closely related to processes\ninvolved in “theory of mind” (i.e., the\nability to attribute mental states to others\nand to understand that others’ mental\nstates can differ from one’s own) and\nself-regulation. The capacity for two\npeople to resonate with each other\nemotionally, prior to any cognitive\nunderstanding, is the basis for\ndeveloping shared emotional meanings,\nbut it is not enough for mature empathic\nunderstanding and concern. Such an\nunderstanding requires the observer to\nform an explicit representation of the\nfeelings of another person, a process that\nPage | 88\ninvolves additional mechanisms beyond\nthe sharing of emotion and includes selfregulatory\nmechanisms to modulate the\nobserver’s experience of negative\narousal. Specifically, in order to\nunderstand the emotions and feelings of\nothers in relation to oneself, secondorder\nrepresentations of the other must\nbe consciously available and must not\nconfuse the other with the self. The\nmedial and ventromedial prefrontal\ncortices are known to play crucial roles\nin decoupling first-person and thirdperson\ninformation and maintaining\nrepresentations of the other as distinct\nfrom the self (5).\nThe regulatory component of\nempathy, especially regulation of\ninternal emotional states and processes,\nis particularly relevant to the modulation\nof vicarious emotion and the experience\nof empathy as well as sympathy.\nEmpathy is unlikely to lead to helping\nbehavior if the observer is incapacitated\nby strong empathically evoked emotions,\nwhich is why emotional regulation is an\nimportant component in empathy.\nIndeed, children high in effortful control\nshow greater empathic concern, and the\ntendency to experience empathy and\nsympathy versus personal distress varies\nas a function of their ability to regulate\ntheir emotions more generally.\nHow We Perceive Other People in\nPain\nWhen witnessing another person\nexperiencing pain, the scope of an\nobserver’s reaction can range from\nconcern for personal safety, including\nfeelings of alarm, fear, and avoidance, to\nconcern for the other person, including\ncompassion, sympathy, and care-giving.\nThe existence of the perception-action\ncoupling mechanism apparent in\nemotional contagion also seems to\naccount for our ability to perceive and\nunderstand the pain of others. In the case\nof pain, individuals are predisposed to\nfind distress of others aversive and learn\nto avoid actions associated with this\ndistress. This is even the case in many\nmammalian species, including rodents.\nFor instance, rats that had learned to\npress a lever to obtain food would stop\ndoing so if their response was paired\nwith the delivery of an electric shock to\na visible neighboring rat (6).\nRecently, a handful of functional\nneuroimaging studies performed with\nhealthy human volunteers revealed that\nthe same neural circuits implicated in\nprocessing the affective and motivational\naspects of pain in oneself account for the\nperception of pain in others (7). In one\nstudy, participants in a magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) scanner either\nreceived a painful stimulus or, in other\ntrials, observed a signal that their\npartner, who was present in the same\nroom, would receive the same stimulus.\nFirst-hand experience of pain resulted in\nactivation of the somatosensory cortex,\nwhich encodes the way we feel aspects\nof a noxious stimulus such as its bodily\nlocation and intensity. Furthermore, the\nanterior medial cingulate cortex (ACC),\nand the anterior insula were activated\nduring both first-hand pain and the\nanticipated experience of pain in\nsomeone else. These regions are\nresponsible for the affective and\nmotivational processing of noxious\nstimuli such as those aspects of pain that\npertain to desires, urges, or impulses to\navoid or terminate a painful experience.\nA number of other neuroimaging studies\nof empathy for pain in adults as well as\nin children have demonstrated that the\nsomatosensory cortex is not activated\nonly during first-hand pain but is also\nactivated with the perception of other\nPage | 89\npeople in pain. Altogether, there is\nstrong evidence to suggest that\nperceiving the pain of others triggers an\nautomatic somatic sensory-motor\nmirroring mechanism between other and\nself, which activates almost the entire\nneural pain matrix including the\nperiaqueductal gray, a major site in pain\ntransmission and for processing of fear\nand anxiety, and the supplementary\nmotor area that programs defensive\nmovements in response to anticipated\npain. Such a neural resonance\nmechanism provides a functional bridge\nbetween first-person and third-person\ninformation. It is grounded in the\nequivalence of self and other, which\nallows for analogical reasoning, and\noffers a possible, yet partial, route to\nunderstanding others.\nOf course, human empathic\nabilities are more sophisticated than\nsimply yoking perceptions of the self\nand other. In the eighteenth century,\nScottish philosopher and economist\nAdam Smith proposed that through\nimagination, “we place ourselves in his\nsituation… enter as it were into his body,\nand become in some measure the same\nperson with” (8). By means of\nimagination we come to experience\nsensations which are generally similar\nto, although typically weaker than, those\nof the other person. This capacity to\nengage in role-taking has been\ntheoretically linked to the development\nof empathy, moral reasoning, and more\ngenerally, prosocial behavior. Unlike the\nmotor mimicry and emotional contagion\naspect of empathy, perspective-taking\ndevelops later, possibly because it draws\nheavily on the maturation of executive\nfunctions (i.e., processes that serve to\nmonitor and control thought and actions,\nincluding self-regulation, planning,\ncognitive flexibility, response inhibition,\nand resistance to interference), functions\nthat are predominantly centered in the\nprefrontal cortex which continues to\nmature from birth to adolescence.\nTheoretically, imagining the other is\ndistinct from imagining the self: the\nformer may evoke empathic concern\n(defined as an other-oriented response\ncongruent with the perceived distress of\nthe person in need) while the latter\ninduces both empathic concern and\npersonal distress (i.e., a self-oriented\naversive emotional response such as\nanxiety or discomfort). This distinction\nhas been supported empirically. When\nindividuals are asked to imagine how\nthey would feel in reaction to emotionladen\nfamiliar situations and to imagine\nhow a known person would feel if she\nwas experiencing the same situations,\ncommon neural circuits are activated\nboth for the self and the other. However,\nrelative to imagining the self, imagining\nthe other results in specific activation of\nparts of the frontal cortex that are\nimplicated in executive control—the use\nof attention and working memory and\ndecisions—and an area of the brain at\nthe interface of the temporal and parietal\nlobes of the brain that is a key\ncomponent of a larger network of neural\ncircuits involved in attention (sometimes\ncalled the temporoparietal junction).\nSome researchers have\nhypothesized that the role of the frontal\nlobes and the temporoparietal junction is\nto hold separate perspectives or to resist\ninterference against attention to one’s\nown perspective. In a recent functional\nbrain imaging study (9), participants\nwere shown pictures of people with their\nhands or feet in painful or non-painful\nsituations with the instruction to imagine\nthemselves or to imagine another\nindividual experiencing these situations.\nDuring perception of painful situations,\nPage | 90\nboth the self-perspective and the otherperspective\nwere associated with\nactivation in the neural network involved\nin pain processing. These results reveal\nthe similarities in neural networks\nrepresenting first- and third-person\ninformation. In addition, however, the\nself-perspective yielded higher pain\nratings and involved more extensive\nactivation of some circuits in the pain\nmatrix than did the other-perspective,\nthus highlighting important differences\nbetween self- and other-perspectives.\nNeuroanatomical regions and\ncircuits form the foundation for the\nexperience of pain in others, but they are\nnot sufficient to explain variability in\ninterpersonal sensitivity. Although\nempathetic brain circuits are activated by\nthe mere perception of pain in others,\nactivity in these circuits can be\nmodulated by social, motivational, and\ncognitive factors. For example,\nobserving pain in likable others (i.e.,\nthose who played a game fairly) resulted\nin an enhancement of empathic brain\nresponses, whereas pain in dislikable\nothers who played unfairly did not.\nAnother functional MRI study (10)\nfound that participants showed\nsignificantly greater responses in neural\nregions that are involved in pain\nperception when observing the pain of\npeople who were not responsible for\ntheir stigmatized condition (i.e.,\nindividuals who contracted AIDS as the\nresult of a blood transfusion) than either\ncontrols (healthy individuals) or people\nwho were held responsible for their\ncondition (i.e., those who contracted\nAIDS through illegal drug use). In\naddition, participants expressed more\nempathy and personal distress in\nresponse to the pain of people who were\nnot responsible for their stigmatized\ncondition as compared to controls. The\nlevel of empathic response, therefore,\nseems to be influenced by motivational\nfactors as well as the interpersonal\nrelationship between the target and the\nobserver.\nAltogether, these findings\ndemonstrate that the similarities between\naffective representations of the self and\nthe other stem from shared neural\ncircuits that can be emulated either\nautomatically or intentionally by the act\nof perspective-taking. Importantly, these\nfindings also point to some distinctions\nbetween these two representations,\ndistinctions that contribute to our\ncapacity to detach ourselves from others\nsufficiently to make considered\nresponses to their pain.\nConclusion\nEmpathy, the natural capacity to\nshare, appreciate, and respond to the\naffective states of others, plays a crucial\nrole in much of human social interaction\nfrom birth to the end of life. As would be\nexpected if empathy functions to\nenhance social cohesion, social nonhuman\nprimate species also exhibit\nrudimentary versions of empathy. What\nhumans have in abundance are higherlevel\ncognitive and social abilities\n(language, theory of mind, executive\nfunctions) that can be deployed to\nmodulate empathic responses, and that\nare amenable to modulation by lowerlevel\nprocesses such as emotional\ncontagion and mimicry. These levels of\nprocessing enable empathy to have an\nimpact on a wide variety of human\nbehaviors. From motivating prosocial\nbehavior to providing the affective and\nmotivational bases for moral\ndevelopment, empathy is an invisible\nforce to reckon with when considering\nhow humans behave toward each other.\nReferences\nPage | 91\n1.

The possession of empathic\ncapacity is not sufficient to determine\nthe precise nature of the response toward\nothers, however. As Decety points out,\nwhether an individual attends to and\nresponds empathically upon observing\nemotion in another individual depends\non, among other things, dispositional\ntendencies, the relationship between the\nindividuals, and contextual constraints.\nMotivation to help another is also\ninfluenced by the amount of cognitive\neffort we are willing and able to exert to\ntake the perspective of the other.\nPerspective-taking is essentially\nan attempt to see into the invisible mind\nof another. What we can’t see, we model\nbased on our own mind and like-minded\nindividuals. Nick Epley shows that\nseeing into and connecting with other\nminds is such a frequent operation of the\nsocial brain that the absence of others\ninclines people to see human minds in\nnonhuman entities. Whether it’s a tree, a\npet, or God, ascribing mind to others\nendows them with the capacity to\nexperience the same affective states we\nexperience. This shared capacity evokes\nin us a tendency to feel and express\nempathic concern for their well-being.\nUnfortunately, humans do not grant all\nindividuals, much less non-human\nentities, an equivalent degree of mind.\nEpley articulates how differences in the\ncapacity to see mind in others have\nconsequences for the way we feel and\nthink about and behave toward others.\nPage | 93\nChapter 10 10\nSeeing Invisible Minds\nShortly after taking off from\nLaGuardia airport in the dead of winter,\nthe engines of US Airways flight 1549\nfailed after inhaling several large geese.\nThe pilots glided their plane onto the\nHudson River, where all of the\n10 The lead author is Nicholas Epley, Ph.D., a\nProfessor of Behavioral Science at the University\nof Chicago Booth School of Business.

You can even see them in agents\nranging from pets to gadgets to gods. How you\nare able to see other minds, and how they\nbecome visible, matters because it marks the\ndifference between treating others as human\nbeings worthy of moral care and concern versus\ntreating others as objects or animals.\npassengers were rescued, cold, wet, and\nalmost completely unharmed. Explained\none passenger, “God was certainly\nlooking out for us.” New Orleans Mayor\nRay Nagin offered a very different\nassessment of God’s mind following the\ndevastating impact of Hurricane Katrina\nwhen he explained that, “Surely God is\nmad at America. Surely he’s not\napproving of us being in Iraq under false\npretense. But surely he’s upset at Black\nAmerica, too.”\nDepending on your own beliefs,\nsuch statements will seem somewhere\nbetween insane and insightful. To\npsychologists, they seem impressive.\nThey seem impressive not because they\nreveal a keen sense of causal inference,\nbut rather because they reveal what may\nbe the most impressive capacities of the\nsocial brain—the ability to reason about,\nor “to see,” what other minds see.\nIntrospection enables you to know your\nown intentions, report on your own\nthoughts, feel your own pain, and\nrecognize when you are feeling shame\nrather than guilt. Other minds, however,\nare inherently invisible. You cannot\nknow what it is like to be another person\non the inside because your skull gets in\nthe way.\nThe inherent invisibility of other\nminds poses a major problem for hardnosed\nphilosophers, who skeptically note\nthat people cannot infer that other minds\nexist at all. Although it is surprisingly\ndifficult for philosophers to reject the\nskeptical conclusion from the “other\nminds problem,” almost everyone else\ncasts it aside altogether some time\naround the age of five. At this point\npeople have developed such a strong\ncapacity to think about other minds that\nthey not only see minds in other people,\nbut they seem to see other minds almost\neverywhere 1 . Gods can be caring or\nPage | 94\ncallous. Pets can be thoughtful or\ndevious. And every now and then,\ncomputers can have a mind of their own.\nHaving the capacity to reason\nabout other minds enables people to\nform deep social connections with\nothers, to empathize with others’ pain\nand share in their joy, and to anticipate\nothers’ actions. But having a capacity\nand actually using it are two different\nthings. People are not naturally inclined\nto see invisible things in the\nenvironment. People do not\nautomatically see into other minds,\neither, but instead do so only under\ncertain circumstances and with some\npsychological effort. This chapter will\ndescribe how people come to see other\nminds, how other minds can become\nmore or less visible, and why the\nvisibility of other minds matters for\neveryday life.\nKinds of Minds\nStudying how people understand\nother minds first requires understanding\nhow people intuitively define another\nmind. Research suggests that people\nthink of minds as having two distinct\ndimensions, the ability to act (agency)\nand the ability to feel (experience) 2 .\nMindful agency involves the cognitive\nactivities that enable action, such as the\ncapacity to plan, to have intentions, to\nengage in deliberate self-control, and to\npursue one’s own goals. Conscious\npreferences, attitudes, and beliefs follow\nfrom these capacities. Mindful\nexperience, in contrast, involves the\ncognitive activities involved in reacting\nto the external world, such as the\ncapacity for self-awareness, and the\nexperience of basic psychological states\n(like hunger, thirst, or pain), and otheroriented\nemotions (such as empathy or\nsympathy). Mindful experience also\ninvolves the capacity for\nmetacognition—the capacity to think\nabout one’s own thoughts or emotions—\nexemplified in experiences such as\nconfidence and doubt, or in secondary\nemotions such as shame, guilt, joy, or\nhope. People seem to represent these\ntwo capacities in others quite\nindependently. A sociopath, for\ninstance, can appear to act with a high\ndegree of mindful agency but no mindful\nexperience, whereas a baby might appear\nfull of mindful experience with\nrelatively little mindful agency. Seeing\nother agents as mindful essentially\nmeans seeing them as able to\nconsciously think and/or to feel.\nBecause you are aware of both your own\nthoughts and feelings, you likely\nconsider yourself—like most people\ndo—to be very mindful.\nMaking Other Minds Visible\nIntrospection provides a kind of\nflashlight that seems to provide direct\naccess to one’s own agency as well as\nexperience. Although research\ndemonstrates that introspection is\nactually a process of indirect inference,\nit appears to us that introspection\nprovides direct access to the workings of\nour own brain. It seems that we can look\non the inside and feel when we are\nsuffering, know when we are\nexperiencing regret, or be aware of our\nintentions to lose weight. We can use\nour introspective abilities to make\ninferences about what others are likely\nthinking or feeling (and we very often\ndo), but such inferences are likely to\nseem inherently less direct, less\nimmediate, and less illuminating. We\ncannot see into other minds as clearly as\nwe seem able to see our own.\nWhen something is difficult to\nsee, people may doubt whether it\nPage | 95\nactually exists, or may not see it at all.\nThis is true of the relative difficulty that\npeople have seeing other minds\ncompared to one’s own, in ways that are\nsometimes very subtle and surprising.\nFor instance, we tend to evaluate\nourselves by consulting our mindful\nintentions, but we evaluate others (and\ntheir intentions) by observing their\nactions. We may consider ourselves to\nbe conscientious if we planned to buy\nour spouse a birthday gift, but need to\nsee an actual gift to infer that our spouse\nis equally conscientious. 3 We tend to\nbelieve that we are more likely to\nexperience complicated mental emotions\nlike shame, guilt, or embarrassment than\nare others. 4,5 We tend to believe that our\nown behavior will therefore be guided\nby moral sentiments like empathy, guilt,\nor compassion whereas others’ behavior\nis more likely driven by the relatively\nmindless motives of self-interest. 6 Other\nminds are more opaque than our own,\nand some learning, attending, seeking,\nand projecting is required for our brains\nto become fully social and see into them.\nHere’s how 7 .\nLearning. Children do not enter\nthe world able to think about other\nminds, but they learn to do so fairly\nquickly. At around three months of age,\nchildren start preferentially attending to\nanimate objects compared to inanimate\nobjects, and at around six months of age\nstart to distinguish between intentional\n(goal-directed) and unintentional\n(accidental) action. At this age, for\ninstance, children will look reliably\nlonger at a person who is reaching for a\ncup than to a person who is making the\nsame reaching motion in the absence of\na cup. Over the next 18 months,\nchildren become more likely to mimic\nintentional than unintentional actions 8 , to\nfollow the gaze of another person and\ntherefore share his or her attentional\nfocus, and recognize that other people\nmay have preferences that differ from\none’s own. By age two, children’s\nsocial ability to read other minds seems\nto have already surpassed that of our\nnearest primate relatives, and over the\nnext two years they pick up what appear\nto be uniquely human mind-reading\ncapacities. By age five, children\ndemonstrate the most sophisticated of\nmind-reading abilities—the capacity to\nrecognize that others’ beliefs may differ\nfrom one’s own and to use those\ndiffering (sometimes mistaken) beliefs to\npredict the other agent’s behavior.\nVariability from age five onward comes\nfrom learning more specific details about\nhow other minds actually work, largely\ngathered from personal experience,\nreligious practice, or broader cultural\nnorms.\nMany psychologists and\nneuroscientists speculate that learning to\nread other minds comes from the deeply\nsocial tendency, present at birth, to\nmimic others’ actions. For example,\nSteve Small examines a neurological\nunderpinning for mimicry, and Jean\nDecety argues in his essay that an inborn\ncapacity for mimicry underlies the\nhuman capacity for empathy. Looking\nwhere others look and copying their\nactions is a reasonable way to copy their\nlikely mental states as well. This\negocentric method of using one’s own\nmental experience as a guide to other\nminds continues to be employed\nthroughout adulthood, and can give\ninsight into others’ mental states but can\nalso lead people to overestimate the\nextent to which others’ minds are similar\nto one’s own. These biases tend to be\ncalled egocentric when reasoning about\nother people, and they tend to be called\nanthropomorphic when reasoning about\nPage | 96\nnonpeople such as a god or a gadget or a\npet.\nAttending. People rarely notice\nthings in their environment unless they\nare specifically attending to them. Other\nminds likewise tend to be relatively\ninvisible unless attention is specifically\ndrawn to them. For instance, take a\nmoment to think about how happy you\nare compared to the average American…\nNo really, please take a moment…If you\njust spent some time thinking about how\nhappy you are and no time thinking\nabout how happy the average American\nis, then you are no different from the\nmajority of people in psychology\nexperiments who do likewise 8 . People\ncan consider others’ thoughts, feelings,\nbeliefs, or emotions, but doing so\nrequires mental effort that is in short and\nlimited supply. Consider, for instance, a\nsimple experiment in which you are\nplaying a game with another person 9 .\nBoth you and the other player in this\ngame must first choose privately to\ncooperate or compete with each other. If\nyou both choose to cooperate, you both\nearn $5. But if the other player chooses\nto cooperate and you choose to compete,\nthen you win $10 and your partner gets\nnothing. If you, however, choose to\ncooperate and the other player chooses\nto compete, you win nothing and your\npartner wins $10. If you both choose to\ncompete, you both win a measly $2. It\nseems obvious in this situation that you\nshould consider both what you would\nlike to do, but also consider what the\nother player is likely to be thinking.\nExperimental evidence suggests that\npeople do indeed think about the former\nbut spend little time thinking of the\nlatter. In a basic version of this\nexperiment, 60% of people chose to\ncooperate. However, when people were\nsimply asked to think about their\npartner’s thoughts before making their\nchoice, only 27% chose to cooperate. If\npeople had already been thinking about\nothers’ thoughts, as it seems like they\nwould naturally be doing in this\nsituation, then a simple instruction to\nconsider others’ thoughts would have no\neffect on people’s own behavior. That is\nnot the case. This simple experiment\nshows that people may not naturally\nconsider other minds even when it\nappears that they should. Thinking\nabout other minds requires attentional\neffort. It does not necessarily come\nautomatically. Indeed, as Tanya\nLuhrmann describes in her chapter,\npeople may have to work very hard to\ndiscern other minds, such as the mind of\nGod, even when they are actively\nlooking for them.\nSeeking. If seeing other minds\nrequires attention, then other minds are\nespecially likely to become visible when\npeople are motivated to think about\nthem. There are many reasons why\npeople might try to get into the mind of\nanother agent, from a spouse to a pet to a\ngod, but two are reasonably wellsupported\nby existing research. First,\npeople tend to think about other minds\nwhen they are trying to form a social\nconnection with others. 10 Making\npeople feel lonely or isolated, for\ninstance, increases the tendency to\ndescribe one’s pet as thoughtful,\nconsiderate, or sympathetic (all mindful\ntraits). And those who are made to feel\nlonely are also likely to report believing\nin mindful supernatural agents, such as\nGod. Second, people tend to think about\nother minds when they are trying to\nachieve some understanding and control\nover their environment or over another\nagent’s behavior. 1 Concepts of mind,\nincluding attitudes, beliefs, goals, or\ndesires, can provide compelling cause-\nPage | 97\nand-effect explanations of behavior that\ngive a sense of predictability and\ncontrol. A meteorologist may know that\na hurricane may strike here or there\ndepending on environmental conditions.\nLacking such knowledge, a hurricane\nthat strikes here rather than there may\nlead people to invoke a mindful agent—\nsuch as a God—to explain that action.\nProjecting. If introspection\nmakes your own mind visible, then you\nmight assume that those who look\nsimilar to you on the outside might look\nsimilar to you on the inside as well.\nIndeed, animals that move at a\nhumanlike speed (such as a horse) seem\nmore mindful to people than do animals\nthat move either much slower (such as a\nsloth) or much faster (such as a\nhummingbird). 11 And an agent that look\nhumanlike, such as a computerized\navatar with human face, seems more\nmindful than avatars that do not look\nhumanlike. Any parent knows how well\ntoy makers love to capitalize on this\ntendency. But it is the converse of this\neffect that is even more interesting—\nother minds become less visible as the\nagent becomes less similar to the self.\nOthers that differ from you in their\ninterests, nationality, or social status are\nlikely to be seen as less mindful—less\nthoughtful, less likely to experience\ncomplicated emotions, less able to\nexperience pain or suffering—than those\nthat are similar to you. It is little\nwonder, then, that the history of human\nconflict is filled with instances of people\ndehumanizing radically different others,\ntreating them like mindless animals or\nobjects. 12\nWhy Minds Matter\nIt may not be obvious to you why\nit matters that your neighbor, every now\nand then, thinks that her computer has a\nmind of it’s own, that a mayor believes\nthat God punished his city by sending a\nhurricane, or that you truly believe that\nyour pet poodle is thoughtful and\nconsiderate. Some of these attributions\nof mind seem purely metaphorical and\ntherefore unimportant, as ways of\nspeaking rather than ways of believing,\nwhereas others seem to represent\ngenuine beliefs about the real presence\nor absence of another social mind. But\nmetaphors have a way of influencing\nbehavior in ways that are consistent with\nbelieving the metaphor to be literally\ntrue. People metaphorically refer to\nfeeling dirty after behaving unethically,\nand yet washing one’s hands actually\nreduces the guilt that people report\nfeeling from engaging in unethical\nactions. 13 People are surely just\nspeaking metaphorically when they refer\nto rejection as being given the cold\nshoulder, and yet research demonstrates\nthat people do indeed report feeling that\na room is colder after someone has just\nrejected them than after someone has\njust accepted them. 14 And surely people\nare only speaking metaphorically when\nthey refer to the stock market as anxious\nor jittery, and yet describing the market\nas mindful leads stock traders to believe\nthat trends are likely to continue whereas\ndescribing the market as mindless leads\ntraders to predict more random\nvariability. 15 Whether metaphorical or\nliteral, seeing other agents as mindful\nmatters because people tend to treat the\nagent as if it has a mind. That matters\nfor at least three major reasons.\nFirst, mindful agents have both\nintentions and the capacity for selfcontrol.\nMindful agents can therefore be\nheld responsible for their actions.\nPossessing a guilty mind (mens rea) is\nnecessary for being held criminally\nresponsible for a crime in the US, a\nPage | 98\nprecedent found in courts around the\nworld dating back to the Middle Ages.\nIn times past and cultures in which\npeople did not so naturally restrict\nintentional capacities to other humans,\nanimals (such as rats) and objects (such\nas “possessed” statues) were common\ntargets of criminal prosecution 16,17 .\nIncreasing the extent to which other\nagents seem mindful also increases the\npraise or blame that they receive for\ntheir actions. And even diminishing the\nextent to which people feel in mindful\ncontrol of their own behavior (e.g., by\nundermining people’s belief in free will),\nleads people to behave in ways that are\nconsistent with diminished self-control\n(such as by cheating on an exam when\ntempted to do so). 18\nSecond, other minds are capable\nof thinking, and may therefore be\nthinking about you. Being under\nscrutiny by mindful agents has two basic\neffects on human behavior. One is that\nmindful agents become sources of social\ninfluence, increasing the extent to which\npeople behave in socially desirable\nways 20 . Imagine, for instance, how you\nmight behave if you found a magic ring\nthat made you invisible… and you’ll get\nthe point. This ability for mindful\nsurveillance to control behavior has been\nproposed as one of the reasons, if not the\nprimary reason, why religious systems\nthat posit an omnipresent deity are able\nto maintain such large-scale cooperative\nsocieties. The other effect of mindful\nsurveillance is that it is mentally taxing\nto monitor others’ thoughts. This\neffortful monitoring can diminish a\nperson’s performance on other\ncognitively demanding tasks 21 . And\nwhile waiting for a stressful event, such\nas giving a speech, people show less\nstress-related responses when in the\npresence of their relatively mindless pet\nthan when in the presence of their\nrelatively more mindful spouse 22 .\nFinally, other minds matter\nbecause mindful agents become moral\nagents worthy of care and compassion 7 .\nThe principle of autonomy captures this\nmost basic of human rights—that\nbecause all people have the same\nminimal capacity to suffer, deliberate,\nand choose, no person can compromise\nthe body, life, or freedom of another\nperson. Agents with mindful\nexperience, the capacity to suffer,\ndeliberate, and choose, become those\nthat evoke empathy and concern for well\nbeing, whereas agents without mindful\nexperience can be treated simply as\nmindless objects. From debates about\nabortion to animal rights to euthanasia,\nthe mindful experience of the agents in\nquestion is often either the explicit or\nimplicit focus of debate. Making\ninvisible minds visible, and hence more\nlike one’s own, enables people to more\nreadily follow the most famous of all\nethical dictates—to treat others as you\nwould have others treat you.\nConclusion\nIt is impossible for scientists to\nexamine whether God was looking out\nfor the passengers of flight 1549 or\npunishing the residents of New Orleans\nwith Hurricane Katrina, but it is very\npossible to examine why people might\nmake such inferences. These\nexaminations have revealed a\nremarkable capacity to look beyond the\nvisible behavior that the environment\nprovides to reason about a completely\ninvisible world of intentions and goals,\nof motives and beliefs, of attitudes and\npreferences—an invisible world of other\nminds. Understanding when people are\nlikely to recognize other minds (and see\ninto them) and when they are not is the\nPage | 99\nkey to understanding when people may\nbe likely to invoke natural versus\nsupernatural explanations, when gadgets\ncan seem to have minds of their own,\nand when people are likely to treat their\npets as people and their enemies as\nanimals. A mind like our own, with the\ncapacity to see into other minds, is\nessential for an agent to be, as we are,\nfundamentally social.\nReferences\n1.  Epley,  N.,  Waytz,  A., &  Cacioppo,  J.T. (2007). \nOn seeing human: A three–factor theory of \nanthropomorphism.  Psychological  Review, \n114, 864–886. \n2.

But what is the\nfoundation that we use to build such\nconnections? We experience empathy as\na form of emotional resonance and\nunderstanding of other people. This\nconnection allows us to comfort and\nsupport and celebrate with others. Being\nin tune with emotional states of others\nallows us to respond in ways that\nstrengthen a group. But how do we\nunderstand the thoughts and goals of\nothers? How do we predict choices and\ndecisions to facilitate cooperation in\ngroups? Anthropomorphism is the basis\nfor predicting behavior and thoughts and\ngoals. Nick Epley discusses how\nanthropomorphism is rooted in an\negocentric view of others. Moreover our\nview of others is not confined to the\nothers that are people. It is perhaps\nreflective of the deep and fundamental\nnature of anthropomorphism in the\nsocial brain that its anthropomorphic\ninferences about agents can be derived\nfrom observed behavior, allowing us to\nunderstand “minds” where none may\nexist, as in mechanical toys or alarm\nclocks. Of course we tend to understand\nthose minds by thinking they are just\nlike us.\nEven when there is no agent to\nbe seen, events in the world may be\nunderstood by attributing them to unseen\nagents. During World War II, the\nbombing of London was demonstrably\nrandom, but citizens of London could\nnot help but discern intentional patterns\nin the attacks. As Epley points out,\nhurricanes and floods are even today\nattributed to the hand of God, perhaps an\nangry God. Clark Gilpin discusses how\nreligions may use this aspect of the\nsocial brain to achieve an understanding\nof God and what God wants. This kind\nof anthropomorphism can be taken to\ndifferent metaphoric extremes in\npersonifying God as father or friend.\nBut an overly concrete personification\nmay have costs perhaps diminishing the\nuniversality and pervasiveness of God in\nother religions. Thus religions may\ndiffer in theological perspective on the\nvalue of the anthropomorphic impulse\ninherent in the social brain.\nPage | 102\nChapter 11 11\nAnthropomorphism: Human\nConnection to a Universal Society\nWhen Jonathan Edwards, an\nangular New England minister in his late\n11 The lead author, Clark Gilpin, Ph.D., is the\nMargaret E. Burton Professor of the History of\nChristianity at the University of Chicago\nDivinity School. Clark studies the cultural\nhistory of theology in England and America\nfrom the seventeenth century to the present.\nFrom 1990 to 2000, he served as dean of the\nDivinity School, and from 2000 to 2004 he\ndirected the Martin Marty Center, the Divinity\nSchool’s institute for advanced research in all\nfields of the academic study of religion. His\ncurrent research projects include a book with the\nworking title Alone with the Alone: Solitude in\nAmerican Religious and Literary History, which\nexplores ways in which the spiritual discipline of\nsolitary writing—autobiographic narratives,\njournals, and letters—shaped the careers of\nmajor New England intellectuals of the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\nAnthropomorphic representations of\nGod make many modern people very nervous,\nincluding many religious people. Attributing\nhuman-like ideas and emotions to the\ncomprehending powers of the universe not only\nseems out of step with modern science but also a\npresumptuous confinement of the world within\nmerely human needs and capacities. Yet, the\nimpulse to speak anthropomorphically about our\n“ultimate environment” has vigorously persisted\ninto the modern age. Rather than dismissing\nanthropomorphism as an outmoded way of\nthinking, this essay adopts a historical approach\nto rethink why anthropomorphism exhibits this\nperennial capacity to focus the human ethical\nimagination on our relations with and obligations\nto the universe within which we live.\nthirties, mounted the narrow steps into\nthe pulpit on July 8, 1741, the sermon he\nwas about to preach would become one\nof the most famously electrifying\norations in American history, “Sinners in\nthe Hands of an Angry God.” Edwards\npreached this sermon during the massive\ntransatlantic religious revival that gave\nrise to Methodism in England and came\nto be known in the American colonies as\n“the Great Awakening.” This was not\nthe familiar pulpit of his congregation in\nNorthampton, Massachusetts, but rather\nthe church at Enfield, a town that had\ngained notoriety for stubbornly resisting\nthe exhortations of previous preachers of\nspiritual awakening. From his scriptural\ntext—“their foot shall slide in due time”\n(Deut. 32: 35)—Edwards drew the\ndoctrine that “there is nothing that keeps\nwicked men, at any one moment, out of\nhell, but the mere pleasure of God.”\nSinners living here and now, Edwards\ndeclared, were “the objects of that very\nsame anger and wrath of God, that is\nexpressed in the torments of hell,” and\nthat wrath was an annihilating fire that\nalready “burns against them; their\ndamnation does not slumber; the pit is\nprepared; the fire is made ready…to\nreceive them.” In a notorious image,\nEdwards portrayed God dangling the\nsinner’s soul over the fires of hell like a\nspider on a single, slender filament of its\nweb. The sermon achieved stunning\nresults, as recorded in the diary of one of\nthose present, Stephen Williams:\n“before the sermon was done, there was\na great moaning and crying out\nthroughout the whole house—what shall\nI do to be saved; oh, I am going to hell;\noh, what shall I do for a Christ.” The\n“shrieks and cries were piercing and\namazing,” Williams reported, and the\nscene was so tumultuous that Edwards\nhad to stop before finishing his sermon. i\nPage | 103\nAs the classic American example\nof fire-and-brimstone Protestant\npreaching, “Sinners in the Hands of an\nAngry God” depends, for its effect, on\nanthropomorphism: ascribing human\nform and attributes—hands, emotions,\nand purposive agency—to nonhuman\nphenomena. Anthropomorphism has\nbeen a hotly debated feature of religion\nsince classical antiquity. But, in the\nmodern world, religious\nanthropomorphism has become\nespecially controversial, while, at the\nsame time, also becoming a crucial\nconcept in modern theories about the\nvery nature of religion. ii Modern\nobjections to anthropomorphism have\ntaken two major forms. First, traditions\nwithin Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\nhave long opposed the worship of\n“idols,” and regarded anthropomorphism\nas a dangerous assault against genuine\npiety and properly theological\nunderstanding of existence. In the\nmodern period these religious objections\nagainst anthropomorphism have\neventuated not only in sophisticated\nintellectual polemics against\nanthropomorphic concepts of God but\nalso in popular movements of\niconoclasm, which protested against\nanthropomorphic representations of the\ndivine and sometimes physically\ndestroyed anthropomorphic images.\nSecond, the rise and development of\nmodern science has emphasized the\nregularity of the processes that structure\nthe natural world. And even when these\norderly processes were described as\nnatural “laws”—a term with obvious\nanthropomorphic connotations—they\nhave generally been understood in ways\nthat are thoroughly impersonal and\nlacking any intrinsic purpose or design.\nHence, modern science has generated\nnumerous questions about religious\ninterpretations of influence on the course\nof nature by divine ideas and purposes.\nSince the late nineteenth century, many\ninstances of the so-called “warfare”\nbetween science and theology have\nturned on the issue of whether any\nscientific plausibility could be attached\nto concepts of a divine mind, purpose, or\nintention that guided or ordered the\nstructure of the universe. iii According to\nthe philosopher Charles Taylor, the\ntransition from perceptions of a divinely\nordered, purposive universe to an\n“impersonal order” of nature marked a\npivotal change that, especially since the\neighteenth century, has shaped “a secular\nage” among the societies of the modern\nWest. iv In short, anthropomorphism has\nnot only become a source of tension\nwithin religions but also something of an\nimpasse between religious and scientific\ninterpretations of the universe.\nNonetheless, anthropomorphic\nassumptions remain vigorously present\nin many of the modern forms of\ntheology, spiritual practice, and religious\nart, a persistence that suggests the\nstrength of the psychological and social\nfunctions performed by\nanthropomorphic representation.\nIn light of these longstanding\ncontroversies about religious\nanthropomorphism, the graphically\nanthropomorphic, spider-dangling deity\nof Edwards’s sermon would seem to\noffer a good test case for understanding\nhow anthropomorphic religious language\nworks in the modern era. Such an\nunderstanding begins with one of the\ncentral themes of this book, namely, the\npowerful human motivation to establish\nand maintain social connections.\nAnthropomorphism extends this drive\nfor social connection beyond the\nboundaries of human societies by\nattributing human characteristics to\nPage | 104\nnonhuman phenomena. In this way,\nanthropomorphic language incorporates\nhuman society in a web of ethical\nobligations that connect to the natural\nenvironment and, by imaginative\nextension, to the universe as a whole.\nAlthough the drive toward social\nconnection is a general human trait,\nhowever, persons neither seek nor find\nsatisfaction in a generalized sense of\nconnection. Instead, satisfying social\nconnections are sought and experienced\nin terms of the social norms and values\nof particular historical and cultural\nsettings. Likewise, anthropomorphism,\nas an inferred social connection to the\nnonhuman, takes shape and becomes\npersuasive in terms of historically and\nculturally specific assumptions about\nsociety and social relations. This\nchapter will, therefore, step back from\n“Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,”\nin order to describe how contemporary\nscholarship in social neuroscience and in\nthe history of religions provides a fresh\npoint of view on the workings of\nanthropomorphic perception and then\ntest that interpretive model by\nreappraising Edwards’s famous sermon\nin its historical context.\nThe Boundary of the Human\nThe line between the human and\nthe nonhuman is, perhaps, the most\nconsequential presupposition that any\nsociety, group, or individual adopts\nabout life in the world. The way various\ncultures draw this line, between “us” and\n“the other,” has shaped civilizations and\ntheir goals as well as the norms of\npersonal conduct and identity. Although\nconcepts of the human have a long and\ncontentious philosophical history, people\nin their everyday lives show remarkable\nconsensus in the features they use to\ndefine “human.” Central to this process\nof perceiving the human is a perception\nof mind in other agents, including the\npresence of goal-directed agency,\nemotions such as anger, guilt, or pride, a\ncapacity for self-awareness, and free\nwill. As Nick Epley demonstrated in the\npreceding chapter, the perception of\nthese distinctively human traits—“seeing\ninvisible minds”—is a psychological\nmechanism with tremendous influence\non the way humans order and understand\ntheir social environment.\nMind perception is such a\npowerful tool of inductive inference,\nhowever, that it regularly crosses the line\nit has itself drawn between the human\nand the nonhuman. Scholars from a\nwide array of disciplines have long\nobserved humans’ anthropomorphic\ntendency to see nonhuman things or\nevents as humanlike, imbuing the real or\nimagined behavior of nonhuman\nphenomena with human motivations,\nagency, and emotions. By perceiving\nthe world in terms of human capacities\nand social relationships,\nanthropomorphism builds a complex\nsystem of analogies that uses knowledge\nof what it is like to be a person, in order\nto interpret the behavior of animals, the\nfunction of technological devices, the\noperation of complex social systems\nsuch as “the market,” or natural\noccurrences such as violent weather\npatterns or catastrophic events. v Hence,\nanthropomorphism, as a process of\ninference that not only draws but also\ncrosses the line between the human and\nthe nonhuman, has very substantial\nconsequences for the human sense of\nconnection to nonhuman animals, to\nlarger ecological systems, and to the\nstructure of the universe taken as a\nwhole.\nContemporary psychological\nresearch has created an intellectual space\nthat opens the phenomenon of\nPage | 105\nanthropomorphism to fresh possibilities\nfor interpretation that are especially\nimportant for understanding its role in\nthe human spiritual traditions in\nmodernity, as well as the controversies\nsurrounding that role. This research\nproposes that a single set of\npsychological mechanisms is likely to\nexplain when people perceive a mind at\nwork in an encountered phenomenon,\nregardless of whether the thing in\nquestion is a god, a machine, an animal,\nanother person, or an uncanny sequence\nof events. From this perspective, the\npsychological process of\nanthropomorphic inference works in\nconcert with two other motivational\nmechanisms: the need to interact\neffectively with nonhuman phenomena\nin our environment and the desire to\nestablish social connections with other\nhumans. vi The phrase anthropomorphic\ninference fails to capture, however, the\ninteractive dynamism that infuses a\nperson’s perception that a mind is at\nwork in another agent. Put more\nstrongly, our sense that mind is present\nin the other is, in no small measure, the\nsense that we are communicating. The\nabsence of this communicative\ndimension of mind perception is\nprecisely the tragedy in the family of an\nAlzheimer’s patient—the loss of\nreciprocal recognition. As Tanya\nLuhrmann vividly illustrates in the next\nchapter, religious anthropomorphism\nbuilds on the notion that this\ncommunicative reciprocity extends\nbeyond the boundary of human society\ninto the wider environment and includes\nsocial connection and communication\nwith the divine.\nAnthropomorphism adds an\nobvious but important twist to these\npsychological mechanisms: whenever a\nperson ascribes human attributes to a\nnonhuman phenomenon, the person\nnonetheless continues to perceive it as\nnonhuman. When, for instance, a pet\nowner observes a dog’s reliability and\ninfers that this behavior arises from the\ndog’s faithfulness, the owner does not go\non to say that the dog is human. Indeed,\nan indispensable aspect of an\nanthropomorphic way of seeing Fido’s\nfaithfulness is that the person also\ncontinues to see Fido as a dog. This dual\nperception is even more pronounced in a\nparallel illustration: a person observes\nthe everyday reliability of gravity and\ninfers that this arises from faithfulness at\nthe heart of the natural order. Both\nillustrations indicate a close connection\nof anthropomorphism to metaphor, in\nwhich persons understand one kind of\nthing in terms of another by identifying a\nfeature that bridges their difference\nwithout eliminating it. The specific\nfeature, in this case faithfulness, posits a\npoint of comparison that enables a\nfamiliar human capacity for loyalty to\nenable interpretation of another,\nunfamiliar or alien phenomenon. The\nillustrations further suggest that Fido’s\nfaithfulness is what could be called weak\nanthropomorphism, because one could\nplausibly argue that dogs and humans\nactually do share a capacity for\nfaithfulness. We perceive that, as\nmammals, they exhibit many behavioral\nsimilarities. By contrast, the perception\nof faithfulness as an attribute of the\nnatural order is strong\nanthropomorphism, because it makes a\nfar more daring inference in its effort to\ndraw an analogy that produces insight or\nknowledge about the communicative\nreciprocity of the human and the\nnonhuman. Religions, as Edwards’s\nsermon illustrates, build primarily on\nstrong anthropomorphism in order to\npropound communicative social\nPage | 106\nconnection with the nonhuman world.\nThe metaphorical and analogical\nreasoning so characteristic of religious\ninterpretations of the world is not merely\na rhetorical flourish but is, instead,\nclosely tied to general psychological\nprocesses in which self-knowledge and\nknowledge of other humans function as\nthe most readily accessible starting\npoints for inferences we make about\nhuman connections to the most\ncomprehensive and consequential forces\nat work in the nonhuman world. vii\nAnthropomorphism’s dual\nperception of nonhuman phenomena—as\nsimultaneously both like and unlike\nhuman persons—has shaped modern\nreligious and spiritual perceptions in two\nespecially intriguing directions. In one\ncase, it has fastened on the difference\nbetween the human and the divine and\ncultivated iconoclastic perceptions of the\nspiritual in which anthropomorphic\nrepresentation is regarded as a\ndangerously misleading, albeit\nnecessary, accommodation to the\nlimitations of human reason. viii In the\nother case, it has emphasized the point of\nmetaphorical identity between the human\nand the nonhuman. Thus, an ancient\nidea held that the physical universe was\na macrocosm mirroring the human\nmicrocosm, and this included what\nliterary critics have named “the pathetic\nfallacy,” that is, a sympathetic response\nin nature to the affective states of\nhumans. The early modern political\nphilosopher Hugo Grotius (1583-1645),\nfor example, described how human\ndisobedience to divine law prompted an\nanthropomorphic emotional response\nfrom nature: “with sad motion\nwheeling, let the sky lament and\nmourn.” ix In the modern history of\nreligions, these two modes of\nanthropomorphism, one accentuating\ndifference and the other accentuating\nidentity, have varied according to social\ncircumstance, rhetorical purpose, and\npolitical ramifications. “Sinners in the\nHands of an Angry God” illustrates, in\none historical context, how\nanthropomorphic language crosses the\nboundary of the human in order to\ninterpret human ethical responsibility to\nboth the human and the nonhuman\nenvironment.\nThe Rhetoric of Divine Wrath\nClearly, Edwards’s\nanthropomorphic rhetoric destabilized in\na terrifying way the Enfield\ncongregation’s complacent perceptions\nof the world. It did so by starting from\nan assumption that Edwards and the\ncongregation shared: that humanity’s\nultimate environment should be\nconstrued, anthropomorphically, as a\ncosmic society held together by a\ncovenant that God had made with the\nwhole of creation. The sermon induced\nterror among the congregants by\ngraphically portraying their own\nresponsibility for disrupting the\nharmonious order of this allencompassing\nsociety and provoking\ndivine wrath for their rebellion against\nthe covenant.\nThe primary evidence for this\ndivine wrath came not, however, from\nthe external orders of nature and divine\nprovidence, which Edwards imagined\nworking together to maintain the\nharmonious order of the world. Instead,\nwrath had arisen from a clash between\nthe benign will of the world and the\nrebellious human will: “there is laid in\nthe very nature of carnal men a\nfoundation for the torments of hell:\nthere are those corrupt principles, in\nreigning power in them, and in full\npossession of them, that are seeds of hell\nPage | 107\nfire.” For the present God restrained\nhuman wickedness “by his mighty\npower, as he does the raging waves of\nthe troubled sea,” but, if God should\nwithdraw that restraining power,\nhumanity’s willful self-regard would\noverturn nature. The most dangerous\nfire in creation was not, therefore, the\nfire of hell but rather the hellfire bursting\nforth from an unrestrained human will:\n“The corruption of the heart of man is a\nthing that is immoderate and boundless\nin its fury; and while wicked men live\nhere, it is like fire pent up by God’s\nrestraints,” but, should God ever relax\nhis governance, humanity’s boundless\nfury “would set on fire the course of\nnature.”\nThe turmoil stirred by human\nwillfulness, like a violent storm at sea,\nthreatened to capsize the ark of the\nuniverse, and the earth responded to this\nthreat in a terrifying version of the\npathetic fallacy, in which not empathy\nbut enmity arose between humans and\ntheir natural environment.\nConsequently, except for “the sovereign\npleasure of God, the earth would not\nbear you one moment,” and Edwards\nwarned the Enfield congregation that\n“the creation groans with you” and\nresented its subservience to human\nusurpation: “the sun don’t willingly\nshine upon you to give you light to serve\nsin and Satan; the earth don’t willingly\nyield her increase to satisfy your lusts;\nnor is it willingly a stage for your\nwickedness to be acted upon; the air\ndon’t willingly serve you for breath to\nmaintain the flame of life in your vitals,\nwhile you spend your life in the service\nof God’s enemies. God’s creatures are\ngood, and were made for men to serve\nGod with, and do not willingly subserve\nto any other purpose, and groan when\nthey are abused to purposes so directly\ncontrary to their nature and end.” A\nrebellious humanity antagonized the rest\nof creation, “and the world would spew\nyou out, were it not for the sovereign\nhand of him who hath subjected it in\nhope.”\nThe just order of the cosmos\nwould rightly destroy humanity for its\nwillful rebellion against the order of the\nwhole, and the fact that this had not\nalready happened was the expression of\nsomething like the self-restraining mercy\nof a monarch who does not order the\nexecution of a traitor who has offended\nthe royal honor: “The bow of God’s\nwrath is bent, and the arrow made ready\non the string, and Justice bends the\narrow at your heart, and strains the bow,\nand it is nothing but the mere pleasure of\nGod, and that of an angry God, without\nany promise or obligation at all, that\nkeeps the arrow one moment from being\nmade drunk with your blood.”\nThe Great Awakening was\ncoterminous and interactive with the\neighteenth century development of the\nmodern physical sciences, especially\nbuilding on the work of Isaac Newton\n(1642-1727). Edwards’s assumptions\nabout the harmonious order of creation\ncombined the science of his day with the\naristocratic social order of eighteenthcentury\nsociety. In warning the town of\nEnfield that it had transgressed the\ncosmic order, Williams was also\nasserting that it had violated the societal\naspect of that order; as minister, he\ncalled the town to task for both\nviolations.\nConclusion\nEdwards imagined the\nNewtonian universe as an aristocratic\nsocial hierarchy held in harmony by\nsovereign law, at once moral and natural.\nPage | 108\nIn this hierarchy one member—the\nhuman—had stepped beyond its\nassigned place in the cosmic society and\nnow lived in an unwitting complacency,\nignoring the precarious finitude of a life\nbeing pursued by a radical judgment:\n“’tis nothing but [God’s] hand that holds\nyou from falling into the fire every\nmoment: ’tis to be ascribed to nothing\nelse, that you did not go to hell the last\nnight; that you was suffered to awake\nagain in this world, after you closed your\neyes to sleep: And there is no other\nreason to be given, why you have not\ndropped into hell since you arose in the\nmorning, but that God’s hand has held\nyou up.”\nLike his contemporaries, the\ndeists and religiously inclined scientists\nsuch as Newton himself, Jonathan\nEdwards assumed the “Newtonian world\nmachine,” operating with the\nmetronomic regularity of natural law.\nPresupposing both the science and the\naristocratic social hierarchy of his day,\nEdward introduced anthropomorphic\nlanguage to create a clash between this\nharmonious order and the willful selfinterest\nof humans who dared to ignore\ntheir proper rung on the ladder of\nexistence. As a preacher of penitence,\nhe carried his anthropomorphic imagery\nto extravagant heights in order to induce\na reversal of behavior in a recalcitrant\ntown. The sermon effectively threatened\nthe people of Enfield with what\namounted to “metaphysical ostracism,”\nan expulsion no less thoroughgoing than\nthe primordial ejection of Adam and Eve\nfrom the garden. The palpable effect of\nthis imagery depended on the evocation\nof the natural and social orders rising up\nlike, and yet unlike, an angry monarch to\ncrush rebels against the cosmic\ncommonwealth.\nReferences\n1 In the interests of clarity, I have\nslightly rearranged and modernized this\nquotation.

Writing from this perspective,\nhe argued that the universe is a cosmic\nsociety organized under the leadership of\na King of kings, a society against which\nhumans have rebelled and, as a\nconsequence, humans are at risk of\nannihilation except for the mercy of the\nKing. Judgment day will come,\naccording to Edwards, and those who\nhave failed to meet their moral\nresponsibility to the directive of the\nuniverse face eternal isolation. Clark\nGilpin notes that by conjuring up a\npersonified God – a God with emotions,\nintentions, and the capacity to act –\nEdwards instilled great fear and\ntrembling in his listeners that\npresumably motivated them to change\ntheir behaviors in the desired direction.\nIt is hard to imagine that Edwards would\nhave had comparable success had he\nresorted to simple instructions or\nexhortations to engage in certain\nbehaviors and avoid others. The innate\ntendency of people to understand divine\nentities in terms of what people do\nunderstand, namely their own thoughts,\nfeelings, and beliefs, provided the\nleverage on which Edwards relied to\ndrive his message home.\nTanya Luhrmann also discusses a\npersonalized construction of God – a\nGod with whom one can consult and\nwho intervenes in one’s daily life.\nPeople are intrinsically motivated to\nform social connections, and very little\nin life is more rewarding to people than\ntheir social relationships. Luhrmann,\nwho adopts the perspective of a\nparticipant observer, finds that a new\nevangelical Protestant movement, the\nVineyard Church, appeals to this\nmotivation to depict God as one’s\npersonal guide and friend, well within\none’s sensory reach. By conjuring up an\nanthropomorphic God with loving\nemotions, intentions, and actions, the\nVineyard Church creates a desire for a\npersonal relationship with God. But\ndeveloping a relationship with an\ninvisible God defies rationality. People\nmust learn how to transform an abstract\nconcept of an invisible God into a\nconcrete sensory presence in their lives.\nJust as the social brain can perceive\nnonhuman objects as human, the social\nbrain is also capable of selectively\nattending to sensory experiences and\ninterpreting these sensations as God’s\npresence.\nPage | 111\nChapter 12 12\nHow Does God Become Real\nHow does God become real to\npeople when God is understood to be\n12 The lead author is Tanya Luhrmann, Ph.D., a\nprofessor in the Stanford Anthropology\nDepartment.

This essay\nsuggests that it may be more helpful, and more\naccurate, to understand religious commitment as\na response to sensory experience that can be\nlearned, and that the capacity to learn depends\nupon one’s knowledge and belief, one’s\nproclivity for experiencing the world in\nparticular ways, and the impact of devotional\npractice.\ninvisible and immaterial, as God is\nwithin the Christian tradition? This is not\nthe question of whether God is real, but\nrather how people learn to make the\njudgment that God is present. Such a\nGod is not accessible to the senses.\nWhen you talk to that God, you can\nneither see his face nor hear his voice.\nYou cannot touch him. How can you be\nconfident that he is there?\nAnthropology cannot answer the\nquestion of whether God is real. But the\ntraditional method of the discipline,\nparticipant observation, can use the\nslow, careful method of fieldwork to\nexplore the way that people learn to\nexperience God as present in their lives.\nAnd what the method can teach us is that\nthis often intensely private and personal\nrelationship between a creature and its\ncreator is built through a profoundly\nsocial process.\nIn fact, one of anthropology’s\nmost useful contributions to\nunderstanding the experience of God is\nto draw attention to just how much work\nfaith takes, and to the fact that different\nkinds of faith—and different\nunderstandings of God—demand\ndifferent kinds of work. Many who do\nnot believe in God approach the question\nof religious belief as the problem of why\npeople should believe in the existence of\nan invisible, intentional agent in their\nworld. One of the more persuasive\nrecent answers emerges from the\nobservation that many of our cognitive\ntraits evolved to help us survive.\nEvolutionary anthropologists and\npsychologists argue that belief in\ninvisible beings is an accidental\nbyproduct of the way our minds have\nevolved over the millennia. Our quick,\neffortless, automatic intuitions lead us to\n“anthropomorphize,” or to see faces in\nthe clouds, as one scholar puts it. From\nPage | 112\nthis perspective, people believe in God\nbecause it is so easy to believe in\ninvisible supernatural presence, and the\ngreat religions are elaborations around\nthis basic core. 1\nBelief in the Invisible\nYet it is also true that in many\nways it is hard for people to believe in\nthe invisible, intentional being of God, at\nleast in some ways and at some times. It\nis one thing to believe in the abstract that\nthere is a good and loving God; it is\nanother thing to believe that this God\nloves you in particular this very\nafternoon when your car has broken\ndown in the rain. Many Christians\nstruggle at some point with whether God\nexists or with whether they understand\nGod’s nature. A young man may come\nto university as a devout Christian, take\na course on religion, and begin to\nwonder whether Christ as well as\nKrishna are cultural constructions. A\ndepressed woman may understand\nherself as devout, but find that when she\nsits down to pray she feels that no one is\nlistening to her prayers. And always\nthere are times when terrible things\nhappen to good and faithful people who\noften continued to believe in God in the\nabstract, but who find that they can not\nlonger pray at all. The struggle between\nespoused religion (the religion one\nasserts; the Nicene creed) and lived\nreligion (the way in which one\nexperiences God from moment to\nmoment) is central to the life of the\nChristian, and perhaps to the lives of\nmost believers.\nThe problem for believers is that\nto experience the Christian God as\npresent, one must override three basic\nfeatures of human psychology, features\nthat are also part of our evolutionary\ninheritance. A person must override the\nexpectation that our minds are private,\nan expectation so substantial that\nresearchers have shown that it develops\naround the world at a more or less\nsimilar age and can be found even in\nnon-human primates. A person must\noverride the expectation that persons are\nvisible. And finally, a person must\noverride the expectation that love is\nconditional, as it is for all social beings\nbeyond a certain age, when right\nbehavior is expected as a condition of\nhuman interaction. At least, some\nversions of Christianity expect\nunconditional love.\nThe deep puzzle of faith is not\nwhy but how. How is it possible that\npeople are able to violate such\nfundamental expectations of presence?\nThe answer, in part, is that they do not.\nFor most Christians, it will be a lifelong\nprocess to believe in all times and in all\nways that their God is real for them in\nthe way that their church tells them that\nGod is real. As the psalmist laments:\n“how long wilt thou forget me, Oh Lord?\nFor ever? How long wilt thou hide thy\nface from me?” (Psalm 13: 1). What they\ndo to make God plausible for them\ndepends upon their understanding of\nGod and on what the social world of a\nfaith teaches about how to experience\ntheir minds and bodies to find evidence\nfor God’s presence.\nLearning to Sense the Presence of God\nIn 2004 I set out to study\nethnographically the way God becomes\nreal for people in a church that would\nexacerbate the cognitive burden of\nbelief. I chose an example of the new\nProtestant church that grew up after the\n1960s. 2 Those churches set out as an\ninvitation to experience God as\nconcretely and as vividly as God had\nbeen experienced by the earliest\nPage | 113\nChristian disciples. This God is both\nintensely human and intensely\nsupernatural. In these churches, God is\nunderstood as so person-like that he\nbecomes someone to joke and argue\nwith, someone one chats to when\nwalking down the street, about the little\ntrivial things that matter only to the\ncongregant. Coming to know God in\nsuch a church is described as to hear\nGod “speak.” Dallas Willard, a beloved\nevangelical’s intellectual, puts it baldly:\nthat God’s face-to-face conversations\nwith Moses are the “normal human life\nGod intended for us.” I conducted\nethnographic fieldwork at a church that\nexemplifies this approach to God, a\nVineyard Christian Fellowship in\nChicago and then on the San Francisco\npeninsula (there were eight such\nchurches in Chicago and four on the\npeninsula). For three years I went to\nSunday morning gatherings. I joined\nthree small groups, or housegroups, each\nfor a year; I went to conferences and\nretreats; and I interviewed many\ncongregants casually and also more\nformally about the way they experienced\nGod.\nOverall, what I observed was that\nthe process of coming to know God in\nsuch a church could best be described as\na mapping process in which the\ncongregants learn to use the familiar\nexperience of their own minds and\nbodies to give content to the abstract\nexperience of God. This is the way that\nhumans learn most commonplace\nabstract words, in effect cognitively\nmapping from what we know to what we\ncan only imagine. God speaks: so\ncongregants learn to infer from their own\nexperience of inner speech the way in\nwhich God talks to them. God relates: so\ncongregants learn to imagine a\nrelationship with God based on their\nown experience of relationship. And\nGod loves: and congregants use their\nown experience of being loved by a\nhuman as an example of the way they\nare loved by God. But unlike learning\nabout time, congregants also map back.\nThey build up a model of God by\ninterpreting out of their own familiar\nexperience into a representation shaped\nby the social world of the church and the\nnarrative of the sacred text, and then\nthey seek to re-map their own interior\nemotional experience by matching it to\nthis representation. This demands\nconstant effort, continual work on the\nway one pays attention and interprets\none’s experience. As an ethnographer, I\ncould see three kinds of work.\nFirst, God must be recognized as\npresent. What congregants learn to do is\nto cherry-pick mental events out of the\neveryday flow of their awareness, and to\nidentify that moment as other than\nthemselves, as being of God. God was\nsaid to speak in several different ways.\nHe spoke through the Bible, so that a\nverse “jumped out” at a congregant, or in\nsome way drew their attention. For\nexample:\n“I was reading in [some book] and I\ndon’t even know why I was reading it.\nThere’s a part where God talks about\nraising up elders in the church to pray\nfor the church. And I remember, it just\nstuck in my head and I knew that the\nverse was really important and that it\nwas applicable to me. I didn’t know\nwhy. It was one of those, let me put it in\nmy pocket and figure it out later.” How\ndid she know that it was important?\n“Because I just felt it. I just felt like it\nreally spoke to me. I don’t really know\nwhy. And a couple of days later a friend\nasked me to be on the prayer team and it\nwas like, wow, that’s what it was.”\nPage | 114\nGod spoke also through circumstances.\nWhat a skeptic might interpret as\ncoincidence is understood as God’s\nintentional decision to direct the\ncongregant’s attention. For example:\n“Everything in my life right now is\nfocused on trying to get to England, and\nI needed to get some ID pictures. So I\nwas really anxious—the money hasn’t\nreally come together—and one afternoon\nI just felt like God said, you need to get\nup and go get those. Go get those ID\npictures that you need. I was like, that’s\ntotally inefficient. I don’t have a car, so\nit’s like walking half an hour to\nWalgreens and another half an hour\nback. Like, I could do this later and\ncombine it with several things I need to\nget done. But I felt it was a step of faith\nto do this thing. So I did it—grumbling.\nThen on the way there and back I ran\ninto three people I knew, and I felt that\nthere was a kind of pattern, and that I\nwas in the right place at the right time.”\nThese ways of recognizing God are\nwidely shared in many forms of\nChristianity. More specific to\nexperiential evangelical Christianity is\nthe expectation that God will speak\ndirectly into the mind, by placing a\nmental image or thought or sensation\nthere. For example:\n“I’m praying for someone and, you\nknow, they say their situation, what they\nwant me to pray for. I start praying and\nstart trying to, you know, really\nexperience God, and, you know, I see\nthese vivid images, and I’m explaining\nthese vivid images and what I think they\nmean and, you know, sort of checking in\nwith the person, you know, does this\nresonate with you? They’re like “oh, my\ngosh, yes! How did you know that?”\nMost congregants find this process of\npulling out specific thoughts and\nascribing them to God baffling at first:\nagain, the process violates the basic\nhuman experience that the mind is\nprivate. A congregant commented: “now\nI know that the ‘something’ is God,\nGod’s voice. But I didn’t at all have\nwords to describe it at that time I didn’t\nunderstand. It was very confusing.”\nThe social world of the church\ntaught specific ways to differentiate\nbetween mental events that are God and\nthat are not. This technique has been\ntaught in the church since the earliest\ntime as “discernment,” although the\ncontent of the word and its rules has\nvaried with the era. In the modern\nexperiential evangelical church, the rules\nof discernment are more often taught by\nexample and gossip than explicitly.\nNevertheless, there appeared to be four\nprinciples. A thought might be said to\ncome from God if: the thought was\nunexpected; the thought was consonant\nwith God’s nature; the congregant had\nadditional confirmation (one “tested” the\nthought); and one felt peace during the\nexperience. The process was understood\nto be ambiguous, and left room not only\nfor the congregant to be wrong, but for\ndifferent congregants to disagree about\nwhether God had, in fact, spoken in a\nparticular manner. One afternoon, a\nwoman spoke in front of the church\nexplaining that God had spoken to her\nand told her that she should carry out\nsome mission work in a lovely part of\nMexico. The man sitting next to me said\ndrily, “God sure wants a lot of\nevangelizing in Puerto Vallarta.”\nPage | 115\nSecond, God must be\nexperienced in relationship. Such\nchurches invite congregants to\nexperience God in their imaginations as\na person. Again, this violates a basic\npsychological expectation: persons have\nfaces to observe and hands to shake.\nHuman relational interactions are based\non sensorial response. Churches like the\nVineyard explicitly suggest that one\nshould imagine a sensorial response\nfrom God and encouraged congregants\nto participate in a kind of let’s pretend\nplay in which God was present. The\npastor suggested one Sunday morning\nthat congregants should put out a second\ncup of coffee for God, and sit down with\nhim to chat. People went on “date night”\nwith God. They would get a sandwich,\nand sit down on park bench to talk with\nGod as they imagined his arm around\ntheir shoulders. They would ask God\ntruly trivial questions like what shirt they\nshould wear in the morning and what\nmovie he thought they would like. These\nbehaviors were clearly play-like. One\ncongregant remarked: “I definitely do\nthat. When I can’t decide what to wear.\nLike, God, what should I wear?” Then\nshe laughed. “And you know, then I kind\nof forget about the fact that I asked God.\nI think God cares about really, really\nlittle things in my life. I mean I know\nGod cares, but I don’t expect him to tell\nme what to wear. I’m like, Oh, I think\nI’ll wear that and forget I even asked\nGod!” This invitation to play was C.S.\nLewis’ explicit contribution to twentieth\ncentury Christianity: “let us pretend to\nturn the pretense into a reality.” In\nchurches which encourage such play,\nheresy fades in importance. The pastors\nand the committed congregants worry\nabout “deadness,” not flawed imagining.\nThird, congregants must learn to\nrespond emotionally to God as if God is\nreal. If God is real, a Christian (at least,\nthe modern evangelical Christian) should\nexperience the emotions that one would\nfeel if one were loved unconditionally.\nMost do not. It is, in fact, difficult for\nhumans to experience themselves as\nunconditionally loved because no matter\nhow warm and loving a parent may be,\nat some point the child is expected to\ncontrol his or her behavior and parental\nlove will becomes contingent. The task\nof feeling unconditionally loved imposes\nupon the congregant not only the burden\nof identifying and relating to an invisible\nbeing, but experiencing emotions in\nresponse to that being’s love which the\ncongregant rarely, if ever, truly\nexperiences. Congregants talk about the\nexperience of unconditional love as rare:\nthey speak of “those moments” when\none really feels God’s love.\nI was driving home from grocery\nshopping in the car and I stopped at a\nlight and suddenly for no reason that I\ncould come up with, I was weeping and I\nfelt a massive and awesome sense of the\npresence of God in the car with me. It\njust came and I had absolutely no control\nover it. I pulled over to the side of the\nroad—I remember thinking that I was so\nin love with Jesus at that moment that no\none else on the planet could come close.\nAfter about twenty minutes of real\nintensity the feeling subsided somewhat,\nbut the presence of Jesus stayed with me.\nI drove home not really ever able to fully\nexpress what happened without sounding\nlike I’d taken something illegal.\nThe more immediate aim seemed to be\nto experience what Galatians 5:22-23\ncalls the “fruits of the spirit”: love, joy,\npeace, patience and so forth. The social\nlife of the church was rich in emotional\npractices which sought to reshape the\nPage | 116\ncongregants’ interior emotional world by\nmodeling the self on God, or on the self\nas seen from God’s loving perspective.\nOne of the most important was prayer\nministry, where the person for whom the\nprayer is given is often crying and in\nvisible pain; those around the person are\noffering prayers which describe the ways\nin which the sobbing person is loved by\nGod. Another was treating prayer like a\npsychotherapy session. One congregant\nexplained: “It’s just like talking to a\ntherapist, especially in the beginning\nwhen you’re revealing things that are\ndeep in your heart and deep in your soul,\nthe things that have been pushed down\nand denied.” In these churches which\nemphasize God’s love and intimacy, hell\nand fear largely disappear.\nThe central demand of these\nlearning practices is to use one’s own\nmental experience as evidence and\ncontent for the responsive presence of\nthis God, who is believed to be other\nthan oneself, and to use pretend play to\nintegrate those mental events into a\nrepresentation that is persuasively\nexternal to the self. The emotional\npractices provide both direct evidence of\nGod’s love and, more generally,\nevidence that participation in church is\nsatisfying and worthwhile. In effect the\nprocess asks the congregants to carve\nGod out of their own experience and to\nexperience those phenomena as other;\nand it uses the emotional practices taught\nby the church and the social world of the\ncongregation to help them hold that God\nseparate and apart and lovingly\nresponsive.\nThis is hard work to do, and not\neveryone was able to do it, or to do it\neasily. Here two congregants describe\ntheir difficulty in experiencing God\ndirectly despite their efforts.\nJake: “I remember desperately wanting\nto draw closer to God, and [to have] one\nof these inspired Holy Spirit moments …\nI wanted those [experiences] and I\nsought them out, but I never found\nmyself encountering them”\nIrene: “I don’t understand the gift of\nprophecy completely. I’ll probably\nnever will and I don’t have it and I don’t\nwant it because it would scare me.”\nHere is another congregant who has been\nable to do so:\nNora: “It was pretty early on in my\nrelationship with him. I was just all full\nof myself one morning. I just had\nwonderful devotions and worships and\njust felt so close. I went out, and it was\nthe most god-awful day. It was icy rain\nand gray and cold and it was sleeting.\nI’m just full of the joy of the Lord, and I\nsay, “God, I praise you that it isn’t\nsnowing, and that nothing’s\naccumulating, and that the streets aren’t\nicy”—and then I went around the corner,\nand I hit a patch of ice, and just about\nwent down. It was so funny to me. I just\nburst out laughing out loud. It was just\nso funny that he would put me in my\nplace in such a slapstick personal kind of\nway. But then he just graced me the rest\nof the morning. The bus showed up right\naway, which it never does. I was\nreading, and I missed my stop to get off,\nand I heard God say, “Get off the bus.” I\nlooked up and hollered, and the bus\nactually stopped, half a block on, to let\nme get off. I just felt that intimacy all\nmorning. Like when you go from\nholding a new boyfriend’s hand to\nkissing him goodnight ….”\nPage | 117\nSome people experience God speaking\ndirectly to them in an easy relationship.\nOthers do not.\nAs a result of my involvement\nwith the Templeton group, I decided to\ncarry out some quantitative and\nexperimental work to see whether we\ncould figure out the differences between\nthose who found it easy to do this work,\nand those for whom it was difficult. That\nwork suggests that there is a\npsychological capacity that makes the\nprocess of knowing this kind of God\neasier, though its absence does not\nprevent religious experience, and its\npresence does not predict it. It is the\ncapacity for absorption, which is at the\nheart of imagination. Absorption is the\ncapacity to focus one’s attention on a\nnon-instrumental (and often internal)\nobject while disattending to everyday\nexterior surrounds. Absorption is related\nto hypnosis and dissociation, but not\nidentical to either. All of us go into light\nabsorption states when we settle into a\nbook and let the story carry us away.\nThere are no known physiological\nmarkers of an absorption state, but as the\nabsorption grows deeper, the person\nbecomes more difficult to distract, and\nhis sense of time and agency begins to\nshift. He lives within his imagination\nmore, whether that be simple\nmindfulness or elaborate fantasy, and he\nfeels that the experience happens to him,\nthat he is a bystander to his own\nawareness, more himself than ever\nbefore, or perhaps absent, but in any\ncase different. And as the absorption\ngrows deeper, people often experience\nmore imagery and more sensory\nphenomena, sometimes with\nhallucinatory vividness. Scholars do not\ndiscuss training in absorption, although\nresearchers of hypnosis and dissociation\nare clear that some kind of practice\neffects can be seen. 3\nConclusion\nPrayer is basically training in\nabsorption, at least the kind of prayer in\nwhich the person praying focuses\ninwardly and disattends to the everyday\nworld in order to engage with God. It\nwould be hard to over-estimate the\nimportance placed on prayer and prayer\nexperience in a church like this and\nindeed, in Christian America today.\nMany of the best-selling Christian books\nare books on prayer technique, and they\nsell in the millions. Such books often\nbegin by presenting the concrete sensory\nexperience of God described in the\nHebrew Bible as the everyday\nrelationship for which the ordinary\nbeliever should strive. In these manuals,\nthe act of praying is understood as a skill\nthat has to be deliberately learned. I\ndiscovered that these evangelical\ncongregants assumed that prayer was a\nskill which had to be taught, that it was\nhard, that not everyone was good at it,\nand that those who were naturally good\nand well trained would experience\nchanges associated with a more richly\ndeveloped inner world. Their mental\nimages would seem sharper; they would\nbe more likely to report unusual sensory\nexperiences. They would be more able,\nin short, to experience God. The more\nquantitative work—done in\ncollaboration with Howard Nusbaum\nand Ron Thisted--suggests that those\nwho have a proclivity for absorption and\nwho trained that proclivity through\nprayer are indeed more able to\naccomplish the demanding learning that\nthis concept of God sets out. 4 They are\nmore able to identify God’s presence in\ntheir mind. They are more likely to\nexperience God as an invisible\nPage | 118\ncompanion. They may be more capable\nof responding to God emotionally.\nAll theologies have trade-offs.\nThis one offers an intensely personal and\nperson-like God. He can comfort, like a\nfriend, and respond directly, like a\nfriend. He can be like a real social\nrelationship for those who make the\neffort to experience him in this way. But\nbecause that social relationship lacks so\nmany features of actual human\nsociality—no visible body, no\nresponsive face, no spoken voice—such\na theology demands a great deal of effort\nfrom those who follow it. They must\nconstantly work with their attention,\nreinterpreting the ordinary and natural\ninto the presence of the extra-ordinary\nand super-natural. Faiths which manage\nGod differently—less personal, more\npresent in the everyday natural world—\nmake fewer demands on their followers’\nattentional habits. But it may be,\nperhaps, that such a God may be easier\nto take for granted. Paradoxically, it may\nbe that this high-maintenance, effortful\nGod appeals to so many modern people\n(as many as a quarter of all Americans,\naccording to a recent Pew study)\nprecisely because the work demanded\nmakes the God feel more real in a world\nin which disbelief is such a real social\noption.\nReferences\n1\nScholars who contribute to this\nperspective include Scott Atran, Justin\nBarrett, Pascal Boyer, Stewart Guthrie,\nand Harvey Whitehouse.\n2\nThese churches have been described by\nMiller, D. 1997.

However, as Gary\nBerntson and Louise Hawkley have\ndiscussed, beliefs can affect our health\neven to the extent of determining life\nand death. As Tanya Luhrmann\ndiscusses, in some forms of Christianity,\nthere is a real belief in the presence of\nGod. This is not simply a belief of God\nin the world, but a belief of a God who is\nby one’s side. The idea of God as a\nfriend and companion clearly motivates\nthe desire to make such a presence\nmanifest in tangible ways. For some, it is\nthe sense of God with which they\ncommune, for others it is what they\nbelieve to be a sensory experience of\nGod that they seek. Luhrmann outlines\nhow this belief, coupled with a\nsupportive social structure, can lead to\npowerful personal experiences, such as\nhearing the voice of God, reflecting the\noperation of our social brains.\nOur sense of social connection is\nnot dependent on a single set of religious\nbeliefs, however. In human social\nconnections, we can form individual\nrelationships with a spouse or friends\nbut, as John Cacioppo outlined, there are\nother kinds of connections that our social\nbrain seeks, as well. We seek\nconnections with emergent structures\nsuch as groups, clubs, teams,\ncongregations, and beyond. Kathryn\nTanner argues that the belief that God\ncreated the world and bears causal\nresponsibility for it serves to connect\nbelievers to life in a broader way than is\nprovided through individual\nrelationships. This broader connection to\nlife does not depend on the manifestation\nof a presence to whom we can talk\nbecause the evidence of social\nconnection is apparent in the very fabric\nof daily existence. Thus, whereas\nLuhrmann discusses God as a palpable\nfriend that one can learn to attend to and\nexperience as an active presence in one’s\nlife, Tanner discusses God as the\ninitiator of life and the very fabric of\nexistence, a presence so ubiquitous that\nthere is no specific point on which one\ncan focus to attend to or experience God.\nPage | 120\nChapter 13 13\nTheological Perspectives on God as an\nInvisible Force\nAn individual’s beliefs about\nGod are one factor to be included in a\nmulti-dimensional investigation of the\nsocial consequences and possible health\nbenefits of religion, an aid in particular\n13 The lead author is Kathryn Tanner, Ph.D., the\nDorothy Grant Maclear Professor of Theology at\nthe University of Chicago Divinity School. Her\nresearch relates the history of Christian thought\nto areas of contemporary theological concern\nusing critical, social, and feminist theory, with a\nspecial focus on the possible practical\nimplications of Christian beliefs and symbols.\nShe has lectured widely throughout the United\nStates and Europe, and is the author of six books:\nGod and Creation in Christian Theology:\nTyranny or Empowerment? (1988, Blackwell);\nThe Politics of God (1992, Fortress); Theories of\nCulture: A New Agenda for Theology (1997,\nFortress); Jesus, Humanity and the Trinity (2001,\nContinuum and Fortress Press); Economy of\nGrace (2005, Fortress); and Christ the Key\n(2010, Cambridge).\nChristian beliefs are not just theoretical\nmatters, involving putative truth claims about the\nnature of ultimate reality, but practical ones:\nChristian beliefs are often promulgated with the\nhope of impacting the way human beings live, by\nestablishing, for example, the meaningfulness of\nand motivations for certain forms of social\nbehavior. Prior research has concerned the\npossible economic, social and political\nconsequences of Christian beliefs about God's\nrelation to the world. This essay extends such\nquestioning to the topic of perceived social\nisolation. How might belief in God as an\ninvisible force in everyday life affect an\nindividual's sense of social connection?\nto scientific hypothesis generation. x\nScientists can better test for the social\nand health consequences of religious\ncommitment when they know more\nabout the character and range of beliefs\nabout God that such commitment brings.\nThis chapter hopes to show, in\nparticular, that exactly what Christians\nbelieve about the nature of God’s\ninfluence on their lives is likely to have\nan important bearing on one of the\nquestions of this volume: How can\nreligion encourage a sense of connection\nto others, especially in situations of\nperceived social isolation, and thereby\nassuage the adverse health consequences\nof loneliness?\nDepending on what they think\nGod is like, Christians vary in the way\nthey expect God to be a present\ninfluence on their daily lives. God’s\nnature is supernatural or transcendent,\nwhich means God is not very much like\nany of the ordinary persons or things\nwith which they come into regular\ncontact. Christians use the same terms\nfor God that they use for talking about\nordinary persons and things but they\ntherefore know that neither set of terms\nis really adequate to capture who or what\nGod is. On the one hand, God is\nsomething like a human being in that\nGod loves them and wants to do them\ngood, and in that God is unhappy with\ntheir failings and trying, through the use\nof carrots and sticks, to get them to\nchange. But, on the other hand, God is\nreally not very much like an ordinary\nhuman being in that God is present at all\ntimes and everywhere, working\ninexorably to bring about what God\nintends throughout the entirety of\npeoples’ lives by way of influences of\nboth personal and impersonal sorts--for\nexample, through personal words of\nadvice and warning found in the Bible as\nPage | 121\nwell as apparent accidents of fortune like\ncar crashes and the weather. Though\nretaining personal characteristics such as\nlove or anger, God operates less like an\nindividual human person with limited\nreach and partial interests, and more like\nlight, air or gravity do—quite\npervasively and constantly.\nUsually one side or the other\ncomes to the fore in the way Christians\nfeel connected to God: for some\nChristians the personal side of God is\ncentral; for others, the more impersonal.\nThus, some Christians expect God to be\nvery much like a human friend, offering\ncompanionship and good advice. xi As\nTanya Luhrmann explores in her essay,\ntheir religious lives often revolve around\nthe internal sensory or imaginative\nexperiences that make a God of that sort\nseem real to them--the sense that God is\nin the room with them, that God speaks\nto them, and so on. They work to\ncultivate a prayer life that heightens the\nvividness of those experiences and\nthereby allays doubts about the actual\nexistence of this invisible, otherwise\nseemingly unreal, divine friend. In short,\ngood practitioners of prayer gain a\nstronger and more reliable sense that\nGod is present as a friend directing the\ncourse of their lives.\nOther Christians have\nexpectations of a more overarching and\nimpersonal sort about the way God is a\nforce in their lives; these expectations, I\nsuggest below, are the consequence of\ntheir holding certain beliefs about God\nas the creator, sustainer, and savior of\nthe world. In this case a strong sense of\nGod’s presence in one’s life does not\ndepend on having experiences of a\nliterally personal sort or on developing\nthe spiritual practices that help cultivate\nsuch experiences. The sense that God is\npresent as an influence on one’s life is\nrather something one feels all the time\nsimply in virtue of the beliefs one holds\nabout God and the world. Given a\nparticular construal of those beliefs—a\nrelatively impersonal one, I argue—\nsimply having those beliefs in mind,\nwith some awareness of their quite\nobvious presuppositions and\nimplications, makes clear one is never\nalone, never a self-sufficient operator. In\ncontrast to the understanding of God as\nfriend, here God’s invisibility does not\nthreaten to interrupt a sense of God’s\npresence and influence. God’s\ninvisibility to the contrary enables the\nsense of God’s presence and influence to\nbe the routine backdrop of all one’s\nexperience, to constitute a general\noutlook on the world, no matter what the\ncircumstances.\nBelief in Creation as a Backdrop to\nthe Whole of Life\nFor example, a common\nChristian construal of the belief that God\nis the creator of the world makes it\npossible for the sense that God is with\none—one’s supporter and sustainer—to\nbe a constant feature of one’s life as a\nwhole. Contrary to first impressions,\nGod’s creation of the world need not\nrefer to the origin of the universe, or to\nthe beginning of its more specific\nfeatures or components. Were either to\nbe its meaning, belief in God as the\ncreator of the world could not be a very\ncentral component of a generally\napplicable Christian outlook, of much\nrelevance, that is, for more than the\noccasional speculation about origins:\ne.g., why am I here at all? The belief\nconcerns instead a causal dependence\nupon God of a more continuous sort,\nspanning, in short, the whole time of the\nuniverse’s existence and therefore the\nwhole time of one’s individual life. To\nbe created by God is to exist in a relation\nPage | 122\nof dependence upon God for what one is,\nHowever, long one exists. xii A human\nbeing therefore depends upon God for\nmore than the fact of his or her birth: he\nor she remains dependent upon God in\nthe same way ever after. God’s creation\nof the world in general is simply not\ntemporally indexed; it is no more closely\nassociated with the beginning of things\nthan with what comes later. A\npreoccupation with temporal origins\ntherefore commonly drops out of\nChristian accounts of creation: the world\nis just as dependent upon God for its\nexistence whether it has a beginning or\nalways exists. xiii Belief in God’s creation\nof the world for these reasons blurs into\nbelief in God’s supportive maintenance\nof it at every point in time.\nAlso enabling belief in God as\ncreator to form a general backdrop to all\none’s experience—to be relevant on\nevery occasion as a universally\napplicable worldview--is the fact that\nGod is thought to be responsible as\ncreator for the whole of what happens in\nthe world at any one time. To believe\nthat God is the creator of the world is at\nthe very least to believe that God holds\ninto existence the entirety of the world in\nany and all respects in which it is good.\nIn the case of one’s own life, therefore,\nevery aspect of value at every moment—\none’s existence, fine qualities and\ncapacities, enjoyments and\nachievements, beneficial connections\nwith natural and social environments,\nand so on—is to be attributed to God’s\nagency as creator. While there is a good\ndeal of disagreement within Christianity\non this matter, Christians, moreover, not\nuncommonly affirm that God is equally\nbehind the bad things that happen, at\nleast insofar as those bad things can be\nturned to good account--for example,\nharm suffered turned into a salutary\npedagogical correction, just punishment\nfor sin, the necessary testing of one’s\nfaith, or simply a beneficial form of\nsympathy with God’s own suffering on\nthe cross. For both the general reasons\njust mentioned—because of its holism\nand temporal inclusiveness--belief in\nGod as the creator of the world\nencourages love, gratitude, and trust\ntoward God, and toward the world that\nGod brings about, as constant Christian\ndispositions, basic Christian attitudes of\nwide-ranging applicability, whatever\nmight be going on in one’s life.\nSocial Connectedness and Invisibility\nThe same all-inclusive causal\ndependence upon God at all times is\nwhat ensures individuals are never left\non their own, never abandoned to their\nown devices. Christian theologians\n(especially in the Protestant tradition)\nusually develop the psychological\nimplications of this in terms of avoiding\neither anxious or arrogant selfconcern.\nxiv According to this theology,\none does not believe he or she ever\noperates independently of God.\nTherefore, one should never attribute\nsuccesses and achievements in a prideful\nway to oneself, but rather one should\nalways give the glory to God as their\nultimate source. For the same reason,\none should never despair of failings, as if\none’s own inadequacies were the last\nword; one believes a supremely\npowerful and loving influence, God,\nremains an operative force in one’s life,\nHowever, desperate the situation\notherwise appears to be from the\nstandpoint of one’s own powers and\ncapacities to improve one’s lot in life.\nBy discouraging isolated selfregard\nor self-understanding generally,\nthe same nexus of Christian ideas about\nGod as creator has clear consequences\nPage | 123\nfor loneliness or perceived social\nisolation. Because they believe\nthemselves to be creatures of God,\nChristians feel related to God whatever\nhappens. Whatever their social\ncircumstances--no matter, at the\nextreme, how isolated or strong their\nfeelings of abandonment by human\nothers--individuals are to remember that\nthey remain in a relationship with God,\nwho is concerned about them. Even\nwhen they feel themselves utterly\nforsaken by others, Christians have\nreason to believe God cannot be\nforsaking them. They can believe they\nare never alone even when they appear\nto be absolutely so. In such\ncircumstances, Christians can always\navail themselves of a completely\ncounterfactual sense of social connection\nwith the best-connected “superfriend” of\nall—the God who remains, they believe,\nin a relationship of ultimately beneficial\ncausal efficacy with not just themselves\nbut everyone and everything.\nIt is the very unapparent,\ncounterfactual character of God’s\ninfluence on human lives—the\ninvisibility of God’s influence, in short--\nthat permits Christians to perceive their\nrelationship with God as an unbreakable\nconstant. Because God’s influence is\nunapparent or invisible Christians can\ncontinue to believe God is operative for\ncreation’s benefit in the absence of any\nof the obvious confirming evidence\nrequired in ordinary cases of beneficent\nhuman influence. Christians who believe\nthat God is a universal influence for\ngood as the world’s creator do not\nexpect God to be present in the way one\nexpects a human person to be; and\ntherefore God’s apparent absence, in\nhuman terms, need not break down their\nsense of being in relation to God.\nHaving God as one’s creator (in\nthe best case scenario) is like having a\nperfectly loving human benefactor; but it\nis the unusual invisibility of this\nbenefactor that allows Christians to think\nGod present even when not apparently\nso. Being in a relationship with God for\nChristians who believe God is a good\ncreator is something like being in a\nrelationship with a human person who\nnever lets one out of her sight and who\nintends one’s good comprehensively. It\nis, for example, very like being in a\nrelationship with a loving parent who is\nfully responsible, not just for the fact of\none’s existence, but in a comprehensive\nway for one’s nurturance throughout an\nextended minority. Unlike a relationship\nwith an ordinary human person of that\nsort, however, God is believed to be\ninvisible and this is what allows\nindividuals to assume God’s constant\npresence, all appearances to the contrary.\nThe invisibility that underlies the\nChristian affirmation of God’s constancy\nhere is a function of the very diffuseness\nof God’s influence, a diffuseness of\ninfluence no human person, invisible or\notherwise, could possibly match. Belief\nin God as the creator of the world does\nnot encourage one to single out God as\nthe cause of any specific happening in a\nway that suggests God is one cause\namong many, the cause of this particular\nhappening rather than some other with a\ndifferent cause. Belief in God as the\ncreator of the world does not allow one\nto identify God’s influence in overly\nclose fashion with any particular causal\ninfluence of a beneficent sort. Instead, as\nI have suggested, whatever is of benefit\nto the individual, over the long or short\nterm, taken as a whole, is to be attributed\nto God’s influence.\nThe Christian cannot, then, locate\nor pick out God as one could a loving\nPage | 124\nparent from within the field of variously\noperative forces or influences on one’s\nlife, and for that reason the Christian\nneed neither fear God’s loss nor rue\nGod’s absence as one would such a\nparent’s. Unlike relations with human\nothers, which are situation-sensitive and\nthereby susceptible to change of\ncharacter, rupture, and decline, God,\nChristians believe, is with one, whatever\nhappens, in exactly the same capacity--\nas the creator and sustainer of whatever\nit is that remains good about one’s life,\nbe that only at a minimum the bare fact\nthat one continues to live. The Christian\nwho believes God is his or her creator is\ntherefore confident that God continues to\nwork for his or her ultimate good, that\nGod is engaged in the effort to increase\nit, whatever the impediments in human\nlife suggesting the contrary, absent, that\nis, almost any confirming evidence.\nThe Problem of Inattention\nAlthough invisibility and\napparent absence do not pose the same\nproblem here as they do when God is\none’s friend, this rather more impersonal\nunderstanding of God’s influence as\ncreator and sustainer has its own\nproblem maintaining a strong sense of\nconnection to God. The diffuseness of\ninfluence that lies behind God’s constant\ninvisible presence can prompt simple\nChristian inattention to God. The very\nmonotony of the always pertinent\nChristian affirmation that everything is\nto be attributed to God can make that\naffirmation recede from focal awareness,\nmake it fail to come focally to mind.\nBelief in God’s uniform presence would\nthereby become functionally\nindistinguishable from the sense of\nGod’s absence. The invisibility of God\nthat follows from a belief in the\ncomprehensiveness of God’s influence\nsimply means in that case that God drops\nout of sight and mind, drops out of\nChristian consideration for most intents\nand purposes, most of the time. Such a\nGod has little to offer as a “para-social”\nentity, as a factor fomenting or\nsupplementing a sense of social\nconnection.\nIn the back of their minds\nChristians may believe that God is the\nsource of everything, but they may not\nfeel compelled to consider that fact\nactively in the course of their everyday\nlives. God hides behind, so to speak, all\nthe creaturely influences that God is\nworking through, which become matters\nof primary Christian preoccupation. At\nthe center of attention are all the\nordinary influences and connections with\none’s natural and human environments;\npreoccupation with them pushes out of\nfocal awareness the fact of God as the\nultimate source of them all. Apart from\nspecifically religious obligations—say,\nthe demand to give God thanks and\npraise at times of worship—Christians\nwho believe God is their creator would\nhave no particular reason to dwell on\nthat fact.\nChristian theologians commonly\ntie this sort of practical worry--about\nwhat from a Christian point of view\namounts to sinful neglect of one’s\nconnection to God--to the understanding\nof double agency in the account of\ncreation I sketched above. xv According\nto that account, it is true, God’s\ninfluence on human life does not have to\ngo by way of the human and natural\ncausal powers and influences on human\nlife that God creates; God can influence\nhuman life without producing sufficient\ncreated causes for what God wants to\nhappen in human life. (The Christian\nclaim that Jesus was resurrected from the\ndead—an event without natural causes--\nis a case in point, one that Christians are\nPage | 125\nusually very reluctant to give up.) But\npart and parcel of the account of creation\nis the suggestion that God ordinarily\ninfluences human life by bringing about\nthe very natural and human influences\nthat shape it. In general, because God\ninfluences the world as its creator, God’s\nworking does not begin where created\ncauses break off; God works, instead, in\nand through the created causes that God\nbrings about. Christians are therefore\nable to give a double account of most\nhappenings in the world: one that\ndiscusses what has happened in terms of\nthe coordinated created powers and\nactivities sufficient to explain it within\nthe created order; and one that talks\nabout God’s creative activity in bringing\nabout those same coordinated created\npowers, activities, and their\nconsequences in their totality. It is the\nsufficiency of the explanation in terms of\ncreated causes—the self-containment of\nthat explanation within its own order—\nthat allows human beings to attend to the\ncreated order without taking into account\nthe relationship of dependence upon God\nthat is its presupposition.\nThe temptation to lapse into\nhabitual obliviousness of one’s\nrelationship with God is easily\ncountered, however, by other beliefs\nabout God that Christians hold.\nChristians do not just believe that God is\nthe creator and sustainer of the universe,\nbut believe a lot of other things about\nGod. For example, the common\nChristian belief that God acts as more\nthan a creator in individual lives helps to\ncounter obliviousness to God. God does\nnot merely act as creator by giving\nindividuals the created gifts that make\nthem what they are—for example, their\nown capacities and operations, the\nability to influence and be influenced by\ntheir human and natural environments,\nand so on. God also acts to give them\nGod’s very presence—by way, for\nexample, of their relationship with Christ\nwho Christians believe is God in human\nflesh. The very presence of God in\nhuman life means one’s relationship\nwith God cannot be ignored. The created\ncauses and influences, through which\nGod also influences human life,\nconsequently no longer have the same\ncapacity to distract human attention from\nGod.\nChristians often believe,\nmoreover, that God’s direction of human\nlife by way of God’s own presence to or\nwithin it is no optional matter: God’s\npresence forms an essential component\nof human life. In addition to created\ncapacities and influences brought about\nby God, God’s presence is necessary for\nordinary human capacities to operate as\nthey should. xvi To be morally good, for\nexample, requires not just virtuous\ncapacities of one’s own, given to one by\nGod, but the presence of the Holy Spirit\nwithin one. Knowing well requires not\njust the formation of good ideas through\nthe usual human processes of\ninvestigating one’s environment—the\nentirety of which has its source in a good\ncreator God--but also a mind informed\nby the very Word of God. And so on.\nSuch beliefs imply that attention\nto God’s presence, some sort of Goddirectedness,\nshould be a constant\nfeature of an individual’s everyday,\nordinary life, in order for that life to be\nlived well. The individual Christian is\naccordingly given a reason to bring to\nmind his or her relationship with God,\nmotivated to attend to that relationship\nas much as possible, indeed, in the effort\nto lead a better life. An active Godreference\nbecomes part of a prospective,\ngoal-oriented process of self-reformation\nPage | 126\nin accord with what is believed to be\nGod’s intentions for one.\nBeliefs like this about God’s\npresence as a constituent feature of\nhuman operations are at times\nincorporated by Christians within an\naccount of creation: God’s presence to\nor within them is then believed to be an\nelement of what God as the creator of\nthe world gives to every human being;\nand is in that sense part of the natural or\nordinary constitution of human life that\nGod intends in creating the world. xvii But\nmore often than not the gift of God’s\npresence as an effective influence on\nhuman life is specifically associated by\nChristians with salvation. Human beings,\nChristians typically believe, have either\nlost altogether, or at a minimum,\nhabitually fail to attend properly to a\npresence of God always theirs, in ways\nthat corrupt human well-being. The\nChristian claim is that God saves human\nbeings by giving them the presence of\nGod as an effective force for human\ntransformation in virtue of something\nthat Jesus suffers or accomplishes.\nGod acts as an invisible force in\nhuman lives here because God\ninfluences humans through God’s very\npresence. Christians, if they follow the\ncommon teaching of theologians in this\nregard, believe God is invisible or\nunapparent because God is not capable\nof being delimited or circumscribed by\nthe usual boundary drawing and sorting\nmechanisms used to cordon off and pin\ndown other things. xviii God is not, in\nshort, a kind of thing, set off by clear\nboundaries that distinguish God from\nwhat God is not. But there is also here\nthe kind of invisibility discussed earlier:\nthe invisibility of apparent absence in\nhuman terms.\nChristian claims about salvation\noften have an eschatological edge. They\nfrequently point, that is, to an end time,\nindefinitely deferred from the\nperspective of anything achievable in\nthis life. What God gives to remedy the\nsin of human life through Christ is,\naccordingly, not commonly thought to\nbe fully effective in any visible way in\nthis life. Christians typically think that\ntheir connection to Jesus brings with it a\nnew availability of the presence of God\nas a force for change in their lives, but\nwhat they expect to achieve by way of\nthat constantly available relationship\nremains invisible in the form of an\nalways deferred hope. Once again it is\ninvisibility—here the invisibility of the\nrevolutionary changes in one’s life for\nwhich one continues to hope--that\npermits Christians to believe the\npresence of God, made available to them\nin a new way in Christ for the very\npurpose of bringing about those changes,\nis nevertheless always with them.\nConclusion\nThe main intention of this\nchapter was to make the case that basic\nChristian beliefs are likely to have a\nbearing on perceived social isolation.\nAfter suggesting that Christianity is not\nall of a piece on that score, I developed a\nparticular construal of basic Christian\nbeliefs that would seem to have great\npotential to alleviate perceived social\nisolation through attention to connection\nwith God. While that argument was\nmerely a logical or prima facie one, it\nforms a testable—though as yet\nuntested—hypothesis: Does the\nparticular construal of the beliefs\ncommended here for their\nencouragement of a focal sense of\nconstant connection with God really\nhave those consequences? Do people\nactually feel less lonely, in other words,\nPage | 127\nwhen they hold such beliefs? Can they\nbe made to feel less lonely by calling\nthem to mind? More specifically, how\ndoes the influence of this construal on\nfeelings of social isolation compare with\nthat of other construals—for example, a\nconstrual that directly associates God’s\ncreative influence with the irredeemable\nbad? How might the stronger sense of\nGod’s presence in the hardships one\nsuffers balance out in the latter case\nagainst the unhappy quality of the\nconnection? Might one feel oneself to be\nbetter off alone, in other words, if God is\nas much one’s tormentor as one’s\nbenefactor? Finally, comparable\nproblems to the ones for belief surface in\nthe more experience-driven God-asfriend\noutlook in Christianity, and make\nexperimental testing pertinent. xix If the\nproblem in both cases is that a strong\nsense of connection with God is hard to\nsustain—because God is invisible in the\none case or crowded out by more\nobviously pressing matters in the\nother—how is the imaginative force of\nthe idea of relationship with God better\nshored up? By imagining that one is on a\ndate with God, or by imagining that God\nis always all around one like the air one\nbreathes or the sun that shines? And\nwhat works for the greater number of\npeople? What if the former imaginative\ncapacities are hard to cultivate, and\nrequire in any case exceptional abilities\nof concentration or inward focus that\nmany people lack? Might beliefs be\neasier for most people to hold in mind\nwithout sustained or disciplined\npractice? A simple visit to church or\noccasional perusal of a prayer book\nwould do?\nReferences\n1  For the general importance of belief for such \ninvestigation, see the essays by W. Clark Gilpin \nand Tanya Luhrmann in this volume. \n1  See Luhrmann in this volume. \n1  Thomas Aquinas is one prominent theologian \nin the Christian tradition who highlights this \nidea: “creation . . . is the very dependency of the \ncreated act of being upon the principle [God] \nfrom which it is produced.” Summa Contra \nGentiles, Book Two: Creation, trans. James F. \nAnderson (Notre Dame and London: University \nof Notre Dame Press, 1975), chapter 18, section \n2, p. 55. \n1  See again, for example, Thomas Aquinas, \nSumma Contra Gentiles, Book Two: Creation, \nchapters 31‐38, pp. 91‐115. \n1  See, for example, Martin Luther, Lectures on \nGalatians (1535), in Luther’s Works, ed. Jaroslav \nPelikan (St Louis, Missouri: Concordia Publishing \nHouse, 1964), vols. 26‐27. \n1  Thomas Aquinas again provides a clear \ntheological exposition of this view. See, for \nexample, his Summa Contra Gentiles, Book \nThree: Providence, Part 1, trans. Vernon J. \nBourke (Notre Dame and London: University of \nNotre Dame Press, 1975), chapter 70, section 8, \np. 237: “It is also apparent that the same effect \nis not attributed to a natural cause and to divine \npower in such a way that it is partly done by \nGod, and partly by the natural agent; rather, it is \nwholly done by both.” \n1  For prominent examples of such a view in the \nhistory of Christian thought, see Augustine, The \nLiteral Meaning of Genesis, trans. John \nHammond Taylor (New York: Newman Press, \n1982), chapters 10‐12, pp. 49‐51; and Cyril of \nAlexandria, Commentary on the Gospel \nAccording to John, trans. P. E. Pusey (Oxford: \nJames Parker, 1874), Book 1, chapters 7‐9, pp. \n66‐87. \n1  See, for example, Athanasius, “On the \nIncarnation of the Word,” trans. Archibald \nRobertson, in Philip Schaff and Henry Wace \n(eds.), Nicene and Post‐Nicene Fathers, vol. IV, \nSecond Series (Grand Rapids, Michigan: \nEerdmans, 1957), sections 3‐5, pp. 37‐39. \n1  See, for example, Gregory of Nyssa, “Answer to \nEunomius’ Second Book,” trans. M. Day, in Philip \nSchaff and Henry Wace (eds.), Nicene and Post‐\nPage | 128\nNicene Fathers, vol. V, Second Series (Peabody, \nMassachusetts: Hendrickson, 1994), p. 257. \n1  See Luhrmann in this volume. \nPage | 129\nThe Elusiveness of Meaningful\nConnection\nKathryn Tanner’s chapter has\ndeveloped the classical Christian idea\nthat God is the creator and sustainer of\nthe world, in order to suggest the ways\nin which this notion of the creator might\nbe one factor providing persons with a\nsense of social connection and a hopeful,\ngenerous, and caring disposition toward\nthe world that assuages the adverse\nhealth consequences of loneliness. In\nthis classic interpretation of God as\ncreator, the idea refers not to the origins\nof the universe but rather to the allinclusive\ndependence of life upon God at\nall times. This sense of a sustaining\ndivine presence spanning the whole time\nof one’s life thus contributes a deep\nsense of one’s connection to the whole\norder of creation. However, as Tanner\nnotes, people may become inattentive to\na presence so pervasive, just as people\ncan become inattentive to the forces of\ngravity holding them to the surface of\nthe Earth as they go about their everyday\nlife. In more extreme versions of this\ninattention, the person understands\nhumanity as “alone” in the universe, a\nsort of metaphysical loneliness that\nmight exacerbate more concrete feelings\nof loneliness.\nPerhaps surprisingly, Chris Masi,\nfrom the perspective of a physician and\nmedical researcher, casts a fascinating\nand fresh perspective on the theological\nnotion that we live in a sustaining\nconnection to creation as a whole. After\ndescribing the negative health\nconsequences of loneliness, Masi\nproceeds to describe a cycle of\nloneliness in which a person’s sense of\nisolation frustrates well-intended efforts\nto make social connections. Masi finds\nthat efforts to intervene and break this\ncycle are not notably successful, in large\npart because the preconscious\ndisposition of lonely people toward the\nworld is difficult to change. Like Tanner,\nalthough using different terminology,\nMasi’s review of the scientific literature\nsuggests both that the character of one’s\ngeneral disposition toward the world is\nprofoundly important for one’s\nconnections to others, and that the\nprocesses by which these general\ndispositions change are complex and\nwarrant further scientific attention.\nPage | 130\nChapter 14 14\nVisible Efforts to Change Invisible\nConnections\n14 The lead author is Christopher M.

However, humans reach their\nfull potential only when they are socially\nengaged. Lack of social engagement impairs\ncreativity and learning, and limits opportunities\nfor caregiving and emotional growth. Numerous\nstudies have shown that loneliness is also a risk\nfactor for illness and premature mortality.\nBecause loneliness is increasing in modern\nsociety, it is critically important to understand\nthis condition, as well as strategies to reduce it.\nThis essay describes our review of the literature\nregarding loneliness reduction interventions.\nThe 17 th century English\nphilosopher Thomas Hobbes proposed\nthat without the organizing structure of\ngovernment, humans would experience\nbellum omnimum contra omnes (war of\nall against all) and life would be\n“solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and\nshort”(1). While this colorful description\nis often quoted, less attention is paid to\nHobbes’ premise that such misery can be\navoided if humans codify and enforce\nthe rules of a civil society. Not everyone\nagrees with Hobbes’ views, but history\nis replete with examples of human\nmisery when anarchy reigns and of\nrelative peace when a social contract is\nobserved. A question that philosophers\ncontinue to debate is whether\ncollaboration for mutual benefit is part\nof human nature or whether promotion\nof the self above all others is man’s\nprimary motivation. In this volume,\nCacioppo argues that sociality is an\nintegral part of human nature. He notes\nthat given each child’s prolonged period\nof total dependence, survival into childbearing\nage depends entirely upon the\nsupport and protection of adults, most\noften parents or kin. As a result, those\nwho survive long enough to procreate\npass along genes for nurturing and\nprotection, thereby hardwiring a form of\nsociality into our genetic code.\nThis protective behavior helps\nensure that genes within a family are\npassed on to future generations.\nCooperation among unrelated adults or\nthe support and protection of children by\nadults exists beyond kin, as well,\nbecause these activities also provide\nsurvival benefit. Examples from early\nhuman existence include hunting and\ngathering, which are more likely to\nsucceed when pursued as a group than\nindividually. To these structural benefits\nPage | 131\nof non-familial sociality, we may now\nadd physiological benefits. A 1979\npopulation-based study showed that\nadults lacking social ties were 1.9 to 3.1\ntimes more likely to die during a 9-year\nfollow-up than those who had more\nsocial contacts, all else being equal (2).\nSince then, at least five population-based\nprospective studies (3) and numerous\nsmaller studies have found positive\nassociations between social integration\nand either survival or improved health\noutcomes. The mechanisms by which\nsocial integration enhances survival are\nseveral and include improved health\nbehaviors, increased access to resources\nand material goods, and strengthened\nimmunity against infection (4).\nWhereas sociality is a normal\nstate, loneliness is an unusual state, akin\nto hunger, thirst, or pain (5). As with\nthose states, loneliness is unpleasant and\nserves to remind us that we should\nchange the status quo. Therefore,\nloneliness can be an adaptive motivator\nfor increased social surveillance and\ninteraction. Unfortunately, not all\nindividuals succeed at achieving the\nlevel of social connectedness they desire\nand suffer instead from chronic feelings\nof loneliness. Cacioppo and others have\nshown that lonely individuals interpret\nevents and social interactions more\nnegatively than non-lonely individuals.\nAs a result, they unconsciously develop\ndefense mechanisms, including social\nbarriers, which shield them from insults\nand rejection. While this approach may\nachieve its goals of self-protection, it\nalso reduces opportunities for positive\nsocial interactions and perpetuates\nfeelings of social isolation (5). John\nBunyan, a 17 th century Christian writer\nand preacher, described the barriers\nassociated with loneliness when he\nwrote of a vision in which he\n“saw the people set on the sunny\nside of some high mountain,\nthere refreshing themselves with\nthe pleasant beams of the sun,\nwhile I was shivering and\nshrinking in the cold, afflicted\nwith frost, snow, and dark\nclouds. Methought, also, betwixt\nme and them, I saw a wall that\ndid compass about this mountain\n(6).”\nFor chronically lonely people,\nthe wall between themselves and others\nis partly of their own making and\nreflects continuous surveillance for\nnegative signals from others (5). The\nchallenge is to help lonely individuals\nbreak down the barriers between\nthemselves and others and ultimately\nreturn to the normal state of sociality. In\nhis vision, Bunyan achieved this, but\nonly through great effort:\n“About this wall I thought\nmyself, to go again and again,\nstill prying as I went, to see if I\ncould find some way or passage,\nby which I might enter therein,\nbut none could I find for some\ntime. At the last, I saw, as it\nwere, a narrow gap, like a little\ndoorway in the wall, through\nwhich I attempted to pass; but the\npassage being very strait and\nnarrow, I made many efforts to\nget in, but all in vain, even until I\nwas well-nigh quite beat out, by\nstriving to get in; at last, with\ngreat striving, methought I at first\ndid get in my head, and after that,\nby a sidling striving, my\nshoulders, and my whole body;\nthen I was exceeding glad, and\nwent and sat down in the midst\nof them, and so was comforted\nwith the light and heat of their\nsun (6).”\nPage | 132\nGenetic studies indicate that\nheritability accounts for approximately\n50% of loneliness while social\ncircumstances account for the other 50%\n(7). Research also suggests that\nloneliness is common - reported by as\nmany as 20 percent of the population at\nany given time (8). In addition, some\nevidence suggests that the prevalence of\nloneliness may be increasing, at least in\nthe U.S. A recent national survey found\na threefold increase in the number of\nAmericans who indicated they had no\nconfidant or person with whom to\ndiscuss important matters (9). Although\ndifferences between this survey and its\n1985 predecessor may be sufficient to\naccount for this increase, this suggestive\nreport raises the possibility that\ncontemporary societal factors may be\ninterfering with the natural tendency for\nhumans to form meaningful, long-term\nsocial connections. One factor is social\nmobility, which increased dramatically\nduring the 20 th century. A second is the\naging of the U.S. population. In 1900,\n4.1% of Americans were 65 years or\nolder. By 2006, that percentage had\nincreased to 12.4%, representing 37.3\nmillion Americans (10). With less value\nplaced on older individuals in the U.S.,\nwe have witnessed an increase in\nmarginalization of this segment of\nsociety. Third, as life expectancy\nincreases, more elders are living longer\nas widows or widowers and are therefore\nat increased risk for loneliness. Other\nfactors which may place Americans at\nincreased risk for loneliness include less\nintergenerational living, delayed\nmarriage, increased dual- career\nfamilies, increased single-residence\nhouseholds, and increased age-related\ndisabilities and health conditions. Given\nthe mental and health risks associated\nwith loneliness described in Hawkley’s\nchapter, interventions are needed to help\nlonely individuals regain normal social\nconnections. As Bunyan’s account\nsuggests, breaking through the wall of\nloneliness may require considerable\neffort. When individual effort is not\nsufficient, assistance from others may be\nneeded. Unfortunately, contemporary\ninterventions to reduce loneliness have\nfared more poorly than has been\nrecognized.\nRepairing Broken Connections\nAlmost a century ago, scholars\nbegan to propose strategies for reducing\nloneliness. Karen Rook (11), for\ninstance, amassed over 40 interventions\ndating back to the 1930’s in her attempt\nto identify effective loneliness reduction\nstrategies. Since Rook’s review, five\nscientific publications have provided\nqualitative reviews of strategies to\nreduce loneliness, social isolation, or\nboth (12-16). The most recent\npublication identified 30 interventions\npublished between 1970 and 2002 (16),\nand evaluated the effectiveness of those\nintervention studies that were not flawed\nby poor design. Among the thirteen trials\ndeemed to be of high quality, six were\nconsidered effective, one was considered\npartially effective, five were considered\nineffective, and one was inconclusive.\nThe authors’ conclusions were similar to\nthose of prior reviewers who found that\ninterventions which emphasized social\nskills training and/or group activities\nwere the most successful.\nHowever, qualitative reviews are\nsubject to invisible biases that can color\nour judgments of the scientific evidence\nwe see. Thomas Kuhn, a 20 th century\nphysicist and epistemologist, noted that\nscientists too easily accept results which\nconform to previous intuitions and too\nreadily reject results which do not (17).\nPage | 133\nIn the case of loneliness interventions,\nall of the reviews essentially confirmed\nthe findings of previous reviews that\nsocial skills training and group-based\ninterventions can succeed in reducing\nloneliness. Is this conclusion justified, or\nis this a case in which prior conclusions\nhave been perpetuated in the manner\nKuhn describes?\nTo combat bias favoring results\nthat confirm dominant theories, some\nscientists have argued that specific study\ncriteria should be met to warrant an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the\nintervention (18). These criteria include\nrandom assignment of study participants\nto receive the intervention, evidence that\nthe intervention is more effective than no\nintervention, findings that are replicated\nby at least one independent research\ngroup, and results that are published in\npeer-reviewed journals. Previous\nreviewers of loneliness interventions\nhave, in fact, placed a premium on\nrandomized trials that contrast a group\nrandomly selected to receive the\nintervention with a group randomly\nselected to receive no intervention.\nHowever, none has employed metaanalysis,\na quantitative technique for\ncalculating the average effect of diverse\ninterventions designed to accomplish the\nsame goal. Whereas qualitative reviews\nare subjective and vulnerable to\nconfirmatory biases, quantitative reviews\nare objective and relatively impervious\nto bias as long as all relevant studies are\nincluded in the analysis.\nTo minimize bias in our metaanalysis,\nwe first combed the literature\nto identify all the intervention studies\nthat specifically targeted loneliness. To\nfurther meet our criteria for inclusion in\nthe meta-analysis, studies had to be\npublished in a peer-reviewed journal or\nas a doctoral dissertation (to ensure the\nscientific integrity of the findings),\nbetween 1970 and 2009 (to include and\nextend the time interval reviewed\nqualitatively in prior research), and had\nto measure loneliness quantitatively.\nFifty-two intervention studies for\nloneliness met our inclusion criteria.\nThese studies were divided into three\ncategories based on the experimental\ndesign used to assess the effects of the\nintervention. Twelve studies used a\nsingle group pre-post design in which\nloneliness among participants was\nassessed at baseline and again after\nexposure to the intervention. The single\npre-post design is weak in terms of\nmeasuring the effectiveness of an\nintervention, however, because\nindividuals who have high scores on a\nloneliness measure on one occasion are\nlikely to score less extremely on a\nsecond occasion even if no intervention\nhad occurred. Said differently, people\nwhose measurements suggest they are\nvery lonely at one point in time, on\naverage, appear to be less lonely when\nmeasured at a later point in time. Our\nmeta-analysis of these studies indicated\nthere was indeed a lowering of\nloneliness as measured before and after\nthe interventions, but we cannot\nconclude from this evidence that the\nreductions in loneliness were due to the\ninterventions.\nEighteen studies utilized a nonrandomized\ngroup comparison design in\nwhich some of the participants sought\nout the intervention (the experimental\ngroup) while others (the control group)\ndid not. In this design, assignment of\nindividuals to the experimental or\ncontrol groups was based upon\nconvenience, participant preference, or\nsome other factor, which means the\ngroups that did and did not receive the\nintervention may differ in ways that\nPage | 134\nexplain different outcomes in the two\ngroups. For example, people who\nvolunteer to be in the experimental arm\nof a study may be more gregarious by\nnature and may be more likely to\nbecome less lonely over time regardless\nof exposure to the intervention. Results\nof the meta-analysis suggested the\ninterventions might be effective, but to\nknow it’s the intervention and not an\nartifact of subject selection, we need to\nlook at the effect of these interventions\nwhen assessed using randomized group\ncomparison designs in which\nparticipants are randomly assigned to the\nexperimental or control group.\nTwenty-two studies utilized such\na design. Quantitative analysis revealed\nthat, on average, the interventions had a\nsmall but significant effect in reducing\nloneliness. Moreover, efficacy in\nreducing loneliness did not differ\nsignificantly as a function of\nintervention strategy nor as a function of\nindividual- versus group-based\nimplementation. Whereas once a\nconsensus existed that social skills\ntraining and/or group activities could\nreduce loneliness, we found insufficient\nevidence to support that conclusion.\nWhy have successful\ninterventions to reduce loneliness been\nso elusive? There are several possible\nreasons. Some of the interventions have\nbeen designed with the notion that if\nonly lonely individuals had better social\nskills they would be able to form\nsatisfying connections with others.\nHowever, recent research suggests that\nat least for most adults, the social skills\nthey know are not related to the\nloneliness they feel. Other interventions\nhave been developed with the notion that\nlonely individuals simply need to\ninteract more with others, so the\ninterventions are designed to increase\ncontact with others. However, people\nnot only tend to like lonely individuals\nless than nonlonely individuals, lonely\nindividuals are especially negative\ntoward other lonely individuals.\nTherefore, bringing lonely individuals\ntogether is unlikely to result in warm,\nsatisfying social connections. Finally,\nsome interventions were designed with\nthe notion that what lonely individuals\nneed is social support, such as someone\nwho is available to provide help when\nneeded. However, loneliness affects not\nonly how people think, but how people\nthink about others: loneliness\ndiminishes people’s executive\nfunctioning and biases them to see others\nas threatening and rejecting even when\nthey are not (5).\nCacioppo and Patrick (5)\nproposed a framework for reducing\nloneliness which includes four elements.\nFirst, unconscious barriers that\nchronically lonely people develop to\nshield against being hurt by others tend\nto reduce their likelihood of having\npositive social interactions, and they\nmay benefit, therefore, from\nencouragement and practice in forming\nsocial connections gradually in “safe”\nenvironments where threat of rejection is\nminimal. For instance, because\nchronically lonely people are selffocused\nin their hypervigilance for social\nthreat, they may benefit from learning to\nshift their attention from themselves to\nothers through other-oriented activities\nsuch as volunteerism. The notion is to\nintervene to diminish or eliminate the\nnegative effects loneliness can have on\nsocial perception and cognition. Second,\nwe tend to think of loneliness as the\nsame thing as a personal weakness, as\nbeing a social isolate, being depressed,\nor being weak. As noted above, we now\nknow these accounts to be incorrect, and\nPage | 135\nthat acute loneliness, just like acute\nphysical pain, serves an important\nbiological function for our species.\nBeing aware of how loneliness fits into\nour remarkable achievements as a social\nspecies and what loneliness does to our\nsocial cognition and behavior can help\nus better understand the actions of others\ntoward us. Third, to the extent that\ndesperation for social connections leads\nchronically lonely individuals to\nmisguidedly vest their interest in those\nwho are unlikely to meet their\nrelationship needs, they may need to\nlearn how to be selective and choose\nfriends and groups with whom\nreciprocally rewarding relationships can\nbe expected. This decision is critical to\nsuccess. Research indicates that the\npeople with whom we are most likely to\nform positive, lasting relationships are\nthose who have similar attitudes, beliefs,\nvalues, interests, and activities to our\nown. Therefore, people should not seek\nfriendships based on physical\nappearance, status, popularity, or\nconvenience, but rather on attitudes,\nbeliefs, values, and behaviors. Finally,\nbecause chronically lonely people expect\nto be disappointed with themselves and\nothers in their relationships, they may\nbenefit from training and practice in\ntaking a more optimistic perspective, in\nexpecting the best from themselves and\nfrom others. We play a much more\nimportant role in shaping our social\nenvironment than we often realize.\nAlthough no intervention to date\nhas incorporated all of these elements, at\nleast one randomized trial has\ndemonstrated that an intervention based\nupon volunteerism (Experience Corps)\ncan increase social activity in older\nadults (19). In this trial, older adults are\npaired with grade-school children and\ndedicate at least fifteen hours per week\nthroughout the school year to assist the\nteachers in supporting and encouraging\nchildren in reading, writing, and\nmathematics. This strategy engages at\nleast two of the principles that emerged\nout of Cacioppo and Patrick’s theoretical\nframework (5)—the provision of a\n“safe” venue for making social\nconnections (i.e., the classroom of nonthreatening\nchildren), and the shifting of\nolder adults’ attention away from their\nown concerns and toward the needs of\nsomeone else. In addition, this strategy\ncapitalizes on Erikson’s notion of\ngenerativity (i.e., helping future\ngenerations) (20). Interventions of this\nform deserve further assessment (21).\nConclusion\nWe began this chapter by noting\nthat loneliness is not uncommon and,\nalthough unpleasant, may prompt\nindividuals to attend to and repair their\nsocial connections. Loneliness affects\ncognition as well as well-being,\nhowever, and when loneliness persists it\nis a risk factor for myriad health\nproblems. Previous reviewers have\nsuggested that loneliness can be reduced\nthrough interventions that emphasize\nsocial skills development and groupbased\nactivities. By quantitatively\nanalyzing twenty-two well-designed\nstudies, we found no evidence that these\nstrategies were any more effective in\nreducing loneliness than increasing\nsocial opportunities or social support, or\nmodifying maladaptive social\ncognitions, whether in a group or\nindividual context. A larger number of\nintervention studies may be needed to\ndetermine the relative efficacy of these\nintervention strategies. In the interim, it\nis clear from this review that global\nimpressions and intuitions will not\nsuffice when trying to reduce loneliness.\nFuture interventions should\nPage | 136\nacknowledge that loneliness is not\nsynonymous with social isolation but is a\nsocial pain that functions to motivate the\nformation and renewal of meaningful\nsocial relationships. When feelings of\nloneliness fail to accomplish their\nadaptive purpose, chronic loneliness\nmay ensue. Chronic loneliness tends to\nbe self-perpetuating through\nconfirmatory biases that alter cognitions,\nemotions, and behaviors. Given the\nimportance of social connection to\npeople’s health and well-being, it is\nimportant that we solve the puzzle of\nhow to help the chronically lonely\nconnect with others in meaningful and\nsatisfying ways.\nReferences\n1.

One might reasonably\nexpect that a social species like Homo\nsapiens would have a sufficiently large\nbehavioral repertoire to be able to\nresolve feelings of isolation and restore a\nsense of social connectedness. Although\nresolution is accomplished readily in\nsome instances for some people some of\nthe time, the reality is that at times\npeople are at a chronic loss for how to\nsatisfy their need for social connection.\nUnfortunately, the invisible bonds of\nsocial connection are not easily repaired.\nWe see others’ social activity, but we do\nnot see how they feel about their social\nlives and sense of connection. Despite\nour inability to recognize loneliness in\nothers, or, as Nick Epley and Jean\nDecety argued earlier in this volume,\nbecause of this handicap in seeing into\nthe minds of others, we tend to attribute\nto others what we ourselves have felt or\nwould expect to feel in particular\ncircumstances. Is it any surprise that we\ntarget for intervention those\ncircumstances where we observe few\nopportunities for social interaction,\ninadequate social skills, and poor social\nsupport? On the other hand, because\nloneliness is in the mind of the sufferer,\nit is perhaps surprising that we would\nexpect changes in objective social\ncircumstances to be sufficient to\nalleviate loneliness in all its sufferers.\nMasi provides a quantitative review of\nstrategies employed to alleviate\nloneliness to show that interventions to\ndate have been only modestly successful\nin reducing feelings of loneliness,\nattesting to the challenge of effectively\naddressing the problem of ruptured\nsocial connections.\nInvisibility should not thwart\nattempts to alleviate distress, however.\nBiological causes of disease were no\nmore visible or evident in the 18 th\ncentury than psychological causes are\ntoday. Yet significant scientific advances\nduring the 19 th and 20 th centuries\ncompletely revolutionized medical\npractice, life expectancy, and quality of\nlife. Farr Curlin is less interested in the\ninvisible causes of disease than in the\nprimordial need for social connection\nthat John Cacioppo introduced and that\nCurlin regards as a preexistent condition\nfor medicine. If science can be viewed as\na cognitive system that steps us back so\nthat we can deal more objectively and\neffectively with another person’s\ndistress, then religion can be viewed as a\ncognitive system that steps us forward to\nconnect and care for others. Curlin\nargues that the practice of medicine\nrequires a balance of these forces, and\nthat the resulting tension between the\ntwo produces better care for the patient\nthan does the practice of medicine using\neither alone.\nPage | 139\nChapter 15 15\n15 The lead author is Farr A. Curlin, M.D., a\nhospice and palliative care physician, researcher,\nand medical ethicist at the University of\nChicago. His empirical research charts the\ninfluence of physicians' moral traditions and\ncommitments, both religious and secular, on\nphysicians' clinical practices. As an ethicist he\naddresses questions regarding whether and in\nwhat ways physicians' religious commitments\nought to shape their clinical practices in our\nplural democracy. Curlin and colleagues have\nauthored numerous manuscripts published in the\nmedicine and bioethics literatures, including a\nNew England Journal of Medicine paper titled,\n“Religion, Conscience and Controversial\nClinical Practices.” As founding Director of the\nProgram on Medicine and Religion at the\nUniversity of Chicago, Dr. Curlin is working\nwith colleagues from the Pritzker School of\nMedicine and the University of Chicago Divinity\nSchool to foster inquiry into and public discourse\nregarding the intersections of religion and the\npractice of medicine.\nIn the world of contemporary medicine,\nscience is front and center, and for good reason.\nScience provides modern medicine with\nextraordinary diagnostic and therapeutic\ncapacities that can be employed to care for\npatients. Yet there is more to medicine than\nscience can know. Science cannot provide\nvisions to animate care of the sick, moral\nframeworks to guide the application of medical\ntechnology, or practices that nurture and extend\nour sociobiological capacity to care for others.\nFor these medicine turns to religious and secular\nmoral traditions and practices. This essay\nexamines how religious concepts are implicit and\noperative in practices of medicine and in the\nformation of fully human physicians. By\nattending to these concepts, we may gain a richer\nunderstanding of the way self-conscious human\npractices like medicine both depend on and\nSocial Brain, Spiritual Medicine?\nNo one ever asks what science\nhas to do with medicine any more than\nthey ask what books have to do with\neducation or what tools have to do with\ncarpentry. Before the middle of the 19th\ncentury, there was almost nothing that\nphysicians, however well intended,\ncould do to actually restore health to the\nill. Modern science changed that. Over\nthe past century and a half, dramatic\nimprovements in health outcomes have\nbeen wrought through the application of\nsterile surgery techniques, specialized\nhospital care, public health measures to\nprevent the spread of infectious diseases,\nantibiotics to treat those diseases, and\nmyriad subsequent technologies. All of\nthese have been undergirded by the\ndiscoveries of biomedical science.\nAs a result, the life expectancy in\ndeveloped nations has doubled. People\nlive not only longer but with much less\ndisability. Diseases that formerly\ndisfigured and killed, such as smallpox\nand polio, have been almost completely\neradicated. Epidemics of malaria, yellow\nfever, measles and diphtheria have been\nrestrained. Injuries from war or other\ntraumatic events, which in earlier\nperiods led predictably to death or\nprofound disability, now can be\nameliorated using sophisticated surgical\nreconstruction techniques, advanced\nprostheses, and intensive rehabilitation.\nMedical science already has\naccomplished an extraordinary amount\nin alleviating human illness and\nforestalling death, and there is good\nreason to expect further progress. Yet,\nfor all that science has made possible,\nmedicine is animated by other, less\ntangible, forces.\nextend our unique, human, biopsychosocial\ncapacities.\nPage | 140\nTo give a robust account for the\npractice of medicine, one must explain\nwhy sick and debilitated strangers are\nworthy of attention and care, and how\nthe medical arts contribute to human\nflourishing. For some Americans, such\naccounts begin in secular moral\ntradition, but for most they begin in\nreligion; nine out of ten Americans\nendorse a religious affiliation 1 . Either\nway, medicine looks beyond science to\nfind a vision that animates care of the\nsick, a moral framework that guides the\napplication of medical technology, and\npractices that nurture and extend the\nhuman capacity to care for patients as\npersons rather than as mere objects. In\nthis sense, even though religious\nconcepts are rarely made explicit in\npublic and professional discourse about\nmedicine, they are everywhere implicit\nand operative, and necessarily so.\nWhy care for the sick?\nHumans in all cultures are moved\nto care for the sick. The question is why?\nThe concept of the social brain provides\nthe beginning of an answer. The peculiar\nhuman need and capacity for\nconstructive, complex and meaningful\nrelationships seems to involve\nneurological structures and functions\nthat also facilitate attending to the sick.\nFor example, Epley describes the human\ncapacity to pay attention to our own\nmindedness and the mindedness of\nothers. We are not only conscious of\nourselves, but we are conscious of others\nbeing conscious of themselves and of us.\nThis capacity allows us to be mindful of\nothers’ bodily suffering and mindful of\ntheir consciousness of our relation to\nthem in that suffering. To mindfulness is\nadded the capacity to empathize. Decety\ndescribes a neurological structure\nthrough which the sight of pain in\nanother person triggers a response in our\nown brains that mirrors (albeit at a level\nattenuated by training and other\ncontextual factors) the response we\nwould have if we were suffering the pain\nourselves. These features of the human\nbrain allow us to pay attention to and to\nsome extent share in the suffering of\nothers—capacities that are psychological\nbuilding blocks for caring for the sick.\nYet to explain medicine strictly\non the basis of empirical science, one\nmust solve a particularly thorny version\nof the more general problem of\nexplaining altruistic human behavior.\nDecety notes, “The emergence of\naltruism, of empathizing with and caring\nfor those who are not kin, is … not\neasily explained within the framework of\nneo-Darwinian theories of natural\nselection.” Indeed one can scarcely\nimagine a practice less conducive to the\nreproductive fitness of a population than\nspending enormous resources caring for\nthe sick, the deformed, the weak, and the\naged. Natural selection and the physician\nwould seem to be at cross-purposes: one\nworks to eliminate the sickly, the other\nto save them from elimination. On this\naccount, medicine appears to be the sort\nof dead end into which the evolutionary\nprocess sometimes blindly drifts.\nCacioppo, however, argues that\naltruistic behaviors can be explained\nwithin evolutionary theory by paying\nattention to inclusive fitness and the\nmultiple levels of selective pressure:\n…for species born to a period of\nutter dependency [e.g., humans],\nthe genes that find their way into\nthe gene pool are not defined\nsolely or even mostly by\nlikelihood that an organism will\nreproduce but by the likelihood\nthat the offspring of the parent\nwill live long enough to\nPage | 141\nreproduce… one consequence is\nthat selfish genes evolved\nthrough individual-level selection\nprocesses to promote social\npreferences and group processes,\nincluding reciprocal social\nbehaviors, that can extend\nbeyond kin relationships\nThe concept of inclusive fitness helps to\nexplain why humans care for the young\nwhen they are sick, and even why they\ncare for those who when healthy are able\nto contribute to caring for the young. In\naddition, it may be that hunter-gatherers\nwere more likely to survive and\nreproduce when they cared for a\nwounded or sickened member of the\nclan—thereby establishing an\nexpectation of reciprocity that would\ncontribute to social cohesion, collective\neffort, and defense of other group\nmembers. These provide at least the\nrudiments of an evolutionary rationale\nfor the practice of medicine.\nYet, medicine does not involve\ncaring merely (or even primarily) for the\nyoung, much less for those who are most\ngenetically fit. Rather, medicine in large\nmeasure involves caring for those who\neither have no capacity to contribute to\nthe gene pool because they are aged and\notherwise infertile, or whose\ncontributions to that pool will reduce\npopulation fitness because they are\ngenetically predisposed to sickness and\ndisability. Concern about the latter led\nFrancis Galton and many of his\nAmerican and European contemporaries\nto embrace social Darwinism and to\nchampion efforts to keep the diminished\nand infirm from reproducing. In the\nUnited States, the eugenics movement\nwas memorialized in the infamous words\nof Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell\nHolmes, who justified the\nconstitutionality of the forced\nsterilization of mentally ‘unfit’ women\nin the case of Buck v. Bell by writing,\n“Three generations of imbeciles are\nenough.” Sterilization rates under\neugenic laws in the United States\nincreased following this ruling until the\nSkinner v. Oklahoma case in 1942, after\nwhich point they declined.\nThe practice of medicine\nexpresses more than a straightforward\nsocial instinct for protecting the young.\nTo borrow from Browning, it may be\nthat medicine builds on and extends the\ndynamic of inclusive fitness much like in\nCatholic moral theology caritas (love)\nbuilds on and extends eros (desire).\nBrowning writes, “[Aquinas] held – and\nChristianity has always taught – that\nChristian love includes more than kin\naltruism and the care of our familial\noffspring; it must include the love of\nneighbor, stranger, and enemy, even to\nthe point of self-sacrifice.” The\ntheological concept of God as creator\nand Father of all “made it possible for\nChristians to build on yet analogically\ngeneralize their kin altruism to all\nchildren of God, even those beyond the\nimmediate family, their own children\nand their own kin.” Even those beyond\nthe reasonable hope of reproducing or\nhelping others to reproduce.\nNotably, the self-conscious\ncommitments that animate medicine do\nnot include promoting population fitness\nor ensuring survival of offspring to the\npoint of reproduction. Rather, physicians\ndiscipline themselves to practices that\nmake possible the commitment of\nmedicine: to preserve and restore the\nhealth of patients, notwithstanding\npatients’ other characteristics. Religions\nground this care for the sick in sacred\nand transcendent obligations to God and\nneighbor, and it is not incidental that the\nhospital began when Christian monastic\nPage | 142\ncommunities enfolded the care of the\nsick into a communal life of liturgy and\nprayer. This is not to say that the\nsubstantively irreligious lack proper\nmotivation to practice medicine. It is to\nsay that an animating vision for\nmedicine as a good and worthy activity\nseems to require moral concepts that\nscience alone does not provide.\nHow should medical science be\ndeployed?\nMedicine is not only animated by\nsomething like a religious vision; it also\nrequires a thick moral framework for its\nongoing direction. To know how best to\ncare for patients, we need to know\nsomething about what human flourishing\nentails and how medicine can contribute\nto it. Medical science is less helpful here\nthan one might hope.\nScience facilitates the sort of\nreligious humanism that Browning\nencourages, because it helps us better\nunderstand the empirical world and\ntherefore helps all moral communities\nrefine their efforts to bring about human\nflourishing. Science elucidates a range of\ntechnical possibilities and provides\ninformation about what we can\nreasonably expect as the consequence of\nchoosing one course over another. Yet,\neven the successes of medical science\nhighlight its limits. As medical science\ngenerates technologies that can be put to\never-wider uses, it exposes\ndisagreements about which of those uses\nare worthwhile. Although medicine\nproceeds in scientific ways in the care of\npatients, it does so in pursuit of goals\nthat science cannot set. These goals\ncome from moral traditions and cultures,\nreligious or otherwise.\nIn the same way that the\ninfluence of a dominant culture on\nmedical practice is often invisible or\ntaken for granted precisely because of its\ndominance, so the influence of religious\nideas on medical practice is often\ninvisible in those areas where\ncommitments are shared in common\namong different religions and other\nmoral traditions. For example, we\ngenerally take it for granted that\nmending injuries, treating infections, and\nremoving diseased organs are good\nthings to do. That is because the moral\ncommitments that undergird these\npractices are shared by virtually all\nmoral communities, religious or\notherwise. Moral commitments that are\nshared by all may not seem ‘moral’ at\nall. Yet even the idea of sickness implies\na norm of and concern for health that are\nnot fully derivable from empirical\nscience.\nThe influence of religion on\nmedical practice becomes more visible\nwhere the commitments of particular\ntraditions diverge from one another or\nwhere they diverge from the values of\nthe dominant culture. For example,\nreligious measures have been found\nconsistently to strongly predict\nphysicians’ attitudes regarding ethically\ncontroversial practices such as abortion,\nphysician-assisted suicide, withdrawal of\nlife-sustaining therapies, contraception,\nphysician interaction with patients about\nspiritual concerns and, as we have found,\nphysicians’ ideas about the relationship\nbetween religion and health. 2\nYet overtly controversial issues\nmerely highlight the tips of proverbial\nicebergs. Disputes about practices such\nas abortion or physician-assisted suicide\nconcern whether the practices are\nintrinsically unethical. Much more\ncommonly physicians agree about the\nrange of legitimate clinical strategies,\nbut they disagree about which is to be\nrecommended in a given moment. For\nPage | 143\nexample, physicians may agree that the\nexperience of depression can be treated\nlegitimately by antidepressant\nmedications, referral to a psychiatrist, or\nreferral to a counselor whose practice is\nrooted in a specific religious tradition.\nYet our research suggests that the\nreligious characteristics of physicians\nstrongly influence which of these\noptions they would recommend in a\ngiven case 3 .\nControversies over a particular\nmedical intervention often represent\ndeeper unspoken disagreements that,\nunfortunately, science cannot settle. For\nexample, controversies over the use of\nstimulants to manage childhood behavior\ndisorders, or the medicalization of social\nanxiety, seem to reflect disagreements\nabout more basic questions: What brings\nhuman happiness? Which moods and\nbehaviors should be considered normal\nparts of human experience and which\nshould be considered abnormal? What\nsorts of suffering should we try to\nalleviate? What leads to disordered\nbehaviors? What resources (social,\npsychological, spiritual or otherwise) are\nbest suited to addressing disruptions in\nindividuals’ mental and emotional\nstates? How does modern medicine fit\ninto our response to these experiences?\nAlthough physicians may not ask or\nanswer these questions explicitly, they\nimplicitly answer them in their responses\nand recommendations to patients.\nSo, for all that is hoped for in\n‘scientific’ and ‘evidence-based’\npractice, clinicians must in the end act as\npractical moral philosophers, making\njudgments about how best to pursue the\ngoals of medicine for a particular patient\nin a particular context, all things\nconsidered. Among those things to be\nconsidered are moral valuations about\nwhich religions and other moral\ntraditions have much to say, but about\nwhich medical science remains silent.\nCaring for the patient as person\nSo far I have suggested that\nreligions provide a vision that animates\ncare of the sick and a moral framework\nthat guides the application of medical\ntechnology. Religions make another\ncontribution by fostering practices that\nnurture the human capacity to care for\npatients as persons rather than as mere\nobjects.\nPatients commonly complain that\ntheir physicians treat them as mere\nobjects or specimens rather than\nappreciating and attending to them as\nunique persons. This problem has always\nplagued the profession. To learn how to\nheal, the novice physician must learn of\npatients as representing abstract general\ntypes and classes. She must learn about\ncoronary artery disease and hematuria\nbefore she can begin to interpret Mrs.\nSmith’s chest discomfort and Mr.\nJones’s red urine. These abstractions\nallow knowledge of when and how\nthings happen, and that knowledge\nguides technological interventions that\nmay bring healing to the body. These\nabstractions also help doctors objectify\ntheir patients’ humanity enough to\nviolate social norms that operate in every\nother social situation, such as asking\npatients to expose their nakedness in\nvulnerable positions, or cutting patients\napart in hopes of making them whole.\nAs long as the process does not\ngo too far, scientific detachment serves\nto make our concern effective. Yet the\ncollective experience of both patients\nand physicians suggests that such\ndetachment usually does go too far and\noccurs too easily. As a result physicians\ntreat patients as mere objects and\nPage | 144\ninstances of disease; they treat patients\nas less than the human persons they are.\nPhysicians, it would seem, are\nsubject to a particular form of the more\ngeneral psychological challenge of\npaying attention to other minds. Like all\nhumans, physicians easily ignore the\nmindfulness of others. This matters,\nEpley reminds us, “because mindful\nagents become moral agents worthy of\ncare and compassion.” As such, patients\nwho are seen as mindful “evoke empathy\nand concern for well-being, whereas\nagents without mindful experience can\nbe treated simply as mindless objects.”\nThere are obstacles to recognizing the\nmindfulness of patients. Illness makes a\npatient different, or deviant, from human\nnorms, and we tend to pay less attention\nto the minds of those who are different\nfrom ourselves. In addition,\n“Considering other minds requires some\nattentional effort. It does not come\nautomatically.” Physicians learn to go\nthrough the technical motions of caring\nfor the sick until those motions become\n‘automatic’—that is the mark of a skilled\nand effective clinician. But paying\nattention to the mindfulness of patients\nrequires a sustained investment of time\nand energy that physicians are often\nunwilling to make.\nHow could religious practices\nhelp? As Luhrmann notes, most people\nfind it very difficult to pay attention to\nGod. To help in this difficult and\nlifelong task, many religions have\ndeveloped disciplines of prayer and\nother practices that call to mind what we\ntend to forget—including the ideas that\nmotivate genuine human concern for\nthose who suffer. Christians, for\nexample, practice remembering that all\npeople are ultimately united as children\nof the one creator God, that “the ground\nis level at the foot of the cross”\nregardless of one’s social status, one’s\nbiological fitness or one’s reproductive\ncapacity. Epley notes that we are better\nable to pay attention to what another is\nthinking or feeling when we are\nmotivated to do so. Christianity seeks to\nstimulate such motivation by\nencouraging Christians to meditate on\nthe fact that Jesus comes to us in those\nwho are sick and otherwise suffer 4 .\nMoreover, it reminds us that we are\nnever alone. As Katherine Tanner\ndetails in her chapter, God is always\nwith us. This central theological claim,\nwhen remembered in song, prayer,\nliturgy, reading of Scriptures and other\nrituals, provides a particular form of\nwhat psychologists call “mindful\nsurveillance”—our actions become more\n“prosocial” (even altruistic) when we are\naware of being observed by others. All\nof these practices depend on and extend\nthe capacities of the social brain. They\nare also, from the vantage of\nChristianity, ways in which one may\ncome to receive grace, the unmerited\nhelp of God.\nReligious practices have\ntherefore at least the potential to\nencourage and strengthen the human\ncapacity for attending to the\nmindfulness, and therefore the\npersonhood, of those who are sick and\ndiminished. As Epley suggests, “Making\nminds visible, and hence more like one’s\nown, enables people to more readily\nfollow the most famous of all ethical\ndictates—to treat others as you would\nhave others treat you.”\nConclusion\nScience and religion are invisibly\nand inextricably intertwined in the\npractice of medicine. Science has\nprovided modern medicine with\nextraordinary diagnostic and therapeutic\nPage | 145\ncapacities that can be employed to care\nfor patients. Science gives knowledge of\nthe remarkable neurological and\npsychological features of the social brain\nthat make activities like caring for the\nsick possible. But science can also\ndepersonalize the patient viewed through\nthe eyes of the physician scientist.\nReligions (and other moral communities)\nmotivates an attention to the person who\nis the patient, providing a fuller vision\nfor the worthiness of caring for the sick,\nand drawing the physician and patient\ncloser together. Religion and moral\ncommunities can also provide a\nframework to guide the application of\nmedical science in that endeavor, and\npractices that strengthen the human\ncapacity for treating patients as the\nmindful persons they are. It is the\nbalance of the tensions produced by the\nforces of science and religion that may\nhold a key to better medical practice and\npatient care.\nReferences\n1 Curlin FA, Lantos JD, Roach CJ,\nSellergren SA, Chin MH.\nReligious characteristics of U.S\nphysicians: A national survey.

But objectifying\npatients and their disease would seem to\nwork against the human values of\nempathy and caring for the weak that\nalso seems to be part and parcel of what\nmedicine is as a practice. Curlin argues\nthat religious values inform and nurture\nthe human side by insisting that there\nmust be a connection between physician\nand patient, acting as an often\nunrecognized invisible force that\nhumanizes the practice of medicine.\nReligion is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for an individual to adhere to\nsuch values. The question of what it is\nthat grounds the fundamental values that\ngovern our relationships, and how those\nvalues are reflected in invisible social,\npsychological, and biological forces, is\ncentral to the work of our network. In a\nconcluding essay, Ronald Thisted\nreflects on the many threads of\ninvestigation and discussion that have\nmade up our conversation, and how they\nare interwoven into a network of inquiry\nthat sheds light on invisible forces and\nthe social brain.\nPage | 147\nChapter 16 16\nEpilogue\nOver the past six years, our\nnetwork of scholars has engaged in an\n16 The lead author is Ronald Thisted, Ph.D., a\nProfessor in the Departments of Health Studies,\nStatistics, and Anesthesia & Critical Care at the\nUniversity of Chicago, where he currently chairs\nthe Department of Health Studies. Trained in\nphilosophy and mathematics at Pomona College\nand in statistics at Stanford University, his\ninterests include the nature of argument and\nevidence, particularly in the context of health,\ndisease, and medical treatment. He has\npublished articles on topics ranging from\ntreatment for back pain to computational\nmathematics, and from social determinants of\nhealth to the size of Shakespeare’s vocabulary.\nHe is a Fellow of the American Statistical\nAssociation, and a Fellow of the American\nAcademy for the Advancement of Science.\nThe question of how we come to\nknow—or to claim that we know—things, is left\nunexamined all too often. The similarities and\ndifferences in modes of argument across\ndisciplines, and the variations in what counts for\nevidence supporting or refuting a position within\nand across disciplines can be illuminating.\nStatistics, and statistical argument, provide a rich\nframework for thinking about such issues as\nmeasurement, learning, uncertainty, variation,\nand experiment. Statistical principles provide a\nframework for disciplined investigation, for\ncommunication about the extent of and\nlimitations to the information at hand, and for\ncombining information from different sources.\nAlthough there is enormous variability between\nindividuals, there are also commonalities to their\nexperience that transcend their differences. As a\nspecies and as individuals, we rely on these\ncommon threads, even when they are invisible to\nus.\non-going conversation that we have\ncome to recognize as being centered on\nunseen forces that shape, and are shaped\nby, the social nature of human beings.\nThe essays that make up this volume\ngive a hint as to what our conversation\nhas been like, but the linear structure that\na book imposes cannot fully evoke the\ngive and take of vigorous debate, the\nexcitement of viewing an old problem\nfrom a new perspective, or the\nsatisfaction that comes from sharing the\nsearch for knowledge – even when we\ndid not agree on the interpretation of\nwhat we discovered in our search.\nWe deliberately chose to describe\nour membership as a network rather than\na committee, or seminar, or task force, or\nclub, or salon. A network is defined as\nmuch by the connections between people\nas it is by the individual people\nthemselves. Networks can be described\npictorially as nodes (points that represent\nindividuals), some of which are\nconnected by edges (lines that represent\nlinks between two individuals). In our\nnetwork, we have focused on the value\nof the edges, and have held the\nconviction that much is to be gained by\nexploring previously untested\nconnections. We started with a set of\nnodes having only a handful of edges,\nand we ended with many more edges\nthan nodes.\nAs a result, our network – and\neach individual in the network – has\nbeen enriched as we have learned more\nabout, and more from, perspectives that\ninitially were unfamiliar to each of us,\nthe end result being that our whole is\ndecidedly greater than the sum of our\nparts. This illustrates a recurrent theme\nin the book, that of emergent\nphenomena—characteristics that can be\nascribed to entities at a higher level of\norganization that, without conscious\nPage | 148\ndesign or intent, seem to arise from\nbehaviors and interactions at a lower\nlevel of organization. How this can\ncome about is a puzzle, but it is a puzzle\nthat is amenable to thoughtful\ninvestigation, both scientific and\nphilosophical. What forces are at play,\nwe might ask, that makes such a\ncollection cohesive? Just what\nchemistry can transform a collection of\nindividuals into something both more\nthan and different from what in\naggregate they bring to the table? We\nseek to understand more fully the bonds\nof marriage, family, friendship, or\nmembership—invisible forces that bind\nand simultaneously transform the\nunderlying nature of their constituents\nno less than chemical bonds transform\natoms of hydrogen and oxygen into\nwater.\nOur origin was rooted in distaste\nfor the unproductive and unenlightening\nshouting matches between proponents of\nviews of science that denigrate religious\nbelief and views of religion that are antiscientific.\nWe started from the\nassumption that scholars from the\nsciences and from religion and\nphilosophy could have fruitful\nconversations about what is known, what\ncounts for knowledge, what can be\nobserved, and what can be tested\nthrough experiment and observation.\nAnd we all believe in the value of the\nscientific method as a means for\nexpanding our knowledge. Internal\ntension is needed for the structural\nintegrity of buildings and bridges, and\nthat is no less true of social structures\nsuch as our network. Through\nappropriate construction, deep tensions\nbetween theology and science (or even\nbetween scientific disciplines or\ntheological perspectives) that have the\npotential to drive us apart can instead be\nshaped to release creative energy and\nshared purpose.\nBerntson notes that “beliefs and\nemotions have consequences, both\nbehavioral and physiological.” The\nnetwork starts from the premise that one\ncan learn about such apparently invisible\nphenomena as beliefs by studying and\nreasoning about their consequences.\nIn his essay, Browning advocates\nstarting with a critical hermeneutic\nphenomenology, a “careful description”\nof our instruments, our observations, and\nthe stories we use them to tell. Clearly\narticulating our assumptions and starting\npoints has been of immense value. After\ndoing so for the benefit of colleagues\noutside our disciplines, those colleagues\nin turn have helped us become aware of\nunarticulated assumptions implicit in our\napproaches or in our experiments.\nThese observations have led in turn to\nbetter science and more convincing\nevidence. Our colleagues in the network\nhave helped each of us to see more\nfacets of the same elephant that\nindividually we are too blind to\nappreciate fully.\nRevising our thinking and our\nresearch to take those observations into\naccount has increased the rigor of our\nthought and broadened the scope of our\nconclusions. The presence of a rich\nvariety of disciplinary perspectives has\nhelped us to weave the nets of Sir Arthur\nEddington’s parable more tightly,\nenabling us to see for the first time some\nof the “smaller fish” that earlier would\nhave escaped our notice.\nShedding light on invisible forces (a\nkoan)\nInvisible forces of culture,\nconnection, and curiosity bind us\ntogether and define us as a species that is\nPage | 149\nat once both individual and social.\nBecause both individuality and sociality\nare fundamental to the human species,\nwe are fundamentally interdependent,\nconnected by invisible, yet powerful,\nthreads. In exploring these threads, we\nhave also been led to questions about\nhow social forces can have effects on\nindividuals, how the meaning that\nindividuals (and groups) apply to\nparticular phenomena or relationships\naffect both behavior and biology, and\nhow our biology makes social\nconnection possible. We have used the\nphrase “invisible forces” to describe the\nmechanisms that account for these\neffects that we essentially take for\ngranted, and to suggest by analogy that\nthey can be investigated rigorously just\nas other phenomena, such as gravity or\nautonomic regulation, that also are not\nimmediately present to our visual or\nother senses can be studied.\nHuman minds are unparalleled at\ndiscerning patterns in what they see\nagainst a background of noise and\nvariation, and they are equally adept at\nattributing meaning to them. As the\nessays in this volume demonstrate\nrepeatedly, we readily ascribe patterns\nwe encounter (or seek to encounter) to\ninvisible forces of nature, of God, of\nkinship, of genes, of culture, of love, of\nsocial connection. A common premise\nunderlying the work of the network is\nthat what we know (or what we think we\nknow), and how we come to know it, are\nsocial endeavors embedded in a shared\nview of both the world and how one\ntalks meaningfully about the world. And\nmindful of our human facility to see\npatterns (even where none exist!), we are\nacutely aware that constant rigorous\ntesting of assumptions, methods, and\narguments is necessary to make sure that\nwe are not fooling ourselves into seeing\nonly what we hope to see.\nHumans have a deep need to\ncreate meaning in their interactions with\nthe world and with each other. We also\nhave a deep need for making\nconnections beyond ourselves. The\nbiological structure we call our brain has\nevolved to reward social connection, just\nas it rewards the satisfaction of hunger\nor thirst. The human biology that directs\nand reflects these human needs is what\nwe have termed the “social brain.”\nIt is worthwhile to reflect on the\nrange of invisible forces that we have\nconsidered here. These forces operate at\nseveral different levels, from the\nmolecular, to individual bodily\nfunctions, to social groups, to societies,\nto species. They include such disparate\nideas as evolutionary selective pressure\nfavoring social connectedness,\nanthropomorphism, loneliness, social\nconnection, emergent phenomena,\nconnection to a higher being,\ntranscendence, empathy, language as\ncarrier for meaning, belief, collective\nwill, group synchrony, autonomic\nregulation, and neural resonance. These\nforces interact with one another, too:\nloneliness, for instance, acting as an\ninternal signal of the inadequacy of\none’s bonds of social connection, with\nconsequent effects on health, mediated\nthrough autonomic regulation, or the role\nof belief in mediating scientific\nobjectivity and empathy.\nIt is tempting to view individuals,\nboth souls and bodies, as arising from\nlower-level forces within, such as the\noperation of specialized neurons and\nregulatory biological processes. And it\nis tempting to view social structures and\nthe forces that tend to maintain them as\narising, perhaps emergently, from the\nPage | 150\nindividuals that make up societies. On\nthis view, the social level of organization\narises out of the interaction of lowerlevel\nentities. But invisible forces\noperate in both directions; one’s degree\nof social integration or isolation (at the\nhigher level) can have profound\ninfluence on one’s mental and physical\nhealth (at the lower level). Just how\nthese forces operate—in both\ndirections—is one of the main themes of\nthis book.\nA recurring theme is the human\nneed for connection. As we have\nexplored this fundamental need, it has\nbecome clear that it can be satisfied in\npart by connections not necessarily to\nother human persons, but to other minds.\nSince the minds of others are in part of\nour own construction, connections to a\nhigher being, or to our pets, or even to a\ntranscendent order underlying the world,\ncan fulfill part of what we strive to\nattain. Indeed, such non-human\nattachments can share the character of\nhuman connection: we can feel valued\nby our pet (just as we can feel validated\nin a social relationship), we can have an\nintimate dyadic relationship with God\n(just as we can be intimate with a close\nfriend), and we can feel a sense of\nbelonging to the universe (just as we can\nfeel that we belong to social group).\nThis explains how different, even\ncontradictory, notions of a relationship\nto God, for instance, can lead different\npeople each to find meaning in such a\nrelationship: finding God on the\ndowntown bus versus encountering God\nin the purposeful unfolding of the natural\norder.\nThe ideas of symmetry,\ncomplementarity, coordination, and coregulation\nalso run through several of\nour essays. Regulation of biological\nsystems is often maintained through\npaired systems of biological checks and\nbalances; when one system is activated,\nthe other tends to restore equilibrium.\nFor instance, one set of muscles flexes\nthe arm, and an opposing set extends it.\nWe have seen that the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic components of the\nautonomic nervous system—the system\nthat makes us breathe and that makes our\nheart pump—operate in this way, and\nthat chronic stimulation of some\nsystems, like overstretched elastic bands,\nlose their ability to spring back. The\nnotions of observing a behavior and\nperforming that behavior not only are\nconceptually similar, they may be rooted\nin a common set of neurological\nstructures which may, in turn, help us to\nunderstand how we can perceive another\nhuman being as being like us, but not us.\nAnthropomorphism is the belief that\nother minds mirror our own; this colors\nthe way we perceive the world and the\nother actors in it, a mechanism that\nallows us to simulate getting under the\nskin of the other person.\nHappiness and loneliness are\nperceptions about our place in the world\nthat profoundly affect our physical\nbodies and our social relationships.\nReligious beliefs, too, can have profound\neffects on health and physical wellbeing,\nworking through the same\nbiological mechanisms that in health\nmaintain equilibrium.\nUnseen, yet powerful, forces\nregulate social behavior. Empathy, for\ninstance, contributes to the regulation of\nsocial interactions. Synchronous\nbehavior points to a phenomenon that\nmakes the individual feel subsumed by\nthe group, feeling part of a larger,\norganic whole. These behaviors can be\nas disparate as “the wave” at a sports\nstadium or congregational prayer at a\nchurch service. Shared feelings of\nPage | 151\ntranscendence and belonging can\nsimultaneously lead to greater fitness of\nthe individual and increased cohesion\nand sustainability of the social\norganization—another indication of\npositive selection associated with the\nsocial brain.\nThe notion of resonance with\nanother appears repeatedly through the\nbook. Our connections to others derive\nin part from being able to see what they\nsee, to hear what they hear, to know\nwhat they know, to feel what they feel.\nOr we have to be able to believe not only\nthat this is possible, but that it happens.\nThe social brain, in which the same\nregions are activated by our own\nexperience of pain and by our perception\nof others in pain, makes both aspects\npossible. There is a close connection\nbetween being able to “feel for” another\n(empathy) and to “see into” another\nmind (anthropomorphism).\nLanguage has the potential to\naffect people and groups in part because\nit is tied to meaning. Language is the\nmedium through which we convey,\npreserve, and transmit meaning from one\nindividual to another, and from one\nsocial generation to another. Language\nis powerful because it can activate\nbelief, which in turn can activate\nphysical responses. Words can bind;\nwords can terrify; and words can cause\nphysical pain and death. The power of\nwords comes from the meanings they\nentail about our connections to one\nanother.\nParadox\nOur investigation of invisible\nforces involving the social brain has led\nus repeatedly to factors that\nfundamentally conflict. An important\ninvisible force is the respect we pay to\nthe boundary between self and other.\nOur relationship to it comes into play in\nconceptualizing loneliness,\nanthropomorphism, spirituality, group\nbehavior, empathy, and inclusive fitness.\nWhen we speak of loneliness, this\nboundary seems to be an impenetrable\nbarrier. When we speak of empathy or\nanthropomorphism, however, the selfother\nboundary is defined by the\nsimilarity and congruence of individuals\nto one another, providing a transparent\nwindow through which we perceive and\ninteract with others (who must be like\nus). And when we speak of group\nsynchrony, the boundary vanishes\ncompletely: self and other are one.\nSuccessful engagement with\nothers requires work. It is the work of\nattending to something, and it is work\nthat often is needed to resolve competing\nforces. Thinking about other minds is a\ndemanding task and requires attentional\neffort. It is this effort that allows us to\nmanipulate the transparency of the selfother\nboundary by what we put in\nthrough learning, attending, seeking, and\nprojecting. In effect, we can tune the\ndegree of resonance we have with\nmembers of different groups. Similarly,\nconsistent attentional effort is also\nrequired for the physician to attend to\nthe mindfulness of patients, for the\nVineyard church member to experience\nGod as present in one’s life, and for\nanother to find connection to an\nomnipresent yet invisible God who\nworks through the very workings of the\nworld.\nWhat it means to feel a\nconnection to a higher being is a theme\nthat several essays explore. As is\nevident in these essays, the Network has\nconsidered very different, even\ndivergent, pictures of what such\nconnection might entail. These apparent\ninconsistencies that can be found in\nPage | 152\nthese portrayals are rooted in the\ndifferent aspects of human connections,\nand each is grounded in a social context.\nSocial connection can be intimate,\nrelational, or collective. For the member\nof the Vineyard Church, connection with\nGod is an intimate two-way relationship,\nwhile in Jonathan Edwards’s sermon in\nthe Great Awakening, the connection is\nrelational and involves the coherence (or\nlack of it) of the individual with God’s\napproval. And the Christian theological\nview of connection as a higher order can\nbe conceived in terms of one’s belonging\nwithin a whole that God’s constancy\nmakes larger than oneself.\nWhile religion certainly speaks to\nindividual connection to others and to\nthe divine, religious practices can also\nserve an evolutionary and social function\nby strengthening the human capacity for\nattending to the personhood of those\nwho are sick and diminished. The\nobjectivity of medical science all too\noften leads to an objectification of the\npatient or, more frequently, the patient’s\ndisease. The social brain’s capacity to\nsee others as minds rather than objects\nmakes it possible to assign meaning to\npatients and the ways in which they lack\nwholeness.\nCrescat scientia; vita excolatur\nThe possibility that religion and\nscience can enrich one other, even as one\nsets aside truth claims about such\nmatters as the existence of a deity, is by\nno means obvious. But we have come to\nsee that science can describe what\nreligion does in rigorous ways that\nbenefit religion, and religion can serve a\nmeaning-making function that science\nitself disclaims. Gilpin notes that rifts\nbetween science and religion “have\ncentered on whether one can make\nscientific sense of the notion of divine\nmind, purpose, or intention.” Our\nnetwork sidestepped this question from\nthe beginning, focusing instead on\nrelated matters such as the consequences\nof believing in such a mind, and of\nseeing into that mind, for the one doing\nthe divining.\nThose are questions amenable to\nempirical investigation, and it is at that\njuncture that we can see benefit from our\ndiscussions. As Berntson says, “beliefs\ncolor the way we perceive the world,\nthey direct and shape our actions, and\ndefine our personalities.” Studying and\ndebating about how they do so has been\ngratifying and immensely enjoyable.\nWe have engaged in no theological\ndebate, but have focused on questions\nabout human beings, their beliefs, their\nbehaviors, and how those things affect\nand are affected by multiple levels of\nhuman connection.\nHow we conceptualize our\nrelationships to persons and things\noutside our selves has implications for\nour health and well-being. Specifically,\nwe have seen that viewing our\nrelationships in terms of meaningful\nconnections with other minds can have\npositive implications for individual – as\nwell as social – health and function. The\nmore that we can learn about those\nimplications, the more our increase in\nknowledge has the potential to enrich\nhuman life.\n"
