    "full_text": "﻿05/12/2014 the Cathedral – to Shlomo Gazit\n• As the year 2015 begins, we\nfind ourselves at the height of a\nhistoric earthquake, in multiple\ndimensions, the like of which hasn’t\nbeen seen since the end of WWI and\nthe collapse of the Ottoman Empire.\n• In the Middle East – within\nthree years, the \"Arab spring\" turned\ninto the \"Islamic winter\" – borders\nhave vanished and centuries of\nconflicts between tribes and factions\nare erupting onto the surface.\n• The bi-polar and multi-polar\nworld we knew has been replaced by a\nworld with not even one geopolitical\ncenter of gravity. It is a Gestalt in\nwhich everything depends on\neverything else, and dealing with the\nchallenges requires global cooperation\n.\n• Israel finds itself at the center\nof a kind of \"perfect storm,\"the only\noutpost of the western way of life in\nthe Middle East – at the meeting point\nof the \"clash of civilizations\" between\nIslam and the West, as Huntington\nenvisioned it, and at the same time, in\nthe spinning \"eye of the storm\" of the\nclash of titans within Islam itself:\nbetween Sunni and Shi'ite, between\ntradition, extremism and terrorism on\nthe one hand, and modernity and\nmoderation on the other; between the\ndream of \"past glory\" and the vision of\na \"leap into the future”. And all of this\nis drenched in a lot of blood.\n• This drama that has washed\nover the Arab world bears two lessons\nand one insight for us:\nThe 1 st lesson: \"Be modest in\nprophecy\". In particular, when it comes\nto the future. Mubarak for example had\nabout 400,000 people at his disposal\nworking in various security agencies in\norder to preemptively predict events\nsuch as those that took place at Tahrir\nSquare. And he did not foresee the\nuprising. So who can?\nThe 2 nd lesson: When friends, and even\nthe leaders among us, say: \"Don't get\nswept into a panic – if something really\ngrave happens (Iran for example) – the\nUS will not stand by. The world will\ntake action!\"\nAnd I say: Don't bet on it. Look at Syria.\nAssad has massacred 200,000 of his own\npeople – with tanks, artillery, fighter\njets, even chemical weapons – and the\nworld did not lift a finger.\nAnd the one insight: To all our\nopponents and even friends who tell us\nthat our lack of success in reaching an\nagreement with the Palestinians is the\nroot of all the troubles in the Middle\nEast – the original sin! – I say: this is not\ntrue!\nEven if I, in 2000 (or Rabin and Peres in\n1994 or Olmert in 2008), were to have\nreached a peace treaty with the\nPalestinians – which would have been\nimplemented a long time ago the\n\"Muslim Brotherhood\" would still have\ntaken control over Egypt and Al-Sisi\nwould still have taken it back a short\ntime after.\n• Syria would still have been\nembroiled in a bitter civil war. And\nIran – would still be striving for\nregional hegemony and nuclear\nmilitary capability.\n• The reasons for all the above\nare deeply rooted in the history of the\nnations and the region – and do not\nstem from the Israeli Palestinian\nconflict (they may be related to it in\nanother way, which I will get to later\non).\n• In the new reality forged by the\n\"Arab Spring,\" there is good news and\nbad news for us.\nLet's start with the bad news:\nISIS, the disintegration of Syria, the\nevents in Iraq – all of these are bad news\nthat prove to us, time and time again,\nthat the Middle East is indeed a tough\nneighborhood. There is no mercy for the\nweak, and there will be no second\nopportunity for those who don't defend\nthemselves. Every year, new threats\narise. And the old ones: Hezbollah, Iran,\nterrorism –are all \"alive and kicking\" and\ngrowing even stronger.\nBut there is good news too. Israel is the\nstrongest country in the region, from\nTripoli in Libya to Tehran. It's the\nstrongest militarily, strategically, and\neconomically, and if we know act\nwisely–diplomatically too. Equally\nimportant: Israel will continue to be the\nstrongest country in the region in the\nforeseeable future – especially if we\nmanage to identify and cultivate these\nsources of empowerment and advantage\n– including:\n• Armed Forces capable of\ndefeating any outside combination of\nthreats, including terrorism.\n• A strong and growing economy\nin an open relationship with global\nmarkets.\n• Foreign policy that assures\ninternational backing, especially\nAmerican – diplomatic and economicbacking\nIsrael's positions, and which\nholds the \"moral high ground\" vis-avis\nour enemies and opponents.\n• The fact that Israel is stronger\nthan any combination of enemies is\nwhat enables us to act from a position\nof strength and self confidence in order\nto change the reality : to counter the\nthreats and to seize the opportunities.\n• Let me elaborate briefly about\neach of the threats:\nTwo ironies and one insight about Isis.\nAssad slaughtered 200,000 of his people\nincluding by using chemical weapons –\nand that wasn't enough to get the British\nparliament and Prime Minister Cameron\nor the American Congress and President\nObama to act.\n• Then, ISIS beheaded two\njournalists (not really a new practice in\nthe Middle East) in front of the\ncameras – and within 48 hours the\nworld was united against them. Better\nlate than never, so we have little reason\nto complain about the result. However,\nthere is something to learn about the\nsuperficiality of the decision-making\nprocesses in our world.\nSecond: let's assume for a moment that\nISIS is restrained in about a year (and\nhopefully – crushed) – who wins?\n• The main winner is Assad,\nsince the Coalition would have wiped\nout his main adversary, freeing him to\nfocus more intensely on the rest of the\nrebels – meaning the \"moderate\"\nrebels, which the Coalition purports to\ntrain and reinforce in order to take him\ndown.\nIran also wins and of course Hezbollah -\nall members of President Bush's Axis of\nEvil. In other words: the Coalition is\ndoing some of the \"dirty work\" for them.\n• In my best assessment, the\nTurks are right in their position that\nthere is no point in striking ISIS unless\nyou also set a goal to take down Assad,\nand act to achieve it.\nThe Turks are right in their call for a\n\"humanitarian strip\" – 25-30 km into\nSyrian territory along the borders, and\ndeclare it a “no fly zone”, a place for\nrefugees (there are several million of\nthem) to assemble and where they can\nreceive humanitarian aid.\n• What hasn't been said explicitly\nis that such a deployment might lead\nsooner or later to engagement with the\nSyrian Air Force – followed by the\nSyrian Air Defense – which could\ndevelop into an opportunity to\nfundamentally change the balance of\npower and the course of the war\nagainst Assad's regime.\nAnd one insight: ISIS may not be as\nstrong as it is being portrayed. A\ncoherent ,intense, coordinated action\nduring the next year or two, particularly\nif performed according to the Turkish\noutline and with massive Turkish\ninvolvement – could well put the Genie\nback into the bottle. However – let us\nmake no mistake – ISIS is part of the\nradical Islamic web of terrorism. A web\nthat is loosely knit, yet survives on\nstrictly restricted resources – and\ndemonstrates operational flexibility,\nsurvivability and a fanatic adherence to\nthe goal.\n• We're talking about ALQ,\nJabhat al-Nusra in Syria, Lashkar-e-\nTaiba in India, the Houthis in Yemen,\nthe Shabab in Sumali, Boko Haram in\nNigeria and many more – all across the\nMuslim strip, from Marrakesh to\nBangladesh.\n• And this web is very resilient.\nDealing with it will take war lasting for\na generation, not just a few years. The\nstruggle will require collaboration not\njust between the moderate Arab\nnations and Turkey – but a longstanding\ncollaboration between the US,\nRussia, China, India and Europe – all\nare are potential targets and victims of\nthis terror everyone to some extent.\nForging this collaboration is\ncategorically more important than the\nevents in Ukraine or the North Chinese\nSea Islands.\n• Hezbollah is busy in Syria –\nand would generally prefer to avoid\nprovoking Israel. Some here would say\nthat Nasrallah has been deterred, that\nthe memory of 2006 is still fresh in his\nmind and he will not act. I have my\nreservations about the deterministic\nnature of this statement. \"Deterrence\"\nis a somewhat elusive term. This is not\na \"zero sum game\" on a onedimensional\nbar. This is a complex and\ncontext-related issue. Although under\nnormal circumstances, each side has a\nfundamental position (let's assume for\na moment that Hezbollah's position is\n\"avoid provoking Israel\") – it is still\nnot hard to imagine an event, or\ndamage to Hezbollah's (or Nasrallah's)\nassets or prestige, that could lead it ,\ndespite its basic position, to take action\ncontrary to its true fundamental\nposition.\n• Incidentally, this doesn't apply\nsolely to \"Hezbollah\" – but to us too.\n• Therefore, the working\nassumptions and the operational\ndeployment must include the\npossibility of deterioration into a widescale\nconfrontation with Hezbollah.\n• And now, to Iran – which\nunder certain circumstances might be\nthe element that ignites or incites\n\"Hezbollah\" into action.\n• Let us be clear – a nuclear Iran\nis a central threat to the entire world\norder, not just Israel. A nuclear Iran\nmeans the end of the non-proliferation\nregime– Saudi Arabia, within months,\nTurkey within a few years and Egypt\nmight follow as well–and all will\nbecome nuclear.\n• Every third-grade dictator will\nbe able to ensure his survivability\nagainst the outside world by following\nin the footsteps of Pakistan, North\nKorea and Iran.\n• The \"countdown\" towards the\ntroubling vision of Prof. Graham\nAllison of Harvard about nuclear\nweapons in the hands of terrorists –\nthis countdown, even if it takes 15\nyears, will start. Therefore, blocking\nIran from becoming a \"threshold\nnuclear state\" is crucial, and justifies\nevery effort.\n• Right now diplomacy is in\nhiatus at least until March 2015. It's\nhard to imagine a good agreement with\nthe P5+1, and a bad agreement would\nbe best left unsigned. The problem is\nthat the Iranians have no real incentive\nto reach a “final agreement” that would\nkeep them from becoming a nuclear\npower.\n• As far as they're concerned, at\nany given time an improved \"interim\nagreement\" would be better (unless the\nP5+1 yield to a bad agreement.)\n• The Iranians are very\nsophisticated. In their opinion (I\nemphasize: in their opinion), the\nAmerican government has changed its\ngoal without admitting it, from \"Iran\nwill not have military nuclear\ncapability. Period.\" to \"Iran will not\nhave military nuclear capability on our\nwatch \"\n•\n• This is of course a completely\ndifferent thing. And this perception\nonly reinforces Iran's obduracy and\nthe delaying tactics that they've\nadopted.\n• Israel has a supreme interest in\n\"keeping all the options on the table\".\nHowever, today, mostly against the\nbackdrop of the drawn-out talks –\nIsrael has an interest in maximizing its\nunderstanding with the United States\nand trying to convince it of the need\nfor determination and perseverance;\nfor \"sticks\" as well as \"carrots\"; and of\nthe importance of completely losing\nany illusions regarding the objectives\nof the Ayatollahs' regime.\n• And from here, a sharp segue to\nthe diplomatic challenges Israel faces,\nfrom the minor (for now) to the major.\n• Israel is far from being a leaf in\nthe wind. But the world has no\ngeopolitical center of gravity – not the\nUS, Russia, Europe or China –Israel\nisn't omnipotent either.\n• It is wrong to disregard what's\nhappening in Europe. It will not be\nresolved by saying that Europe is\nridden with anti-Semitism (though\nthere's quite a bit of truth to that).\n• Regarding BDS, I used to tell\nthe members of the Cabinet that– as\nlong as these voices are coming from\nEritrea or Mauritania, we can live with\nit for years. When it comes from\nScandinavia and Britain – it's a\ndifferent story, and must be taken\nseriously.\n• Right now it is being espoused\nby parliaments, not governments. But\nit could expand – to trade unions, to\nthe academia, to consumer\norganizations and NGOs. And then,\nheaven forbid, eventually to\ngovernments – which will say \"we are\nof the people \". We mustn't forget that\nEurope is Israel's No. 1 trading partner\n- not the US and not China. And\nEurope, with North America and a few\ncountries in the East, is at the heart of\nthe \"reference group\" of liberal\ndemocratic countries to which we want\nto belong, and rightfully so.\n• This leads us to the US – and\nthere, the diplomatic challenge is far\ngreater. Israel is a sovereign state. On\nmore than one occasion, I told\nPresident Obama, and before that\nPresidents Bush and Clinton, the\nfollowing: \"On issues that we believe\nare essential to the security and future\nof Israel and of the Jewish people,\nIsrael will make its decisions alone and\non its own responsibility and act upon\nthem. We cannot, and will not want\nto\", I added, \"delegate the\nresponsibility for such decisions,\nwhen required, even to the best of our\nfriends – which is you.\"\nThe US presidents, I note, did not\nalways like this statement – but they\nrespected it.\n• In the same token, I told\nmembers of the cabinet more than once\n– \"we must always remember that the\nUS is also a sovereign state. And it\nexpects us to respect its right to form\nits positions on the issues crucial to it,\nbased on its own interests \". And we\nhave to respect that.\n• Without derogating from our\nresponsibility to make and execute\nsovereign decisions – the reality is that\nthere isn't full symmetry here.\n• Our relations with the US\nPresident, the administration, the\nCongress and the American people are\nvital to the State of Israel.\n• The United States is Israel's\nmain ally and strategic support. Our\nrelations with it are the cornerstone of\nIsrael's military capabilities, the IDF's\nqualitative edge, and Israel's strategic\nand political positioning.\n• We receive $3 billion a year\nfrom the US, going back some 40\nyears now. What social or economic\nbudget items would we forgo to make\nup the ₪12 billion gap if this\nassistance disappears?\n• They're the only ones who can\nprovide us with F-35 jets, the best\naircraft in the world.\n• These are mutually beneficial\nrelations. The US also benefits from\nthe unprecedented cooperation\nbetween our intelligence communities.\nAnd so do we.\nWe never expected, and will never ask\nothers to fight for us – yet the US has\ndeployed advanced radar systems in\nIsrael to provide early warning against\nlong-range missiles, and holds military\nexercises on our soil and in the\nMediterranean , preparing an American\nresponse in case Israel has to defend\nitself against missile attacks from Iran.\n• We received about $1 billion\nfrom the US, by order of President\nObama, for \"Iron Dome\", and\nassistance for the David's Sling and\nArrow programs continues.\n• We turn to the US to veto\nhostile initiatives against Israel in the\nUnited Nations Security Council. Or to\nsoften the conclusions of the\nGoldstone Commission and its ilk.\n• It is to them that we turned\n(and they responded to the best of their\nability) in rather tense times, when a\nhandful of our people were besieged in\nthe embassy in Cairo, with an angry\nmob at the door.\n• Secretary of State Kerry, and\nPresident Obama – went to great\nlengths – and paid a considerable\npolitical (and often personal) price – to\nhelp us achieve a breakthrough with\nthe Palestinians, though the effort did\nnot succeed. Nor did we succeed\n(Rabin and Peres, myself, Olmert and\nBibi as well). They shouldn't be\nridiculed and debased for this. They\nshould be appreciated. Even if we do\nnot agree on all the details.\n• We will yet need their help in\nfacing many trials in the future.\n• I recommend that we all\nremember this well. The rules of\nworking with the Americans: Do not\nmarginalize yourself. Do not fold. Yes\n– remember what the U.S. is for Israel.\nAnd Maintain–at almost any cost –\nmutual relations of trust and respect.\nIt's good for Israel.\n• The American Congress,\nPresident Obama, Biden and Kerry are\npart of the solution, even if it tarries.\nThey are not part of the problem.\n• Ben Gurion used to say, with\nhis iron logic, that \"the future of Israel\ndepends on our strength and our\nrighteousness.\"\n\"Our strength\" – that is the IDF's might\nand its strategic capabilities, the backing\nof the superpowers, our economic\nstrength, and our social solidarity.\n\"Our righteousness\" – not as an abstract\nconcept – is our capacity to hold\nthe\"moral high ground\" by means of a\ncalculated effort to behave and be\nperceived as acting in good faith – to\nobtain peace, even if it delays.\n• This is also an an essential\ncondition for achieving internal\nsolidarity and the world's support for\nIsrael (or for the support of most of the\nworld that's important to us).\n• This is also an essential\ncondition for achieving internal\nsolidarity and willingness for sacrifice\nin a society where being called for\nbattle or routinely risking your life is\nnot a theoretical notion, but rather part\nof our life experience that repeats itself\ntime and again.\n• The fighting spirit, resilience\nand the internal solidarity are deeply\nbound to both our strength and our\nrighteousness. Our righteousness is\njust as important as our strength.\nOur righteousness, and not our strength\nin and of itself, is what gives Zionism's\nstruggle its meaning and sense of\npurpose (especially for ones who can\nchoose). The support of a superpower\n• and the resilience of our society\nand economy, which are among the\ncomponents of our \"strength\" – will\nnever be without recognition of our\nrighteousness. And without it, they\nwill erode\n.\n• This is the time to point out the\nrisk in the weakening of the cohesive\nforces which hold the Israeli society\ntogether. We are turning into an\nincreasingly divided society whose\nvery fabric seems to be ripping apart,\nand which is riddled with hatred for\none another. Left and right. Jews and\nArabs. Secular and religious. Rich and\npoor. Center and periphery. Old and\nnew. This is dangerous. The late\nTunisian President Bourguiba (and\nlater on Sadat in his debates with\nAssad just before the peace treaty with\nIsrael) made the argument that there's\nno need to defeat Israel by force. Give\nthem the opportunity – and they will\ncollapse from within. But the opposite\nis true!\nWe have no intention of collapsing\nfrom within. But this requires that we\ncome to our senses and act with the\nright national priorities in mind for\nsociety and the economy.\n• The young generation, the\nfuture, must be prioritized. And the\nsame applies to those groups in society\nwho carry its burdens:working hard,\npaying taxes and serving in the IDF.\nCultivating mutual respect, openness,\ntolerance, and acceptance of others;\nMore equitable distribution of the\nnational wealth; equal opportunities for\nall and encouraging individuals,\ngroups and communities to take\nresponsibility. All of these are part of\nour mission – and we have a long road\nahead of us.\nI am concerned about our addiction to\ninternal quarrels just as much as I am\nconcerned about our conflicts with\nexternal opponents. Our\n\"righteousness\" will not prevail and\nour \"strength\" will crack over time if\nwe do not act decisively to establish,\ngradually yet persistently , norms of\npublic life and civil society – which\nsets norms for what is done and what\nisn’t done far above the criminal\nthreshold.. We need profound change\nin the area of respect for the rule of\nlaw, standards of governance, keeping\nthe thin line between freedom of\nexpression and freedom of incitement\n– and immediately hitting the brakes\non racism and Jewish terrorism –\nwhich in my opinion should be treated\nwithin the criminal domain..\n• A few sentences on the “nationstate\nlaw”. This is a redundant and\neven harmful law. In general, and\nparticularly at this point. To our friends\nit signals that Israel is losing its selfconfidence\nregarding the obvious –\nnamely,its unique identity as the\nJewish-democratic state as reflected by\nthe \"Declaration of Independence\".\nTo our enemies it provides an effective\ntool to make Israel a suspect– of being\na country that's willingly drifting away\nfrom the norms of democracy – as a\npreliminary step towards\ninstitutionalized discrimination.\nAnd one has to wonder: what was\nwrong with what we had until this\npoint? What's wrong with the\n\"Declaration of Independence\"? Who\nneeds this? And why?\n• Churchill once observed the\ndifference between an optimist and\npessimist.\nThe pessimist – sees the difficultly in\nevery opportunity\nThe optimist – sees the opportunity in\nevery difficultly.\n• We have opportunities before\nus within all of the difficulties. The\nmost important of all, a rare one, the\nkind that comes once in a generation –\nis the opportunity to establish a\nregional agreement. It is all the more\nimportant in light of the \"Arab Spring\"\nand following \"Operation Protective\nEdge\".\nThere is an opportunity to establish a\nregional agreement that fundamentally\nchanges the realities of the region and\nIsrael's future and status within it. An\nagreement that will move the region's\nentire economy forward together with\nthe chance for stability and peace\n,based on synergies and collaboration\nrather than hatred and revenge.\n• What do I mean? The events in\nrecent years have created a strong\ncommon interest for Israel and the\nmoderate Arab countries – Saudi\nArabia and the Gulf States, Jordan,\nEgypt and perhaps even Turkey (which\nis not Arab). The focal interest is the\nstruggle against radical Islamic\nterrorism and against Iran's hegemonic\nand nuclear intentions.\n• The challenge for us is based\non there being, apparently, only one\nway to achieve that; and the upcoming\nelections in Israel force us to put it on\nhold for a few months.\n• And the way to do it is this: a\nstrong, self-confident Israel, willing to\nhold serious negotiations with the\nPalestinians and the group of Arab\nnations within an international\nconference, backed by the US and the\nQuartet – in order to achieve a twostate\nsolution and establish a regional\nagreement, while maintaining an\nunyielding and persistent fight against\nterrorism and ensuring the IDF's\nqualitative military edge over any\ncombination of opponents.\n• The moderates among Arab\nrulers are unable (and also unwilling)\nto float this common interest and turn\nit into policy – because they worry\nhow their people would respond. This\nis how the Palestinian issue is related\nto possibility of an overall agreement\nin the Middle East.\n• And this isn't just an\nassessment.\n• We must remember, vis-a-vis\nthe Palestinians, Israel can (practically\nonly) give. Regarding the rest of the\nmoderate Arab world – Israel can also\nget, and a lot..\nNot just recognition and legitimacy but\nalso an opportunity for regional\ninfrastructure projects – and mostly –\nfor the beginning of a process,\nprotracted though it may be – to\nchange the region's fundamental\nattitudes towards Israel.\n• On the road to seize this\nopportunity – Israel will have to\nconsider embracing the Saudi proposal,\nwith Israel's reservations, as a basis to\nnegotiate a regional agreement.\n• This will take time. There will\nbe ups and downs. The Palestinians are\nnot an easy interlocutor. No one knows\nthat better than I do..\n• This might require long periods\nof interim agreements and even\ncalculated unilateral steps that are\ncoordinated with the US and the\nQuartet.\n• It is possible that within the\ncontext of a regional agreement, the\nPalestinian State, once established,\ncould be integrated into a structure of a\ncloser cooperation that could include\nJordan, Israel and perhaps another\nregional player.\n• But to advance the chance of a\nregional agreement after the elections\nin Israel – the Palestinian issue and the\ntwo-state solution must be at the top of\nthe agenda.\n• The idea that' the radical right\nraises from time to time – to continue\nto rule the entire territory and maintain\na sort of \"autonomy\" for the\nPalestinians – is an illusion at best, and\nthe first step of an upcoming blame\ngame at worst. It will be brutally\nrejected by our closest friends – not to\nmention by each of the potential\npartners for the regional agreement –\nand by all of them together. This too is\nnot a mere assessment.\n• The claim that the events of the\npast year \"prove\" that Israel's vital\nsecurity needs are incompatible with\nthe \"two-state solution\" – is false. And\nI'm stating this as a professional\nposition, not a political opinion.\n• On the contrary – the IDF will\nbe able to defend Israel better from an\ninternationally recognized border that\nincludes the settlement blocs, a number\nof strategic sites on mountain ridge, a\nsecurity zone east of Ben Gurion\nAirport and long-term military\npresence on the Jordan River.\n• The real threat to the future of\nthe Zionist Project – is not the security\nconstraints of the \"two-state solution\"\nbut rather a slippery slope leading to\nthe \"one-state solution\" – a reality that\nwould compromise Israel's security\nand worsen its diplomatic isolation –\nwhile inevitably (and this is the\nkeyword) leading Israel into becoming\na non-Jewish or non-democratic state.\nNot to mention the danger of\ndescending into severe, perpetual\nhemorrhaging, lasting generations, by\nthe two national communities locked\nin embrace– as we have seen in Belfast\nand Bosnia.\n• The vision we all share – the\nvision of a \"model society\" in Israel, of\npositioning Israel, within 10-15 years,\namong the group of the most advanced\nsocieties – in education and culture,\nscience and technology, quality of life\n– and eventually standard of living\n(Finland and Denmark can do it? So\ncan we!). A society in which its sons\nand daughters choose to live . And one\nthat young Jews from all over the\nworld consider a source of pride,\ninspiration – and even a worthy place\nto live in.\n• The vision of a \"model society\"\nwill not materialize unless we gather\nour mental strength and political will,\ndespite the pain and the differences in\nour positions – and together embrace\nthe \"two-state solution under a regional\nagreement\" – which even if it delays –\nis the only appropriate and feasible\nsolution, the only realistic and proper\ngoal for Zionism in this complex world\nof the 21 st century.\n• A friend (from the Likud,\nactually) told me that when he was\nyoung, he visited Ben Gurion's home a\nfew times. In one of their\nconversations, the boy asked the Old\nMan: \"how is it that out of all of the\npeople's leaders in the past 2,000 years,\nand even in the past 80 years, it was\nyou who ended up founding the Jewish\nState?\" And the Old Man answered:\n\"In ancient times, everyone had a sixth\nsense, a sense of recognizing\nopportunities. This sense disappeared\nover time – in most people. But not for\nme! I saw an opportunity – and I\nseized it.\"\nBen Gurion did not speak of the\nhorrors of the War of Independence,\nthe doubts, the risks. many assumed\nwe would fail. He talked about the\nopportunity and recognizing it. And\nthe deed.\n• Like Ben Gurion at the time,\nMenachem Begin – with Egypt, and\nRabin – in the peace treaty with\nJordan, and later Peres – with the first\nsteps towards the Palestinians, took\nhuge national, diplomatic, security and\npolitical risks. Some paid a heavy\nprice. Yitzhak paid the ultimate price.\nBut they all dared – and acted. This is\nthe true test of leadership. This is also\nthe real test of creative statesmanship.\n• Formative leadership had\nalways been rooted in a rare\ncombination and fine balance between\nvision, daring and courage on one hand\nand judgment, complete sobriety and\ngrasp of detail on the other. They will\nnot come where anxiety, pessimism\nand passivity rule – these are recipes\nfor the creating of self-fulfilling\n(necessarily pessimistic) prophecies.\n• The essence and the purpose of\nthe Zionist movement was to defy the\nreality and the mindset that the Exile\ncreated. Its foundation lay in the\ndecision to take our own fate in our\nown hands and move proactively to\nchange reality, and not be swept away\nby the arbitrary waves of history.\n• Reality is knocking on our\ndoor. Not everything is certain.\nNothing is ever certain. And nothing\never will be. Nevertheless – open the\n• door – this is the true trial of\nthe national leadership.\n• Abba Eban used to say – the\nPalestinians have never missed an\nopportunity to miss an opportunity.\n• Let's not fall into this trap –\nourselves.\n• Thank you.\n"
