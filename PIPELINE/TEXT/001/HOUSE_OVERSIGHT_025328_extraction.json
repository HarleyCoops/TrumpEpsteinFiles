    "full_text": "﻿For Radio Host\nOf the Counterculture,\nIt Was a Strange Trip\nBy COREY KILGANNON\nFor a half century, Bob Fass, 85,\nhas presided over the late-night\nairwaves of New York City with a\nradio show named “Radio Unnameable,”\nwhich has aired since\n1963 on WBAI-FM, the listenersupported\nhaven for the radical\nleft.\nAs a self-described “midwife at\nthe birth of the counterculture,”\nMr. Fass, in his time behind the\nmicrophone, has borne witness to\nsome unusual episodes.\nThe second night his show\naired, a listener set the tone by delivering\nmarijuana to the station.\nThere was the time, in 1966, when\nBob Dylan showed up in the studio\nand began taking callers and\ncracking jokes. In 1971, Mr. Fass\nessentially talked a caller out of\ncommitting suicide while on the\nair.\nBut lately, Mr. Fass’s life has begun\nimitating the craziness of his\nshow, ever since he and his wife,\nLynnie, attempted to move out of\ntheir Staten Island home to a new\nhouse in Danbury, Conn., setting\noff a misadventure worthy of one\nof his distressed late night callers.\nLast month, moments after he\nentered his new home, as the\nmovers were carrying in his belongings,\nMr. Fass casually flicked\non a gas fireplace, which promptly\nmalfunctioned and set the house\non fire.\nIt was a two-alarm blaze that\nleft Mr. Fass, who uses a wheelchair,\ninhaling smoke for several\nminutes until the movers rushed\nin and carried him out.\n“I could have been roast D.J.,”\nsaid Mr. Fass. “Have you ever\nheard the Warren Zevon song ‘I\nwas in the House When the House\nBurned Down?’”\nAnd so the “Unnameable” radio\nhost now faces an unknowable future.\nEven in adversity, though, Mr.\nFass, whose show airs Thursday\nnights at midnight, can be counted\non for a pithy take on things. His\nimprovisational monologues and\nhis mix of guests and music\nhelped pioneer free-form radio,\nand his show was a vital forum for\nactivists, musicians, and everyday\npeople to come together\naround issues including the Vietnam\nWar, drugs and social justice.\nAfter the fire, with nowhere else\nto stay, the Fasses returned to\ntheir empty house on Lake Avenue\non Staten Island, near the\nBayonne Bridge, where they live\nwith their 10 or so adopted feral\ncats.\nLOS ANGELES — When\nRobert A. Durst was asked why he\nhad talked to the makers of “The\nJinx” — the 2015 HBO documentary\nabout the suspicions that had\ndogged him for years over the untimely\ndeaths of his first wife, a\nclose confidante and a cantankerous\nneighbor in Texas — he said\nhe had thought it was low risk.\nIt was unlikely, he said, that any\nprosecutor would “commence a\nmajor, budget-busting investigation”\nfor a couple of cold cases.\nBut shortly before the last\nepisode was broadcast, John\nLewin, a deputy district attorney\nin Los Angeles, proved Mr. Durst\nwrong. Mr. Lewin, who has a long\nrecord of winning guilty verdicts\nin cold murder cases, had him arrested\nin New Orleans.\nMr. Lewin would eventually\ncharge Mr. Durst with the execution-style\nmurder in Los Angeles\nin 2000 of his confidante, Susan\nBerman. Preliminary hearings in\nthe case were held in a courtroom\nhere last week.\nThe prosecution contends that\nMr. Durst, the alienated scion of a\nNew York real estate family, killed\nMs. Berman with a gunshot to the\nback of the head to prevent her\nfrom revealing her role in helping\nhim cover up the murder of his\nfirst wife, Kathie Durst, to investigators\nwho had reopened that\ncase.\nIn a sense, Mr. Lewin must\nprove two cold cases, not just one.\n“It is important to understand\nthat all of the defendant’s subsequent\ncriminal conduct can be\ntraced back to his original killing\nof his wife Kathie decades earlier,\nand his subsequent efforts to\navoid criminal culpability for her\ndeath,” he said in court papers.\nMr. Lewin, who declined to be\ninterviewed for this story, has\ntalked to virtually every witness\nin the case, which covers 40 years\nand has a cast of dozens. During\ncourt hearings over the past year,\nhe has displayed an encyclopedic\nknowledge of Mr. Durst, his history,\nhis friends and his alleged\nvictims.\nMr. Lewin has conducted punishing\nexaminations of Mr. Durst’s\nfriends and even of the now-retired\ndetective who first looked\ninto the disappearance of Ms.\nDurst.\n“He’s a pit bull,” said Kathie\nDurst’s brother, Jim McCormack.\nThere is little doubt by either\nside that the hearings, which adjourned\nafter four days of testimony\nand argument, will conclude\nin October with Judge Mark\nWindham binding Mr. Durst over\nfor trial, starting probably early\nnext year.\nBut that does not mean that Mr.\nLewin has a clear path to another\nguilty verdict. Mr. Lewin and his\ncolleagues will still have to contend\nwith hazy, in some cases 40-\nyear-old memories; the lack of the\nweapon in Ms. Berman’s shooting;\nand the absence of a body or\neven a crime scene in the disappearance\nand presumed death of\nMs. Durst, for which no one has\never been charged.\nMr. Durst, 75, frail and worth\n$100 million, has said repeatedly\nthat he did not kill his first wife,\nnor does he know who killed Ms.\nBerman. And despite the certainty\nof a trial, Dick DeGuerin,\nthe Texas lawyer who leads Mr.\nDurst’s defense team, insists that\nthe prosecution has still not proven\nthat Mr. Durst killed either\nwoman.\nAs for the hard-charging prosecutor\nwith whom he has repeatedly\nclashed, “He’s a bully, but\nthat’s not unusual for prosecutors,”\nMr. DeGuerin said of Mr.\nLewin. “And he’s not used to people\nstanding up to him.”\nBoth sides have already invested\nan enormous amount of\ntime and money in the case. Mr.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES NEW YORK TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2018\nBob and Lynnie Fass have\nbeen sleeping on the couch in\nStaten Island since a fire in\ntheir new home in Connecticut.\nMr. Fass with Abbie Hoffman,\nright, circa 1968.\nA single couch now serves as\ntheir shared bed as they sort out\ntheir future. Most of their belongings\neither remain in storage or\nwere damaged by the fire.\nThe bulk of Mr. Fass’s radio archive\nwas recently acquired by\nColumbia University, with payment\nfor the acquisition going toward\nthe new house, he said.\nBut numerous boxes of radio recordings\nthat Columbia had not\nacquired were damaged in the\nfire, Mr. Fass said.\n“There’s a lot of history in\nthere,” said Mr. Fass, who is no\nstranger to dealing with tumultuous\nevents: His show became\nboth a communications and coverage\nhub for Yippie events, the 1963\nMarch on Washington, the 1968\nDemocratic National Convention\nin Chicago and the 1988 Tompkins\nSquare Park riot.\nHis callers have ranged from\nBlack Panthers to John Lennon to\nordinary New Yorkers. One of Mr.\nDylan’s first broadcast appearances\nwas on Radio Unnameable.\nThe Yippie movement leader Abbie\nHoffman was a regular guest,\nas were Hunter S. Thompson, Allen\nGinsberg and Timothy Leary.\nThe Danbury house fire occurred\njust before the Fasses were\nset to close on both the sale of the\nStaten Island house and the purchase\nof the Danbury home. So\nthe fate and details of both transactions\nare in limbo, he said.\nThe Fasses said they signed an\nagreement with the developer\nbuying their house stipulating\nthat they vacate by the original\nmove-out date last month or face\ndaily monetary penalties.\nA lawyer for the buyer did not\nrespond to messages.\nEven if they had the money to\nrent a place, it might be hard to\nfind a landlord who would welcome\na colony of cats, said Mr.\nFass, who had already taken two\nof the cats to the Danbury house.\nDuring the fire, one of them,\nPlutarch, escaped and remained\nmissing for several weeks, until\nMs. Fass found him.\nMr. Fass recently completed a\nthree-month hospital stay and is\nrecovering from heart problems.\nThe smoke inhalation from the\nfire has added a chronic cough to\nhis health concerns.\nMr. Fass, a native of Brooklyn\nwho lived for decades in Manhattan,\nmoved to Staten Island 25\nyears ago, but said he had grown\nweary of the increasing truck traffic\nat a warehouse across the\nstreet.\nThe Danbury house was an affordable\noption that allowed Ms.\nFass to continue to commute to\nher paralegal job in Brooklyn. Mr.\nFass had been broadcasting his\nshow remotely in recent years\nfrom a studio in his house, and\nplanned on doing so from Danbury.\nIn interviews, the Fasses’ broker\nand the lawyer handling the\npurchase of the Danbury house\nboth insisted that the Fasses will\nbe able to move into the house after\na renovation covered by the\nseller’s homeowners insurance.\nBut the Fasses said they have\nno guarantee of this, and with\nmuch of the purchase price for the\nDanbury house in escrow, they\nare being pressured to close on\nthe property.\n“This type of thing is really not\nmy area, and I have no money for\na lawyer to figure it out,” said Mr.\nFass, whose radio career was depicted\nin a 2012 documentary, “Radio\nUnnameable.”\nThe seller of the Danbury home\ndid not respond to an email, and\nher lawyer, Lawrence M. Riefberg,\nsaid he could not comment\nwithout her permission.\nIn a poetic reversal, Mr. Fass recently\ncalled in to his own show —\nwhich is being temporarily handled\nby a colleague, Bill Propp —\nand described the fire story on\nWBAI (where this reporter is an\nunpaid co-host of a weekly talk\nshow).\nMr. Fass said he stopped receiving\na salary from WBAI in 1977\nand relies on Social Security benefits.\nOver the years, some of his listeners\nhave donated to a retirement\nfund for him.\nAfter the fire, some of his longtime\nlisteners — the Fass “cabal,”\nas he has always called them — organized\npages, which have raised\nroughly $2,000.\nOn the radio, Mr. Fass often\nhelped raise funds for demonstrations\nand for legal defenses for\nsuch figures as the boxer Rubin\n“Hurricane” Carter, the activist\nWavy Gravy and Mr. Hoffman, not\nto mention institutions like the\nEast Village Other newspaper.\n“Bob’s been a voice for the people\nfor so long, and so many listeners\nhave called in to his show in\ntheir time of need,” said Jessica\nWolfson, who with Paul Lovelace,\nDurst’s defense is expected to cost\nwell in excess of $10 million, according\nto two people briefed on\nthe matter who requested anonymity\nbecause they were not authorized\nto discuss it publicly.\nMr. Lewin, 54, looks like an outof-shape\nfootball lineman with a\nmodified crew cut. He tells jokes\nat his own expense one minute\nand rails at the defense the next.\nBut he is always about the case.\n“I’m like the sloth,” he told Los\nAngeles Magazine, referring to\nthe mammal that spend most of its\ntime hanging upside down in\ntrees. “I have this one skill.”\nSince he won his first cold case\nin 2002, Mr. Lewin has stacked up\n16 guilty verdicts or pleas, the\nmagazine said.\nHis first cold case resurfaced\nthis year when a state panel ruled\nthat William Bradford, whom Mr.\nLewin successfully tried for the\nmurder of his wife after the case\nlay dormant for 12 years, and who\nis now 84, deserved parole, a move\nthat Mr. Lewin vehemently opposed.\nMr. Lewin’s decision to pick up\nthe Berman case was propelled, in\npart, by the producers of “The\nJinx,” Andrew Jarecki and Marc\nSmerling, who brought the authorities\nwhat they believed was\nnew evidence about Ms. Berman’s\nmurder and the disappearance of\nMs. Durst.\nOn Dec. 24, 2000, the police\nfound the body of Ms. Berman, a\nsometime screenwriter, in her\nBenedict Canyon home in Los Angeles,\nshot in the back of the head.\nSomeone had sent a note to the\nBeverly Hills Police Department\nalerting them to a “cadaver” at the\naddress.\nSuspicion quickly passed from\nMs. Berman’s landlady to her\nmanager before landing on Mr.\nDurst. But once again, little came\nof it.\nIn interviews with “The Jinx”\nproducers, Mr. Durst admitted\nthat he had lied to police in 1982\nabout his whereabouts at the time\nhis wife disappeared and described\nhow his marriage had become\na series of “half arguments,\nfighting, slapping, pushing,\nwrestling.”\nIn a scene depicted in “The\nJinx,” Mr. Durst could not distinguish\nbetween the handwriting on\nthe envelope of the “cadaver”\nnote, which misspelled Beverly\nHills as “Beverley,” and a note he\nhad sent to Ms. Berman with the\nsame misspelling.\nThe documentary ended famously\nwith Mr. Durst muttering\noff camera, “What the hell did I\ndo? Killed them all of course.”\nMr. DeGuerin has dismissed the\ndocumentary as a Hollywood concoction.\nAfter having Mr. Durst arrested\non a murder warrant and gun\ncharges, Mr. Lewin hopped a\nplane to New Orleans and managed\nto interview him for three\nhours before he was arraigned. In\nthe interview, Mr. Lewin complimented\nand cajoled Mr. Durst,\nsuggesting he would never be a\nfree man, although he might be\nable to negotiate a plea.\nThe defense challenged the interrogation\nas “improper and deceptive.”\nMr. Lewin responded angrily\nin a brief to what he described\nas “baseless allegations,”\nalong with a video and transcript\nof the entire encounter.\nWith no witnesses and no murder\nweapon, Mr. Lewin has been\nbuilding a case out of tiny puzzle\npieces. He may have set a record\nfor the use of what are known as\nconditional hearings, in which a\nprosecutor can question witnesses\n65 or older who could die or\nbecome ill before trial — he\nbrought 20 witnesses to the stand\nfor them. A judge must determine\nwhether any of the testimony is\nadmissible at trial.\nIn response to a 12-page motion\nfrom the defense to exclude any\nYANA PASKOVA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES\nROBERT ALTMAN/MICHAEL OCHS ARCHIVES, VIA GETTY IMAGES\nproduced and directed the “Radio\nUnnameable” documentary. “And\nnow he has a chance to move to a\ncomfortable living situation and\nthe whole thing literally goes up in\nflames.”\nResting on his couch in the living\nroom, next to his walker and\nhis oxygen tanks, Mr. Fass disposed\nof a telemarketer by feigning\na heart attack while on the\nphone. Then he sighed.\n“I’m just overwhelmed by everything\nthat’s happening,” he\nsaid. “It might sound amusing, but\nnot when it’s happening in your\nown life.”\nThe Cold-Case Specialist Who Wants to Put Robert Durst Away\nBy CHARLES V. BAGLI\nJABIN BOTSFORD/LOS ANGELES TIMES\nJohn Lewin, a prosecutor in Los Angeles, has an encyclopedic\nknowledge of Robert Durst and a reputation as a “pit bull.”\nstatements Ms. Berman allegedly\nmade to her friends as hearsay,\nMr. Lewin responded in March\nwith what has become known as\n“Big Boy”: a 77-page brief accompanied\nby 316 pages of exhibits.\nAt times, the space between the\ndefense and prosecution tables\nhas crackled. Mr. Lewin once\nmade a remark about “these lawyers\nbeing paid millions of dollars.”\nIt was not long before Mr.\nDeGuerin bounced back with a\ncrack about Mr. Lewin driving a\nPorsche.\nMr. Lewin’s full-court press has\noccasionally rankled Judge Windham,\nparticularly when he continues\nto argue a motion after the\njudge has ruled in his favor.\n“You’re interrupting my thinking,”\nthe normally Zen-like judge\nsaid at one point last Thursday.\n“Please be quiet.”\nThe prosecution scored two victories\nlast week when Judge\nWindham ruled that he would accept\ntestimony from 13 friends\nwho say Ms. Berman confided to\nthem that she assisted Mr. Durst\nin the cover-up and had been expecting\nhim to visit her around the\ntime of her murder. The judge also\naccepted testimony and records\nconcerning incidents of domestic\nviolence in the Durst marriage,\npending challenges by the defense.\nKaren Minutello, the former\nmanager of the Manhattan building\nwhere the Dursts had an\napartment in 1982, testified during\nlast week’s hearing that Ms.\nDurst had called her shortly before\nher disappearance, saying\nthat she was looking for another\napartment in the building because\n“she needed to get away” from her\nhusband.\nA week after Ms. Durst disappeared,\nMs. Minutello said, she\nsaw the porters pulling her notebooks,\ntextbooks, makeup and\nclothing from a jammed trash\ncompactor in the basement of the\nbuilding. Ms. Minutello determined\nthat it had all been shoved\ndown the chute from the Dursts’\n15th-floor apartment.\n“Who does that?” Ms.\nMinutello said. “Their loved one\nmissing and you throw out their\nstuff.”\nShe said she expected to be\nquestioned by the police. She “always\nexpected them to” call, she\nwent on, “and they never did.”\nN\nCorrections\nA21\nINTERNATIONAL\nAn article on Monday about the\nnumber of women and Afro-Cubans\nchosen to serve under Cuba’s\nnew president referred incorrectly\nto research about the racial\nbalance among college students in\nCuba and the United States in the\n1980s. A study by Alejandro de la\nFuente found that the proportion,\nnot the number, of black Cubans\nwith degrees compared with white\nCubans was close, and that the\nproportion, not the number, of\nwhite college degree holders in\nthe United States was twice that of\nAfrican-Americans. The study\nalso referred to graduation rates,\nnot attendance.\nAn article on Monday about protests\nagainst social security\nchanges in Nicaragua misstated\nthe legal changes that allowed\nDaniel Ortega to win a presidential\nelection in 2007. He was allowed\nto win by a plurality, not a\nsimple majority.\nAn article on Sunday about the\nreception of Miguel Díaz-Canel\nBermúdez, Cuba’s new president,\ndescribed incorrectly adjustments\nto immigration policy under\nthe Obama administration.\nPresident Barack Obama ended\n“wet foot dry foot,” a rule that allowed\nCubans who arrived without\nvisas to remain in the United\nStates. He did not end the Cuban\nadjustment act.\nAn article on Saturday about the\nactress Natalie Portman’s decision\nto skip the Genesis Prize ceremony\nin Jerusalem referred incorrectly\nto Scarlett Johansson’s\ndeparture from the charity Oxfam.\nShe resigned as a spokeswoman;\nshe was not dropped.\nBecause of an editing error, an\narticle on Saturday about an auction\nto sell historical objects in\nHeathrow Airport misstated how\nmany passengers Heathrow’s Terminal\n1 could accommodate when\nit was dedicated in 1969. It was\nnine million passengers a year, not\na day.\nBUSINESS DAY\nAn article on Sunday about\nCampbell Brown’s role as Facebook’s\nhead of news partnerships\nerroneously included a reference\nto Palestinian actions as an example\nof the sort of far-right conspiracy\nstories that have plagued\nFacebook. In fact, Palestinian officials\nhave acknowledged providing\npayments to the families of\nPalestinians killed while carrying\nout attacks on Israelis or convicted\nof terrorist acts and imprisoned\nin Israel; that is not a conspiracy\ntheory.\nAn article on Saturday about\nPresident Trump’s criticism of\nOPEC and rising oil prices misstated,\nin one reference, a recent\nincrease in gasoline prices. They\nhave risen 33 cents in the last year,\nnot the last month.\nAn article on Wednesday about\nbudget airlines reinvigorating\nsmaller airports on the outskirts\nof major cities misstated the distance\nbetween Seattle Tacoma International\nAirport and Paine\nField. They are about 37 miles\napart, not 12.\nSPORTS\nAn article on Friday about the\nhesitance of the International Association\nof Athletics Federations\nto allow Russian athletes to compete\nin major track and field\nevents misstated Sebastian Coe’s\ntitle within the organization during\nan extortion scheme. He was\nvice president, not senior vice\npresident.\nTHE ARTS\nA picture caption with an article\non Saturday about the Actors’ Equity\nAssociation’s decision to retire\nthe term “Gypsy Robe”\nmisidentified the “Cats” cast\nmember wearing the garment. He\nis Jeremy Davis, not Jeremy Ford.\nAn opera review on Monday\nabout “The Metromaniacs” by David\nIves, using information from a\npublicist, misstated the number of\nFrench plays from the 17th and\n18th centuries that David Ives has\ntranslated. It is four, not three. The\nreview also misstated the number\nof plays that were collected for “All\nin the Timing.” It is six, not three.\nOBITUARIES\nAn obituary on Friday about the\nrecord producer and songwriter\nRonald Dunbar omitted the name\nof one of his survivors. In addition\nto those named, he is survived by\na daughter, Ginger Atherton.\nAn obituary on April 15 about\nthe actor Tim O’Connor misidentified\nthe county in New Jersey\nwhere Glen Wild Lake, the site of\nan island where he and his wife\nlived for many years, is located. It\nis Passaic, not Essex.\nErrors are corrected during the\npress run whenever possible, so\nsome errors noted here may not\nhave appeared in all editions.\nContact the newsroom:\nnytnews@nytimes.com or call\n1-844-NYT-NEWS\n(1-844-698-6397).\nEditorials: letters@nytimes.com\nNewspaper Delivery:\ncustomercare@nytimes.com or call\n1-800-NYTIMES (1-800-698-4637).\n"
