He is an angry loser who was married to years ago.(She now is married to \nJoe Allen and they live near you in PB) left him because there was no bread on the table and he is nasty. \nWhat should I do?

Not really. \nWho can? The rich and powerful. \nHuh? All they want is the status quo. Or more. \nBut they could --- okay, its not likely, but they could --- turn on the bad actors at their social/economic level. \nFor example: Wall Street CEOs, donors to the Tea Party, etc. \nThat's the topic. Shaming. Shunning. \nOne of the people I deal with --- there are several others. --- is Jeffrey Epstein. \nReading the clips, I don't see that Jeffrey as been shunned. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031691 \nIn this piece --- http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-epsteins-\nsociety-friends-close-ranks/ ---\nI read: \nThe crowd at the events top publicist Peggy Siegal has organized for Epstein proves the point, at least behind closed doors. \"I and \nmany others that know him describe him as brilliant,\" says Siegal. \n\"His unique mind is what attracts the world's smartest people to his home.\" Last September, with Siegal's help, Epstein hosted a Break \nFast after Yom Kippur. A group of 120 friends brought their children over for a buffet dinner \nThis was just a few months after he finished his prison obligations in Florida. \nAnd here he is, entertaining --- with children present. \nThis Break Fast is one of a number of social events involving post-prison Jeffrey that attracted celebrated, powerful people. \nOf course I have zero idea who said, \"NO WAY\" and didn't cross his doorway. \nMy questions are: \n1) I You have known him for decades, were/are friends, etc. \nWhy was your reaction to his crimes to continue being his friend --- and not in a covert way? \n2) What would he have had to do for you to shun him --- to cut him out of your life? \nYou're the ultimate professional; you may not want to respond. \nEspecially because I'm NOT reaching out to anyone else who's named in the piece. \nI don't care about them. \nBut it ain't me to blindside you. \nJK \nOn Apr 30, 2011, at 4:03 PM, Peggy Siegal wrote: \nWould love to talk to you.
