Ghislaine Maxwell? \nI know from the court filings and hearing transcripts, that Mr. Epstein was deposed in this action, but was not \nexpected to be called as a live trial witness. \nAccording to the transcripts - it was represented by plaintiff's counsel during pre-trial hearings, that Mr. \nEpstein invoked his 5th amendment rights and declined to answer substantive questions during the \ndeposition. It also appears that Judge Sweet had not yet made a final determination as to whether Mr. \nEpstein's depo, or selected portions thereof, would be admitted at trial (which is obviously a moot point, \nnow). \nIf you believe any of that to be in error, and/or if you wish to provide a statement about the settlement or in \nresponse to Giuffre's allegations about your client, please give me a call or reply to this email. \nIf you have no comment, I'd appreciate you letting me know that. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022941 \nThanks \nJames \nJames Hill \nSr. Producer \nABC News \n190 N.
