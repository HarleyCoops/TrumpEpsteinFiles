ARES\ncould be the first to convert, but this is largely priced in. These\nfirms have more sticky management fee-related earnings\nvs. BX/CG/KKR that may see less benefit.\nWe believe ARES could be the first Alt stock to convert; we\nwould view that as a positive catalyst for the group that, if successful,\ncould lead others to follow. ARES reports 4Q earnings on\nFebruary 15, and we expect a potential announcement or indications\nof mgmt's intentions and/or timing. C-corp conversion has dominated\nour conversations with investors of late with increased\ninbound questions including interest from some new to the Alts. As\na result, in this report we expand on prior work here, and here, creating\na C-corp conversion scorecard with qualitative pros/cons for\neach company. We also evaluate the potential valuation impact if\nAlts convert, and we take a deep dive into how the market might\nvalue two earnings components in a C-corp structure: 1) sticky, recurring\nmanagement fee-related earnings and 2) performance fees.\nWe see an opportunity for Alts to unlock value by shedding the\npartnership structure and converting to C-corps. Changing from\na partnership structure could help alleviate the complexities of current\nK-1 tax reporting and expand the universe of eligible investors in\nthe Alts. Some investors today are restricted from investing in limited\npartnerships, while others don't want the operational and tax\ncomplexities of investing in a partnership structure.\nManagement fee-related earnings could re-rate higher toward\n22.5x in our upside case, as we look at three different approaches\nfor valuing this sticky earnings stream: 1) traditional asset manager\ncomps vs. organic growth, 2) publicly traded C-corp Alts comps,\nand 3) an approach looking at FRE as bond yield proxy with a credit\nspread, to determinate an appropriate cap rate.\nPerformance fees appear cheap (at 6.1x) if management fees\nre-rate to 22.5x in the context of Alts converting to C-corps and a\n24% overall tax rate. This suggests the market is misvaluing performance\nfees, and we could also see Alts performance fee earnings\nre-rate higher if C-corp conversion expanded the investor base.\nWe see companies that have a greater skew to management fees\nas best positioned for conversion, as we see the greatest potential\nfor multiple expansion on for this portion of the earnings. For stocks\nunder coverage, we see APO as potentially being able to unlock\nthe most value, with near-term upside to current prices of 26%,\nif the shares re-rate. We see ARES as another winner from conversion\nbut the we belive this is priced with shares up 23.5% YTD. Our\nanalysis suggests a less favorable upside/downside scenario for conversion\nfor companies under coverage with lower taxes and/or\ngreater exposure to performance fees (KKR, CG, BX).\nExhibit 1:\nUpside/Downside Scenario Impact to Alts' Share Price if They Convert\nto C-Corps from Current Partnership Structure\nEstimated Change to Curent Share Price\nMorgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

What would this\nmean for valuations? We think the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\ncould accelerate cost-benefit analyses and decisionmaking\nby management teams as a 21% federal tax rate vs.\n35% previously implies less tax leakage and less expense in\nmoving from single-layer taxation to a double taxation\nstructure. While investors would give up economics in the\nprocess, the new business structure would, we think, command\na higher valuation multiple.\nFor context, investor questions on the topic have picked up\nrecently, including from a number of long-only accounts,which\nhave historically avoided the Alts. Some investors have said they\ncurrently cannot invest in Alts given the partnership structure but\nwould be interested and able to do work on them if they were to convert\nto C-corps. We had conversations around conversion a year ago\nas President Trump took office amid promises of tax reform, and the\nsubject came up on nearly every 4Q16 earnings call. Management\nteams seemed to table the idea because of too many moving parts\nthat needed to be clarified before they conduct a proper cost/benefit\nanalysis. Post tax reform, conversion is at the top of investors' minds\nand becomes a key debate/catalyst for the sector.\nWe believe Ares Management L.P. (ARES, Equal-weight) could be\nthe first Alt to convert to a C-corp, potentially sparking other\nconversions within our coverage. We believe this prospect has\nlikely driven much of the stock's 24% return year-to-date and +16%\noutperformance vs. the S&P 500 and +10% its Alts peers. Over the\npast few months, ARES management has stated clearly that they\nhave been actively considered conversion. CFO Mike McFerran\nrecently told investors, \"This topic has become clearly very elevated\nin light of possible tax reform. Absent that and even before this\nbecame so topical, this is the thing we've been thinking about. And\nthe overarching question is, can public traded partnerships attract\nthe breadth of shareholder base to support an appropriate valuation\nnotwithstanding some other obstacles.\" Even without tax reform,\nthe company was considering the structure change, and with a 21%\ncorporate statutory rate (vs. 35%), we believe cost-benefit analysis\nmay make sense for ARES. The company reports earnings on\nThursday, February 15, and we expect an update or additional\ncolor on conversion. We think all Alts shares could benefit as\ninvestors see a higher probability of others following in their\nfootsteps and/or investors re-rate Alts' FRE higher.\nAgainst this backdrop, we've created a conversion scorecard\nwith qualitative pros/cons for each company. To be clear, these are\nour views on where conversion makes the most sense and not calls on\nwhich companies will commit or the timing of potential conversions.\nWe focus selectively on the factors we view as most important in\ndeciding whether to convert.\nl FRE % of Earnings — We believe the higher fee related earnings\nas a % of total earnings, the more likely for a re-rating of\nthe shares and therefore more likely to consider C-corp conversion.\nl Effective Tax Rate — The lower the current tax rate, the\nmore tax slippage if companies convert and are subject to a\nhigher corporate tax rate, and lower EPS. Conversely, companies\nwith a higher tax rate today already have more tax\nleakage, and thus could make sense to pay a little more tax in\na corporate structure for a broader investor base.\nl Current P/E Ratio — The lower the current P/E multiple, the\nmore management may be inclined to take action to drive a\nre-rating.\nl Management Commentary — Lastly we look at management\ncommentary from earnings calls/conferences to assess\nthe extent that companies are evaluating conversion and seriously\nconsidering it as a strategic option.\nExhibit 2:\nBased on our qualitative scorecard, our work suggests APO and ARES\nmay be most likely to convert\nCompany\nRating\nCore FRE % of\nEarnings\nENI Effective Tax\nRate\nCurrent P/E ratio\n(2018e)\nManagement\nCommentary\nAverage Overall\nScore\nARES (ARES) Equal-weight 100% 25% 25% 100% 63%\n0 0.75 0.75 0 38%\nApollo (APO) Overweight 75% 50% 50% 50% 56%\n0.25 0.5 0.5 0.5 44%\nOaktree (OAK) Overweight 50% 50% 25% 50% 44%\n0.5 0.5 0.75 0.5 56%\nKKR (KKR) Equal-weight 25% 0% 75% 75% 44%\n0.75 1 0.25 0.25 56%\nCarlyle (CG) Overweight 0% 75% 75%\n0\n38%\n1 0.25 0.25 1 63%\nBlackstone (BX) Overweight 50% 0% 50% 50% 38%\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research estimates\n0.5 1 0.5 0.5 63%\nMORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH 5\nM\nM\nFor Ares, we believe conversion makes sense, given the company\nis largely a play on fee related earnings from draw down funds,\nseparately managed accounts, and their relationship with ARCC, the\npublicly traded business development company. Earnings from performance\nfees at ARES are a smaller portion of overall profitability,\nwhich is furthered by relatively higher compensation payout on performance\nfee revenues, which in turn approach 80% in strategies\nsuch as private equity vs. peers typically in the 45-55% range. The\ncompany could benefit as a first mover and if the stock price reacts\nfavorably, we could see other alternative peers follow suit.\nApollo in our view may stand to benefit the most from conversion\nwith the best risk reward skew in our analysis using a SOTP\nframework. Why? Similar to ARES, the company has meaningful\nfee-related earnings as a percentage of overall operating income.\nThis is largely driven by their advisory relationship with Athene,\nwhere APO earns a fee on ~$74b of assets and should benefit from\nadditional management fees from the company's most recent $24b\nflagship private equity fund.\nOur deep dive suggests Apollo has relatively longer-duration\nstickier assets under management vs. peers, which gives us\ngreater confidence in APO's fee-related earnings stability,\ngrowth, and potential for a re-rating. Apollo's AUM has a 12-year\nduration on average (measured as outflows and realizations as a percentage\nof beginning of period AUM). This is noticeably better than\nHLNE's at 9.1 years, which trades at 23.4x P/E, and below Partners\nGroup of 16.7 years, which trades at 28x P/E.\nWe see Blackstone as potentially less likely to convert, but see\na more nuanced story at KKR given their token dividend policy;\nfor both we do not see as much valuation upside from a re-rating\nof FRE multiples. BX and KKR have larger concentration to performance\nfees and as a result we see less of an impact to potential upside\nshould fee related earnings multiples re-rate. Our estimated tax rates\nfor KKR and BX are also significantly lower than the group given the\nearnings mix and other offsets. We see a greater downside to current\nshare prices if there was a conversion that had a higher tax drag and\nmultiples did not expand. That said, KKR has a history of making\nmajor changes, such as its payout policy change in 2015 that\nsharply reduced the dividend with a shift in strategy to grow book\nvalue. At the time we thought such a change by KKR was a prelude\nto converting to a C-corp, as we wrote here. However, the stock has\nlagged and KKR's limited/token dividend means investors do not\nreceive the full benefit of a flow through partnership structure\nwith single-layer taxation. So we again raise the question, Why not\nconvert to a C-corp with a token dividend that is effectively single\nlayer taxation?\nC-corp Conversion Could Be the Catalyst\nto Unlock Value and Drive Multiple\nExpansion\nThe alternative asset managers trade at a steep discount to\nbroader financial peers. We believe this is largely due to 4 factors:\n1) volatility of the earnings (particulary performance fees) and questions\nas to alpha persistency going forward by public market investors,\n2) complicated business models, 3) corporate governance\nconcerns, and 4) corporate structure as a partnership. We do not\nexpect to see the first three factors change, but conversion could\nmake a meaningful difference by:\n1) Expanding the universe of eligible investors in the Alts,\n2) Alleviating the tax complexities of current K-1 tax reporting,\n3) Unlocking value via multiple re-rating, particularly for management\nfee-related earnings in the widely used sum-of-the-parts valuation\nfor Alts. We could also see incremental upside to current\nvaluations if multiples on performance fee earnings adjust upward\n(more details below).\nExhibit 3:\nAlts trade on average FY2 of 10.5x, a 28% discount on average to other\nfinancials subsectors\nAlts vs. Financial Subsectors P/E\n30.0x\n25.0x\n20.0x\n15.0x\n10.0x\n5.0x\n0.0x\n1%\n24.1x\n-4%\n22.1x\n-10%\n-13%\n-15%\n18.5x 17.7x -28% -21%\n16.0x -27% 15.4x 14.9x 14.7x\n13.6x 12.7x\n-33% 12.4x 12.0x -26.0%\n11.2x 10.6x 10.8x\n-42% -39%\n-51%\n-55%\n2018 P/E Alts % Discount/Premium (RHS)\n10%\n0%\n-10%\n-20%\n-30%\n-40%\n-50%\n-60%\nSource: Company Documents, Morgan Stanley Data\nNote: P/E multiples for other financials subsectors aside from brokers and asset managers are based on\nMorgan Stanley Estimates as of 1/18/2017\n6\nM\nM\nOn average the group currently\ntrades at 10.8x on 2018e EPS with\nan average effective tax rate for\neconomic net income (the metric\nused for EPS calculations) of\n9.6%.

The actual\nimpact is very difficult to quantify given the variety of moving pieces\nand the reliance on investors to drive the a re-rating. We have presented\nit as a scenario analysis to evaluate conversion on a risk\nreward spectrum. Upside/downside scenarios show a positive skew\nfor companies that have higher earnings contribution from management\nfees vs. more downside skew for companies with more performance\nfees (less certain re-rating of performance fees).\nAs the examples herein illustrate, we see significant value in the\nre-rating of fee-related earnings that could unlock share value\nand result in higher stock prices. We believe these stable and\ngrowing fee earnings can support higher multiples and broader own-\nership of the Alts and be the catalyst for the re-rating (explained in\ngreater detail in the sections that follow). In both our upside and\ndownside approaches we look at a Sum-of-the-Parts that values at 1)\nfee-related earnings, 2) balance sheet investments and net cash, 3)\nthe net accrued carry balance, and 4) future value of carry. In both the\ncurrent and upside case we use a fully taxed fee-related earnings at\na 24% tax rate and our value for the balance sheet remains\nunchanged in both scenarios as well.\nHowever, we make several adjustments to our upside and downside\ncase to reflect a C-corp structure with full tax rate on all earnings: 1)\nTax the net accrued carry receivable balance at a 24%. 2) Tax our estimate\nfor average net carry earnings at a full 24% rate. Further, in the\nupside case we also adjust the multiple upwards for fee related earnings\ndriven by broader ownership of the stocks, and we conserva-\nExhibit 6:\nPotential Upside Scenario SOTP Valuation for APO.

As a result we have looked at\nthe share price of ARES at several time periods to assess what is\nembedded in the price already.\nHow do we arrive as such an estimate? We start with the 12/31/2017\nshare price of $20.00. We then gross up this starting point for the\nbroader performance of peers to isolate just the outperformance of\nARES vs the group. The alts group ex ARES YTD is up +10% so we use\na starting price for ARES of $21.90.\nl We first estimate the implied multiple on future carry for\nARES at the pro forma stock price before C-corp conversoin\nbegan to be priced in. (we explain this in process in greater\ndetail in the section on Deconstructing Our Implied Carry Valuation).\nl We then take the current share price today and assume that\nthe run up in price was a result purely from multiple expansion\non fee related earnings. In doing this we hold the performance\nfee multiple and value of future performance fees\nconstant.\nl We then back into an implied value of FRE using the various\ncomponents of the SOTP and the current share price. We\ndivide that value by our 2018e FRE to determine our estimate\nfor baked in multiple expansion at ARES. (Please see Ares\nManagement SOTP and Sensitivity Analysis for more\ndetails.)\nWe see the market valuing ARES's FRE at 18.3x, with about 3.4x turns\nof multiple expansion YTD and pricing in a large degree of the potential\nbenefit from C-corp conversion. This is just under half of the total\n7.5x turns of FRE multiple expansion that we expect to see in our\nupside scenario for the Alts. As a result, our upside/downside from\nfor ARES has a less favorable risk reward skew, as much of the upside\nis already baked in.\n10\nM\nM\nWhy Should Fee-Related Earnings\nRe-Rate Higher?\nWe point to three approaches to thinking about how to\nvalue fee-related earnings and what the right multiple\nshould be on this earnings stream. We believe that under\na C-corporation structure with a broader potential investor\nbase and ownership, this portion of the Alts earnings are\nmost likely to re-rate significantly higher while there could\nbe more variability in the multiple investors ascribe to performance\nfees. We currently believe the market is pricing in\nfee related earnings around 15x times, a discount to where\nthese earnings could trade up to. As we explain in greater\ndetail in the Appendix, we see ARES as a stock that is likely\nto convert, and as we take a look at the SOTP, we believe\nFRE for ARES has already seen significant expansion. We\nestimate the multiple on ARES FRE has already gone up\nfrom 15.0x to 18.4x.\nBelow we look at where multiples could trade for the broader\ngroup as a whole, but acknowledge that investors likely use different\nFRE multiples for companies to account for duration of assets,\ngrowth in AUM, franchise value etc. On average, our three\napproaches suggest a 23.4x multiple for fee related earnings. In our\nupside case we use a 22.5x multiple. These multiples are on 2018e fee\nrelated earnings as we are trying to evaluate where the stocks trade\ntoday, and where they could potentially trade to in the near term.\n1) Premium to Traditionals Asset Managers\nExhibit 11:\nThe average of our three approaches to FRE multiples suggests and\nFRE multiple of 23.4x\nFRE Multiples Across Three Approaches\n35.0x\n30.0x\n25.0x\n20.0x\n15.0x\n10.0x\n5.0x\n0.0x\n15.4x\nTraditionals\nMethod\n26.0x\nC-Corp Alts\n28.9x\nBond Yield\nCap Rate\nAverage\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research estimates\n23.4x 22.5x\nAverage\nMSe Upside\nCase\nExhibit 12:\nTraditional managers trade at a 15.4x FY2 P/E multiple with average\nnet flows of just +1% during that time period\n25.0x\n20.0x\n15.0x\n10.0x\n5.0x\n0.0x\nCovered Trad.

The traditional\nasset manager business model earns management fees with a\nsignificantly smaller portion of revenues from performance fees relative\nto alternative asset managers.\nWe believe the Alts' management fee earnings, however, command\na premium multiple given several factors: A) faster organic\ngrowth, B) stickier long-term committed assets, C) fees paid on committed\ncapital which limits downside risk to revenues, and D) more\ninsulation from fee pressure.\nA) Faster net organic growth in fee-paying assets under management\nfor Alts vs. slower growth rates at traditional asset managers.\nThe Alts have outpaced organic growth rate of traditional\nasset mgrs over the past 4 years by nearly 700 bps, and we estimate\n900bps of continued outperformance on average from 2018\nthrough 2019.

As you can see in the following exhibit based on fullyear\n2016 data, we see larger redemption rates from traditional asset\nmanagers (those that disclose redemption rates) relative to alts. For\ntraditionals we look at total redemption rates. For the alternatives\nwe look at realizations/harvesting of investments along with\nredemptions of open ended products from fee paying AUM as it is\nmore comparable to traditional asset managers. If we take 1 divided\nby the redemption rate, we can back into an average duration of\nassets under management.

This provides much more stability and downside\nprotection, but limits upside to management fees as investments\nappreciate in value do not automatically translate into higher\nmgmt fees. The Alts then participate in investment performance\nthrough performance fees or carried interest, whereas the traditionals\nparticipate in performance via greater management fees on a\nhigher value of invested assets.\nD) Relatively more insulation from fee pressure in private markets\ngiven limited low cost competitors (indexed funds and ETFs for\ntraditionals) and higher demand for products driven by the search for\nhigher return and diversification from investors. In fact, recent\ndemand for some PE funds has actually led to supply constraints and\nallowed Alts to give less fee concessions. Apollo, for example, closed\nfundraising for their flagship Fund IX last year at $24b, but the\ndemand was 25% higher at $30b. As a result, the company said \"economics\nto Apollo for Fund IX are considerably better since we did not\nneed to provide as many management fee discounts.\" This supports\nthe forward look on growth in management fee revenues; however,\nwe could see some mix shift into lower return profile (and lower fee)\nproducts that could begin to pressure fee rates over time.\n23%\n15%\n9%\nWe see Hamilton Lane (HLNE, Equal-weight) and Partners Group\n(PGHN, Equal-weight, covered by Anil Sharma) as offering an\nupside scenario for Alts' fee-related earnings multiples.\nHamilton Lane is ~90% fee earnings and currently trades at 23.4x\nmultiple on our CY2018e EPS. Similar to alternative asset manager\npeers, the company gets paid management fees on drawdown funds\nand customized separately managed accounts with stable fees paid\non committed capital. PGHN is a publicly traded alternative asset\nmanager in Switzerland, and as a C-corporation it is the closest true\ncomp for HLNE.\nWhile we see the publicly traded C-corps as good comps, there\nare several factors that could be elevating the multiples. HLNE is\na small cap stock with $2b market cap and may not be the best comp\nfor the large cap PE firms. The company has limited float (currently\nat ~25%) and scarcity value as the only US based publicly traded alt\nin a C-corp structure. PGHN is a trades in Europe and may not be a\ngreat comp because of that. Lastly, while not drastically different,\nHLNE and PGHN have had higher organic growth historically and\nlooking out over the next 2 years we expect their growth to outpace\nmost of the alts. As a result of the high multiples at the public C-corp\nalts, we have heard partnership alts increasingly use HLNE as a peer\ncomp.\nExhibit 17:\nWe expect Alts to deliver similar organic growth profile over the next\nfew years as C-Corp Alts Hamilton Lane and Partners Group\nOrganic Asset Growth:C-Corp Alts vs. Partnership Alts\n20%\nAvg. 2014 - 2017E Growth Rate Avg. 2018 - 2019 Growth Rate\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\n-5%\n4%\nAPO\n18%\n-2%\n11%\n9% 10%\n8% 8%\nCG\nKKR\nBX\n8%\n6%\nARES\n0%\nOAK\n6%\n14%\n11% 11% 11%\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research\nNote: HLNE average organic growth includes years 2015 - 2017e where we have data; The alts average\nuses 2014 - 2017e for consistency with the traditionals organic growth chart above\nHLNE\nPGHN\n5%\nAlts Average\n10%\nMORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH 13\nM\nM\nExhibit 18:\nHLNE Currently Trades 23.4x on FY2 P/E (an 18% premium to when the\ncompany began trading after going public in early 2017); Partners\nGroup currently trades at a 28.2x P/E (a 21% premium to its last 3 year\naverage P/E ratio)\nC-Corp Alts FY2 P/E Multiple\n29.0x\n27.0x\n25.0x\n23.0x\n21.0x\n19.0x\n17.0x\nHLNE\nPGHN\n28.2x\n15.0x\nJan-15 Jul-15 Jan-16 Jul-16 Jan-17 Jul-17 Jan-18\n23.4x\nSource: Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley Data\nNote: Hamilton FY2 EPS estimates are on the company's fiscal year basis, the twelve months ending 3/31\nHLNE and PGHN P/E multiples as of 1/12/2018 based on consensus EPS\n3) Bond Yield Approach\nOur third approach to coming up with the appropriate multiple\nfor fee-related earnings is to compare fee revenues to a similar\nto a bond with a 10-year duration given the locked-in nature of\ncommitted capital with fees paid on commitments (Par Value) as\nopposed to paid on NAV. Importantly, the Alts are increasingly\ngrowing permanent capital or very long duration capital that has\nattractive life-time value of the contract. APO has the largest\namount of permanent capital, representing about 43% of AUM,\nfollowed by ARES at 16%. This results in a stable stream of revenues,\nhowever there could be variability on the expenses that would\nimpact fee related earnings. Under the bond approach the \"default\nrisk\" in this scenario would be counter party risk that management\nfees would not be paid by limited partners. These LPs include sovereign\nwealth funds, pensions, and other institutional investors that we\nview as highly unlikely to default.\nOur methodology starts with the 10-year US treasury yield, given\nthe similar duration to the life of the draw down funds management\nfees. We then add an appropriate credit spread on top of the 10-year\nyield to account for the risk that these institutions \"miss\" payment of\ntheir management fees. We also consider the fact that not all fee\npaying assets under management at the alts are subject to lock ups\n(such as hedge fund AUM, open ended funds). Those alts with larger\namounts of permanent capital or longer duration of assets would\nsuggest a lower credit spread given less risk of lost revenues in our\nview.\nWe look at AA and BBB credit spreads as a proxy for high and low\n\"default risk\" for LPs paying management fees. AA credit spreads\nare currently at 53bps and BBB are currently at 122bps. Again, the risk\nof \"default\" is likely overstated by using these yields but we show this\nrange to account for other factors including differences in duration\nof assets. We then add these spreads to the current 10 yr treasury\nyield of 2.62% to get a yield of 3.15% and 3.84% respectively. Lastly,\nwe capitalize these yields to back into implied FRE multiples by\ntaking 1 divided by each of the yields. This implies a multiple of 31.7x\nusing AA spread and 26.0x using BBB spread. Finally we take an\naverage of the two credit spread approaches to get to 28.9x.\nExhibit 19:\nPermanent capital represents 15% of AUM on average for alternatives\nand we see 63% on average with a contractual life of 7+ years\nAlts Contractual Life of AUM\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n7+ Years at Commitment Permanent Capital\n89%\n84% 83%\n80%\n78%\n72%\n43%\n41%\n67%\n57%\n67% 86%\n59%\n58%\n63%\n16% 15% 13%\n3% 1%\n15%\nAPO ARES BX KKR CG OAK Avg\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research\nNote: KKR permanent capital refers to capital of infinite duration.

We believe that at current\nshare prices, the market is valuing fee-related earnings 15.0x.\nThis represents an 1.8x turn premium or +13% premium to current\ntraditional multiples on 2018e EPS of 13.2x. Using this as a starting\npoint, we see the market valuing performance fees at 7.5x on\naverage using a sum of the parts framework. If we assume C-corp\nconversion with a higher 24% tax rate, and believe alts' fee related\nearnings can re-rate from 15x to 22.5x, then we see the market valuing\nperformance fees at just 6.1x on average today.\nWhere should performance fee-related earnings trade? Given\nthat carry earnings (performance fees) are cyclical and historically\nvolatile, we look to Goldman Sachs as a comp for this earnings\nstream. On average since 2010 (post crisis) the FY2 price to earnings\nmultiple at GS has been 9.5x, with a standard deviation of 1.4x.\nWe see a range of multiples of +6.7x to +12.3x using two standard\ndeviations above and below the average. We see this as reasonable\nstarting point for valuing performance fees. The group average\nimplied future carry multiple of 7.5x is 1.4 standard deviations away\nfrom GS FY2 P/E multiple. If alts convert, we believe this multiple\nshould be able to move upward but will likely remain at a steep discount\nto the FRE multiple given the volatile nature of the performance\nfees. In our upside case scenario, we bake in two turns of\nmultiple expansion from current implied rate for each company. This\nresults in median performance fee multiple across the group of 8.5x,\nabout slightly less than one standard deviation from GS FY2 multiple\nsince dating back to 2010.\nOn a cash basis, the volatility of performance fee earnings (net\ncash carry) for the alts on a TTM basis has been fairly similar to\nthe volatility of Goldman Sachs's operating earnings. For\nGoldman, we look at operating earnings both with and without\ninvestment management revenues to isolate the more volatile businesses.\nThe following bar graph looks at the standard deviation of\nthe year over year % change of the trailing twelve months earnings.\nThe alts average is 1.2 about double the volatility of GS (ex investment\nmanagement) of 0.6. This suggests even further upside and\ngreater conviction in our multiples for performance fee multiples,\nespecially for those companies with less volatility (Carlyle and KKR).\nExhibit 24:\nWith a 24% tax rate on all earnings and a 22.5x FRE multiple, we\nsee future performance fees valued at and implied 6.1x multiple\non average.\nImplied Future\nCarry Multiple\nusing a 15.0x\nFRE multiple\nImplied Future\nCarry Multiple\nusing a 22.5x\nFRE multiple\nAPO 5.1x 2.0x\nARES 11.6x 8.4x\nBX 9.5x 9.3x\nCG 6.0x 7.1x\nKKR 7.0x 5.4x\nOAK 5.5x 4.5x\nAvg. 7.5x 6.1x\nMed. 6.5x 6.2x\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research\nNote: We use a 18.4x multiple for ARES as the stock has already priced in much of the potential\nvalue of C-corp conversion Note 2: Scenario using 15x FRE does not use fully taxed net accrued\ncarry and future carry while the scenario using a 22.5x FRE multiple assumes C-corp conversion\nand full 24% effective tax rate on both net accrued carry and future carry earnings.\nExhibit 25:\nGoldman sachs has historically traded at an average FY2 P/E of 9.5x\nand a standard deviation of 1.4x\nGS FY2 P/E Multiple\n14.0x\n13.0x\n12.0x\n11.0x\n10.0x\n9.0x\n8.0x\n7.0x\n6.0x\n5.0x\nJan-10 Jan-12 Jan-14 Jan-16 Jan-18\nSource: Thomson Reuters, Company Data , Morgan Stanley research\n+2 St. Dev 12.3x\n-1 St. Dev 10.9x\nAvg 9.5x\n-1 St. Dev 8.1x\n-2 St. Dev 6.7x\nNote.: Data includes daily FY2 P/E ratios to calculate standard deviation of P/E ratios using data beginning\nJanuary 2010\n16\nM\nM\nExhibit 26:\nAlts Net Cash Carry Volatility vs. GS earnings volatility on a TTM basis\nY/Y TTM Historical Earnings Volatility (St. Dev)\n3.0\n2.4\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n1.6\n1.5\n1.2\n0.9\n0.4\n0.3\n0.5\n0.6\n0.0\nBX OAK APO Alts\nAverage\nARES KKR CG GS GS Ex-\nIM\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research\nMORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH 17\nM\nDeconstructing Our Implied Carry Valuation:\nWhat Is the Market Paying?\nWe deconstruct the various pieces of a SOTP for the alts\nin order to determine our best guess on how much the\nmarket is valuing future performance fees. We then\ndivide that implied value by future performance fee earnings,\nto determine the implied multiple that the market is\npaying for this earings stream. This is the groundwork for\nour upside and downside scenarios if the alts were to\nconvert to C-corps.\nWe simplify our the SOTP and standardize it across the group to\nlook at 4 main components. 1) after-tax core fee-related earnings,\n2) balance sheet value of investments plus net cash/debt, 3) net\naccrued carry balance, and 4) future value of performance fees. The\nvalues of the balance sheet and net accrued carry receivable are\nstatic items with balances as of 3Q17. We then adjust the multiple on\nour core FRE to determine a value for what we believe the street is\nusing. To be conservative, we use 15x as a starting point for what we\nbelieve is currently priced in. We then take the current share price\nand subtract out the value of the FRE, net accrued carry performance\nfees and the balance sheet and we are left with an implied value of\nwhat the market is pricing in for future carry. Once we have the future\ncarry value, we divide by the net performance fee earnings per share\nfor each company and get an implied multiple on the future performance\nfees. Using this approach and a 15x multiple on FRE, we see the\nmarket is valuing future performance fees at 7.5x on average and a\nmedian 6.5x.\nWe make several key adjustments in the SOTP valuations: First,\nwe use our own Morgan Stanley definition of \"core fee-related earnings\"\nin our calculation. We use our core approach as we attempt to\nnormalize the various definitions of FRE across the companies. The\nmain difference vs. company-reported FRE is that we fully burden all\nexpenses, including equity-based compensation. KKR differs the\nmost on company-reported vs. MS Core FRE. For more information\non our core FRE methodology, please see our note Alternative Asset\nManagers: Who's Got Swimsuits? (19 May 2016).\nWe also make adjustments for ARES an OAK. For Ares: a significant\nportion of the fee related earnings come from Part 1 BDC fees.\nThese are investment income sharing fees from their management\nagreement with ARCC. In the MS approach, we value these separately\nfrom more traditional management fees. However, we do not\nbelieve that the market looks at the fees this way, and so we include\nthem in the total FRE by using the same multiple as we are using for\nFRE (15x). For presentation purposes in the table below, we break out\nthe BDC Part 1 fees separately for ARES to show the value. OAK: We\nadjust the balance of OAK's investments on balance sheet to account\nfor OAK's 20% ownership stake in DoubleLine which it currently\nholds at cost of $21m as adjusted under the equity method of\naccounting. With the benefit of lower corporate taxes we currently\nvalue OAK's ownership stake at $1B. We do not believe the market\ngives full value for this 20% ownership and haircut our MSe value by\n50% to $500m. We then add this value to the balance of investments\nand net cash for OAK's total balance sheet value.\nExhibit 27:\nMarket Implied Value of Future Carry at current share price and 15x FRE multiple\n= B+C+D = A-E-F = E + F + G = G/H\nA B C D E F G H I J\nTicker\nCurrent\nPrice\n2018E\nCore FRE\nFRE\nMultiple\nCore FRE\nValue Per\nShare @\n24% tax\nRate\nAfter-Tax\nBDC\nValue Per\nShare\nBS Value\nPer Share\nSOTP\nValue Ex-\nCarry Per\nShare\nPre-Tax Net\nCarry\nReceivable\nPer Share\nMarket\nImplied\nValue of\nFuture\nCarry\nTotal\nValue Per\nShare\nPre-Tax Avg.\nNet Carry Per\nShare (2018-\n2019)\nImplied\nFuture\nCarry\nMultiple\n18\nAPO $36.42 669 15.0x $18.94 $0.00 $2.72 $21.66 $2.16 $12.61 $36.42 $2.45 5.1x\nARES $24.70 185 18.4x $12.02 $3.70 $0.69 $16.41 $1.03 $7.26 $24.70 $0.63 11.6x\nBX $36.78 1,196 15.0x $11.36 $0.00 $2.83 $14.19 $3.01 $19.59 $36.78 $2.07 9.5x\nCG $25.60 100 15.0x $3.34 $0.00 $0.85 $4.19 $4.40 $17.01 $25.60 $2.85 6.0x\nKKR $24.40 475 15.0x $6.38 $0.00 $9.71 $16.09 $1.74 $6.57 $24.40 $0.93 7.0x\nOAK $45.20 166 15.0x $12.11 $0.00 $15.19 $27.30 $5.76 $12.14 $45.20 $2.20 5.5x\nAverage 7.5x\nMedian 6.5x\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research estimates\nM\nM\nUpside Scenario\nStarting with the framework laid out above, we make several key\nadjustments in our upside scenario to illustrate where we think multiples\ngo and where the stocks can trade over the near term if the alts\nconvert. Our upside scenario implies an average share price increase\nof 13% across the group.\nl First we fully tax effect the performance fee earnings.\nUnder a C-corp structure these would not get the passthrough\nbenefit and would be subject to full taxes. We use a\nfull 24% tax drag on the net accrued carry receivable balance\nand the future net carry per share.\nl Second we adjust the FRE multiples upward. As we discussed\npreviously with our three approaches for FRE multiples,\nwe believe there is significant upside to the value of\nthese earnings if alts were to convert. This drives nearly all of\nthe upside from current prices in our upside scenario. We use\na 22.5x multiple on FRE in our upside case, which represents\n50% increase from the 15x multiple that we believe is priced\nin today.\nl Last we assume 2x of multiple expansion for performance\nfees. As a starting point, we look at the implied multiples\nusing current share prices and a 15x multiple for FRE as\ndescribed above. We then add 2x turns of multiple expansion\nto each of the companies' current implied multiples. We look\nto the Goldman Sachs example earlier in the note as a comp\nfor cyclical financials earnings. Our group median for implied\nfuture carry multiples of 8.5x is just under one standard deviation\naway from GS's historical P/E average of 9.5x. Although\nwe use the higher multiple, this is on a lower value of fully\ntaxed future performance fee earnings. The impact to valuation\nof future performance fees are mixed from company and\ncan be seen in greater detail in the following appendix with\ncompany specific SOTP and scenario analysis. While we\nexpect some multiple expansion for performance fees in a\nC-corp, the structure will not change the inherent volatility\nof the performance fee portion of earnings that is\nmarked to market.\nExhibit 28:\nUpside Scenario SOTP Valuation\n= B+C+D = G x H = E + F + I\nA B C D E F G H I J\nTicker\nCurrent\nPrice\n2018E\nCore FRE\nFRE\nMultiple\nCore FRE\nValue Per\nShare @\n24% tax\nRate\nAfter-Tax\nBDC\nValue Per\nShare\nBS NAV\nPer Share\nSOTP\nValue Ex-\nCarry Per\nShare\nAfter-Tax\nNet Carry\nReceivable\nPer Share\n@24% Rate\nNet Carry Per\nShare After 24%\nTax (Avg. 2018e-\n2020e)\nFuture\nCarry\nMultiple\nValue of\nFuture\nCarry\nTotal\nValue Per\nShare\n%\nIncrease\nfrom\nCurrent\nPrice\nAPO $36.42 669 22.5x $28.40 $0.00 $2.72 $31.13 $1.64 $1.86 7.1x $13.30 $46.07 26%\nARES $24.70 185 22.5x $14.71 $4.52 $0.69 $19.92 $0.78 $0.48 13.6x $6.47 $27.18 10%\nBX $36.78 1,196 22.5x $17.03 $0.00 $2.83 $19.86 $2.29 $1.57 11.5x $18.04 $40.18 9%\nCG $25.60 100 22.5x $5.01 $0.00 $0.85 $5.86 $4.40 $2.17 8.0x $17.26 $27.52 8%\nKKR $24.40 475 22.5x $9.57 $0.00 $9.71 $19.28 $1.32 $0.71 9.0x $6.42 $27.01 11%\nOAK $45.20 166 22.5x $18.17 $0.00 $15.19 $33.36 $4.38 $1.68 7.5x $12.58 $50.31 11%\nSource: Company data, Morgan Stanley Research estimates\nAverage 9.5x 13%\nMedian 8.5x 10%\nMORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH 19\nM\nM\nDownside Scenario\nOur downside scenario is fairly straightforward: We assume that\nalts convert to C-corps and pay full taxes on earnings but the current\np/e multiple does not re-rate upward at all. We assume the\nstocks trade at their current P/E, but on lower, fully taxed earnings.\nTherefore, our downside case for share prices is the same percentage\ndownside to EPS if alts earnings are fully taxed. While we do not\nbelieve there is a high probability of this happening, this does\nrepresent a worst case scenario for the names, in our view. On\naverage we see 18% potential downside for the group if this were to\nhappen. We then use a similar approach to deconstruct the SOTP and\nsee what the value for performance fees would be.\nl First, we determine the downside case share price by taking\nfully taxed 2018e EPS (at 24%) and multiplying by the current\n2018e P/E (the current P/E using our published EPS and current\npartnership tax structure).\nl In the SOTP, we assume that fee-related earnings multiples\ndo not re-rate at all in the downside scenario and that the\nmarket continues to pay 15x. We believe there is a floor here\nin FRE will maintain current value.\nl Similar to the upside case, we then fully tax effect the performance\nfee earnings and use a full 24% tax drag on the net\naccrued carry receivable balance and the future net carry per\nshare.\nl We then subtract out the value of the FRE, net accrued carry\nperformance fees (tax adjusted) and the balance sheet value\nfrom our downside case derived share price. This gives us our\ndownside case implied value of future carry.\nl Finally, we divide that implied future carry value by our\nfully taxed performance fee earnings (@24%) to arrive at\nour downside case implied value of future carry. On\naverage, our downside case implied future value of carry multiple\nis 5.6x, nearly 3 standard deviations away Goldman\nSachs FY2 P/E.\nExhibit 29:\nDownside Scenario SOTP Valuation\n= B+C+D H I\nA B C D E F G = I / G = J-F-E J\nTicker\nCurrent\nPrice\n2018E\nCore FRE\nFRE\nMultiple\nCore FRE\nValue Per\nShare @\n24% tax\nRate\nAfter-Tax\nBDC\nValue Per\nShare\nBS NAV\nPer Share\nSOTP\nValue Ex-\nCarry Per\nShare\nAfter-Tax\nNet Carry\nReceivable\nPer Share\n@24% Rate\nNet Carry Per\nShare After 24%\nTax (Avg.\n2018e-2020e)\nImplied\nFuture\nCarry\nMultiple\nValue of\nFuture\nCarry\nImplied\nTotal\nValue Per\nShare\n%\nIncrease\nfrom\nCurrent\nPrice\nAPO $36.42 669 15.0x $18.94 $0.00 $2.72 $21.66 $1.64 $1.86 4.2x $7.91 $31.20 -14%\nARES $24.70 185 15.0x $9.81 $3.01 $0.69 $13.51 $0.78 $0.48 7.7x $3.65 $17.95 -27%\nBX $36.78 1,196 15.0x $11.36 $0.00 $2.83 $14.19 $2.29 $1.57 8.3x $13.04 $29.51 -20%\nCG $25.60 100 15.0x $3.34 $0.00 $0.85 $4.19 $4.40 $2.17 6.9x $15.03 $23.62 -8%\nKKR $24.40 475 15.0x $6.38 $0.00 $9.71 $16.09 $1.32 $0.71 2.5x $1.80 $19.21 -21%\nOAK $45.20 166 15.0x $12.11 $0.00 $15.19 $27.30 $4.38 $1.68 4.0x $6.71 $38.39 -15%\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research estimates\nAverage 5.6x -18%\nMedian 5.6x -17%\n20\nM\nM\nAppendix A: Company Scenario Analysis\nIn the following tables, we flex the inputs in our SOTP\nvaluation methodology to take a look at the potential\nimpact at varying fee related earnings multiples and\nmultiples on future carry.

Our DCF (COE of 12–15%, free cash flow = distributable earnings and\nterminal growth rate = 4%) captures the long-term value of the business model, while the sum of the parts captures some\nof the shorter-term volatility. For our SOTP, we use 2019 “Core” FRE and apply a 18x-21x multiple; apply 12x multiple on\nBDC income share; use NPV to estimate future carry and apply discount rate to represent volatile nature of carry; 10%\nhaircut on accrued carry; 10% haircut on B/S assets.\nAPO.N\nApollo Global Management: We value APO using a sum-of-theparts,\nsupported by a DCF, and back into an implied target multiple\non next 3 years DE, and ENI. Our price target implies a 11.5x multiple\non 2019 EPS, reflecting a 25% premium to historical valuation of 9.2x\nthat’s warranted due accelerating growth in and mix shift toward\nsticky fee related earnings for which investors ascribe a higher multiple,\nand APO is entering their harvesting stage that will see portfolio\nmonetizations accelerate driving stronger cash earnings\ngeneration. Upside risks: Better FPAuM growth, capital deployment\naccelerates, better returns. Downside risks: Declining valuations\nreduce cash earnings (fewer exits or lower multiples); slower deployment;\nFunds V, VI and VII and ANRP remain in escrow, pressuring near\nterm cash earnings.\nARES.N\nAres: We value ARES using a sum-of-the-parts, supported by a DCF,\nand back into an implied target multiple on next 3 years DE, and ENI.\nOur PT represents a 10.8x PE multiple, slightly above the 3 year\naverage of 9.3x on improving cash earnings trajectory. Upside risk\nincludes better asset gathering, stronger investment performance\nand faster monetization of portfolio investments. Downside risk that\nstrong AUM baked into our model over the next several years will not\nmaterialize. ARCC concentration risk (a BDC which contributes 40%\nof mgmt fees / 29% of revenue), and harvesting delays if there’s an\nextended financial & capital markets pullback.\nBX.N\nBlackstone: We value BX using a sum-of-the-parts, supported by a\nDCF, and back into an implied target multiple on next 3 years DE and\nENI. Our PT represents a 12.6x PE multiple, above the 3 year average\nof 9.4x on expectations for accelerated growth in fee-related earnings\ngrowth, cash earnings growth and fundraising. Upside risks:\nStronger investment performance, faster monetization of portfolio\ncompanies, better asset growth through new initiatives. Downside\nrisks: Weakness in public markets and commercial real estate markets\npressure investment performance. Harvesting delays—An\nextended pull-back in financial and capital markets that delays harvesting\nof investments and dampens returns which lower cash earnings.\nCG.O\nCarlyle: We value CG using a blended sum-of-the-parts, supported\nby a DCF, and back into an implied target multiple on next 3 years DE\nand ENI. Our PT implies a 13.5x multiple on 2019 EPS, reflecting a 55%\npremium to historical valuation of 8.8x given resolution of legacy\nissues and accelerating fee related earnings and asset gathering\nmomentum that will support the multiple. We expect less volatile\nfinancial performance across all segments in our forward look, vs.\ngreater volatility in historicals driven legacy challenges. Upside risks\ninclude: Better investment performance, strong asset gathering and\nfaster monetization of portfolio companies. Downside risks include\nan extended pull-back in financial and capital mkts that delays harvesting\nof investments and dampens returns which lower cash earnings,\nand poor investment performance.\nKKR.N\nKKR: We value KKR using a 1.3x multiple on 2019 estimated book\nvalue and back into an implied target multiple on next 3 years DE and\nENI. Our price target is also supported by a sum-of-the-parts valuation.\nOur PT implies a 8.2x multiple on 2019 EPS, reflecting a 9% premium\nto historical valuation of 7.5x given improving fee related\nearnings trajectory. Upside risks include better investment performance,\ncompounding book value growth and faster asset gathering\nfrom newer initiatives. Downside risks include an extended pull-back\nin financial and capital markets that delays harvesting of investments\nand dampens returns which lower cash earnings and impairs significant\ninvestments held on balance.\nMORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH 31\nM\nM\nOAK.N\nOaktree: We value OAK using a sum-of-the-parts, supported by a\nDCF, and back into an implied target multiple on next 3 years DE and\nENI.

Upside risks include better investment performance,\nfaster monetization of portfolio investments, strong asset\ngathering from newer initiatives and inflection higher in fee related\nearnings. Risks include poor investment performance, an extended\npull-back in financial and capital markets that delays harvesting of\ninvestments and dampens returns which lower cash earnings.\nMorgan Stanley & Co.
