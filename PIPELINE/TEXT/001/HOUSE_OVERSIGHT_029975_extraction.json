    "full_text": "Date: Tuesday, January 20 2015 12:14 AM \nSubject: are they still bothering you/ if so what about \nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation©grnail.corn> \nTo: \nI have to hand it to ms I'm sure she deserves the pretty penny she has made for her effort. She has \ncertainly caught the imagination of a public hungry for salacious fiction. To suggest her story is anything other \nthan that, a fiction , is ludicrous. Presidents at dinner on caribean islands. ( clinton was never ever there, easy \nto confirm ). Sharing a bath with a Prince ( bathtub too small even for one adult ). sex slave being paid \nthousands of dollars. ( while at the exact same time, she was working as a hostess in a burger bar ). being \nlent out to a prime minister though this prime mininster, never out of sight of his massive security detail also \nnever visited the island„ sex on a small airplane with a famous lawyer while the other passengers must have \nbeen all looking out the window during the event . I would have thought that her fabrications were readilly \napparent , but now , being asked to deny what the press has termed her\" allegations \" is frankly silly. ok, to \nplay along I deny each and every allegation. The only person she didn't suggest she was forced to have sex \nwith , was Bilbo Baggins. , maybe its in the sequel. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
