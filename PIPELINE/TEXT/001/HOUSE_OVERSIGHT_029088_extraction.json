Just give me and N=1. \nRemember you asked me, what does self-knowledge have to do with anything—and here is a most intriguing \nexample. \nI will send you a joke shortly \nAll best \nbob \nplease note \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029088 \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
