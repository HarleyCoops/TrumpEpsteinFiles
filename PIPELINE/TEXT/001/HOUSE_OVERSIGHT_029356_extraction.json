This catch-22 is the inherent contradiction that underlies \ncapitalist theory and practice. \nEighty years after Lange and Keynes made their observations, con-\ntemporary economists are once again peering into the contradictory work-\nings of the capitalist system, unsure of how to make the market economy \nfunction without self-destructing in the wake of.new technologies that are \nspeeding society into a near zero marginal cost e. \nLawrence Summers, U.S. secretary of the treasury during President \nBill Clinton's administration and former president of Harvard University, \nand J. Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of Cal-\nifornia, Berkeley, revisited the capitalist dilemma in a joint paper delivered \nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's symposium, \"Economic Pol-\nicy for the Information Economy,\" in August 2001. This time, there was \nmuch more at stake as the new information technologies and the incipient \nInternet communication revolution were threatening to take the capitalist \nsystem to a near zero marginal cost reality in the coming decades. \n"
