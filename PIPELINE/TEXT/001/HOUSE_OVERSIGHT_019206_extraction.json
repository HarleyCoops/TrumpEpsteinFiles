    "full_text": "﻿Wall Street Journal, December 30, 2016\nThe Fable of Edward Snowden\nAs he seeks a pardon, the NSA thief has told multiple lies about what he stole and his\ndealings with Russian intelligence.\nEDWARD JAY EPSTEIN\nOf all the lies that Edward Snowden has told since his massive theft of secrets from the\nNational Security Agency and his journey to Russia via Hong Kong in 2013, none is\nmore provocative than the claim that he never intended to engage in espionage, and was\nonly a “whistleblower” seeking to expose the overreach of NSA’s information gathering.\nWith the clock ticking on Mr. Snowden’s chance of a pardon, now is a good time to\nreview what we have learned about his real mission.\nMr. Snowden’s theft of America’s most closely guarded communication secrets occurred\nin May 2013, according to the criminal complaint filed against him by federal prosecutors\nthe following month. At the time Mr. Snowden was a 29-year-old technologist working\nas an analyst-in-training for the consulting firm of Booz Allen Hamilton at the regional\nbase of the National Security Agency (NSA) in Oahu, Hawaii. On May 20, only some six\nweeks after his job there began, he failed to show up for work, emailing his supervisor\nthat he was at the hospital being tested for epilepsy.\nThis excuse was untrue. Mr. Snowden was not even in Hawaii. He was in Hong Kong.\nHe had flown there with a cache of secret data that he had stolen from the NSA.\nThis was not the only lie Mr. Snowden told. As became clear during my investigation\nover the past three years, nearly every element of the narrative Mr. Snowden has\nprovided, which reached its final iteration in Oliver Stone’s 2016 movie, “Snowden,” is\ndemonstrably false.\nThis narrative began soon after Mr. Snowden arrived in Hong Kong, where he arranged\nto meet with Laura Poitras, a Berlin-based documentary filmmaker, and Glenn\nGreenwald, a Brazil-based blogger for the Guardian. Both journalists were longtime\ncritics of NSA surveillance with whom Mr. Snowden (under the alias Citizen Four) had\nbeen in contact for four months.\nTo provide them with scoops discrediting NSA operations, Mr. Snowden culled several\nthousand documents out of his huge cache of stolen material, including two explosive\ndocuments he asked them to use in their initial stories. One was the now-famous secret\norder from America’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court requiring Verizon to\nturn over to the NSA its billing records for its phone users in the U.S. The other was an\nNSA slide presentation detailing its ability to intercept communications of non-American\nusers of the internet via a joint program with the FBI code-named Prism.\nThese documents were published in 2013 on June 5 and 6, followed by a video in which\nhe identified himself as the leaker and a whistleblower.\nAt the heart of Mr. Snowden’s narrative was his claim that while he may have\nincidentally “touched” other data in his search of NSA files, he took only documents that\nexposed the malfeasance of the NSA and gave all of them to journalists.\nYet even as Mr. Snowden’s narrative was taking hold in the public realm, a secret\ndamage assessment done by the NSA and Pentagon told a very different story. According\nto a unanimous report declassified on Dec. 22 by the House Permanent Select Committee\non Intelligence, the investigation showed that Mr. Snowden had “removed” (not merely\ntouched) 1.5 million documents. That huge number was based on, among other evidence,\nelectronic logs that recorded the selection, copying and moving of documents.\nThe number of purloined documents is more than what NSA officials were willing to say\nin 2013 about the removal of data, possibly because the House committee had the benefit\nof the Pentagon’s more-extensive investigation. But even just taking into account the\nmaterial that Mr. Snowden handed over to journalists, the December House report\nconcluded that he compromised “secrets that protect American troops overseas and\nsecrets that provide vital defenses against terrorists and nation-states.” These were, the\nreport said, “merely the tip of the iceberg.”\nThe Pentagon’s investigation during 2013 and 2014 employed hundreds of militaryintelligence\nofficers, working around the clock, to review all 1.5 million documents. Most\nhad nothing to do with domestic surveillance or whistle blowing. They were mainly\nmilitary secrets, as Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified\nbefore the House Armed Services Committee on March 6, 2014.\nIt was not the quantity of Mr. Snowden’s theft but the quality that was most telling. Mr.\nSnowden’s theft put documents at risk that could reveal the NSA’s Level 3 tool kit—a\nreference to documents containing the NSA’s most-important sources and methods. Since\nthe agency was created in 1952, Russia and other adversary nations had been trying to\npenetrate its Level-3 secrets without great success.\nYet it was precisely these secrets that Mr. Snowden changed jobs to steal. In an interview\nin Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post on June 15, 2013, he said he sought to work\non a Booz Allen contract at the CIA, even at a cut in pay, because it gave him access to\nsecret lists of computers that the NSA was tapping into around the world.\nHe evidently succeeded. In a 2014 interview with Vanity Fair, Richard Ledgett,the NSA\nexecutive who headed the damage-assessment team, described one lengthy document\ntaken by Mr. Snowden that, if it fell into the wrong hands, would provide a “road map” to\nwhat targets abroad the NSA was, and was not, covering. It contained the requests made\nby the 17 U.S. services in the so-called Intelligence Community for NSA interceptions\nabroad.\nOn June 23, less than two weeks after Mr. Snowden released the video that helped\npresent his narrative, he left Hong Kong and flew to Moscow, where he received\nprotection by the Russian government. In much of the media coverage that followed, the\nultimate destination of these stolen secrets was fogged over—if not totally obscured from\nthe public—by the unverified claims that Mr. Snowden was spoon feeding to handpicked\njournalists.\nIn his narrative, Mr. Snowden always claims that he was a conscientious “whistleblower”\nwho turned over all the stolen NSA material to journalists in Hong Kong. He has insisted\nhe had no intention of defecting to Russia but was on his way to Latin America when he\nwas trapped in Russia by the U.S. government in an attempt to demonize him.\nFor example, in October 2014, he told the editor of the Nation, “I’m in exile. My\ngovernment revoked my passport intentionally to leave me exiled” and “chose to keep me\nin Russia.” According to Mr. Snowden, the U.S. government accomplished this\nentrapment by suspending his passport while he was in midair after he departed Hong\nKong on June 23, thus forcing him into the hands of President Vladimir Putin’s regime.\nNone of this is true. The State Department invalidated Mr. Snowden’s passport while he\nwas still in Hong Kong, not after he left for Moscow on June 23. The “Consul General-\nHong Kong confirmed that Hong Kong authorities were notified that Mr. Snowden’s\npassport was revoked June 22,” according to the State Department’s senior watch officer,\nas reported by ABC news on June 23, 2013.\nMr. Snowden could not have been unaware of the government’s pursuit of him, since the\ncriminal complaint against him, which was filed June 14, had been headline news in\nHong Kong. That the U.S. acted against him while he was still in Hong Kong is of great\nimportance to the timeline because it points to the direct involvement of Aeroflot, an\nairline which the Russian government effectively controls. Aeroflot bypassed its normal\nprocedures to allow Mr. Snowden to board the Moscow flight—even though he had\nneither a valid passport nor a Russian visa, as his newly assigned lawyer, Anatoly\nKucherena,said at a press conference in Russia on July 12, 2013.\nBy falsely claiming his passport was invalidated after the plane departed Hong Kong—\ninstead of before he left—Mr. Snowden hoped to conceal this extraordinary waiver. The\nRussian government further revealed its helping hand, judging by a report in Russia’s\nIzvestia newspaper when, on arrival, Mr. Snowden was taken off the plane by a security\nteam in a “special operation.”\nNor was it any kind of accident. Vladimir Putin personally authorized this assistance after\nMr. Snowden met with Russian officials in Hong Kong, as Mr. Putin admitted in a\ntelevised press conference on Sept. 2, 2013.\nTo provide a smokescreen for Mr. Snowden’s escape from Hong Kong, WikiLeaks (an\norganization that the Obama administration asserted to be a tool of Russian intelligence\nafter the hacking of Democratic Party leaders’ email in 2016) booked a dozen or more\ndiversionary flight reservations to other destinations for Mr. Snowden.\nWikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange also dispatched Sarah Harrison, his deputy at\nWikiLeaks, to fly to Hong Kong to pay Mr. Snowden’s expenses and escort him to\nMoscow. In short, Mr. Snowden’s arrival in Moscow was neither accidental nor the work\nof the U.S. government.\nMr. Snowden’s own narrative asserts that he came to Russia not only empty-handed but\nwithout access to any of the stolen material. He wrote in Vanity Fair in 2014 that he had\ndestroyed all of it before arriving in Moscow—the very data that he went to such lengths\nto steal a few weeks earlier in Hawaii.\nAs it turns out, this claim is also untrue. It is belied by two Kremlin insiders who were in\na position to know what Mr. Snowden actually brought with him to Moscow. One of\nthem, Frants Klintsevich, was the first deputy chairman of the defense and security\ncommittee of the Duma (Russia’s parliament) at the time of Mr. Snowden’s defection.\n“Let’s be frank,” Mr. Klintsevich said in a taped interview with NPR in June 2016, “Mr.\nSnowden did share intelligence. This is what security services do.”\nThe other insider was Anatoly Kucherena, a well-connected Moscow lawyer and Mr.\nPutin’s friend. Mr. Kucherena served as the intermediary between Mr. Snowden and\nRussian authorities. On Sept. 23, 2013, Mr. Kucherena gave a long interview to Sophie\nShevardnadze, a journalist for Russia Today television.\nWhen Ms. Shevardnadze directly asked him if Mr. Snowden had given all the documents\nhe had taken from the NSA to journalists in Hong Kong, Mr. Kucherena said Mr.\nSnowden had only given “some” of the NSA’s documents in his possession to journalists\nin Hong Kong. “So he [Mr. Snowden] does have some materials that haven’t been made\npublic yet?” Ms. Shevardnadze asked. “Certainly,” Mr. Kucherena answered.\nThis disclosure filled in a crucial piece of the puzzle. It explained why NSA documents\nthat Mr. Snowden had copied, but had not given to the journalists in Hong Kong—such\nas the embarrassing revelation about the NSA targeting the cellphone of German\nChancellor Angela Merkel—continued to surface after Mr. Snowden arrived in Moscow,\nalong with NSA documents released via WikiLeaks.\nAs this was a critical discrepancy in Mr. Snowden’s narrative, I went to Moscow in\nOctober 2015 to see Mr. Kucherena. During our conversation, Mr. Kucherena confirmed\nthat his interview with Ms. Shevardnadze was accurate, and that Mr. Snowden had\nbrought secret material with him to Moscow.\nMr. Snowden’s narrative also includes the assertion that he was neither debriefed by nor\neven met with any Russian government official after he arrived in Moscow. This part of\nthe narrative runs counter to findings of U.S. intelligence. According to the House\nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence report, Mr. Snowden, since he arrived in\nMoscow, “has had, and continues to have, contact with Russian intelligence services.”\nThis finding is consistent with Russian debriefing practices, as described by the ex-KGB\nofficers with whom I spoke in Moscow\nMr. Snowden also publicly claimed in Moscow in December 2013 to have secrets in his\nhead, including “access to every target, every active operation. Full lists of them.” Could\nMr. Snowden’s Russian hosts ignore such an opportunity after Mr. Putin had authorized\nhis exfiltration to Moscow? Mr. Snowden, with no exit options, was in the palm of their\nhands. Under such circumstances, as Mr. Klintsevich pointed out in his June NPR\ninterview: “If there’s a possibility to get information, they [the Russian intelligence\nservices] will get it.”\nThe transfer of state secrets from Mr. Snowden to Russia did not occur in a vacuum. The\nintelligence war did not end with the termination of the Cold War; it shifted to\ncyberspace. Even if Russia could not match the NSA’s state-of-the-art sensors, computers\nand productive partnerships with the cipher services of Britain, Israel, Germany and other\nallies, it could nullify the U.S. agency’s edge by obtaining its sources and methods from\neven a single contractor with access to Level 3 documents.\nRussian intelligence uses a single umbrella term to cover anyone who delivers it secret\nintelligence. Whether a person acted out of idealistic motives, sold information for money\nor remained clueless of the role he or she played in the transfer of secrets—the provider\nof secret data is considered an “espionage source.” By any measure, it is a job description\nthat fits Mr. Snowden.\nMr. Epstein’s book, “How America Lost Its Secrets: Edward Snowden, the Man and the\nTheft,” will be published by Knopf in January.\nJournal Video: Investigative Journalist Edward Jay\nEpstein on Snowden;s Legend\n\n"
