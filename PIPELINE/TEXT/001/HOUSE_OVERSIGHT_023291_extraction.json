You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per \nyear. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, \na desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. \nboats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 \npage tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, \nhome mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead \nof less that 3 million dollars. \nI have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights \n. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised \nas one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I \nfear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those \nthings that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you \nwouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer \nmany of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art \npartnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning \nthat you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait. \nONE YEAR AGO \nFeb 17 2014 i wrote : \nWith regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong \ninclination is not to be involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall many \nthat will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people \ninvolved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my \ninvolvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the \ncomplexities who else can do it? problem. \nYour family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping , nitpicking with \nlittle direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would \nreport to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I \nprefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer \nbe transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) \nWith no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to \nthink through the problem creatively. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you \nmight find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but \nwould require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure \nwhat role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller \nstays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy \nGregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into \nconsideration. \nTODAY \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023292 \nWith your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she \ncontinued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each \ntime with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was \nhired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very \nnice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new \nstaff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying \" but Leon \nsaid \" or\" its on Leon's desk etc\" , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her \nobfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I \nwas hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by \nme„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the \nweeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation \n,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating \ndown my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was \npartially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide \nyou the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my \nguidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your \nTom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. \nIn order to move forward \nI would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention \nand my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you \nare my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will \nhave this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind \nthat though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final \npayment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every \ncall Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was \nforced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions \nlast year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no \ncircumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which \nwas a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you \nfound yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took \nextra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my \nvery close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear \nof your own design ) \nI heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art \npartnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( \nFYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you \nrequired that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was \nnever to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should \nmake clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I \npointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said \nyou preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion \nof my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of \nour agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. \nHowever, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the \nrequired work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. \nshare moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route . \nalways. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. \nWe are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023293 \nDate: Wed, Nov 4, 2015 at 4:45 AM \nSubject: \nTo: Melanie Spinella \nokay, its time for you to decide how you would like to move forward. ( fyi get your money from the \n1031 . the screw up is only one of many,) If you decide to move foward on decanting. phaidon, note basis \nestate update , each requires many carefully orchestrated detailed steps. and precision. there are hundreds of \nmillions in saving if done correctly and a huge mess if not. If you want me and my colleagues to do it, \noversee it paper it and guide it, you should tell me. It is a big undertaking. If not, ok .. Brad and your crew \ncan do it. I will have no real further involvement apart from confirming the outcome of my proposed \nstructure, I will not risk the admonition of- they thought you said, they thought you meant, they understood it \nto be. but they said you said, ( i e ,I asked at our meeting that accounting be done properly for bens house, \nwhat came back was ada thought that I meant that we needed to go back to the 97 trust and give him a full third \nparty accounting of where his money had gone??!!

Hal erin' Ada Clapp \nJoe Avantario \nJeffrey-given the high daily interest cost (50k+/-) on $$ borrowed which you pointed out yesterday, here's what \nI'm thinking, but I want to be 100% on the same page as you: \n1. Close next monday on the credit line, but don't borrow any $$. (We can, of course push closing back but my \npreference wld be to close.) \n2. Right now, at barry's request, Irene Steiner, on behalf of the trustees is reviewing apol and apo-ol. While \nprobably not impt on a \"substantive\" basis it was (a) impt to barry and (b) is likely good for leon. \n3. We are hoping to have signature pages to the trustees (and returned to us) by early to mid next week. (Ada \nwill oversee.) \n4. We will then get the new trust to bofa who, moving quickly (according to them), will have an acct open the \nfollowing week, 12/7-9. \n5. We need to manage execution of paperwork associated with decanting which I assume occurs once apo-ol \nand bank acct are operative. (Ada I'm sure you'll be on top of this). \n6. I assume we will move $$ to pay down loan the day or day after (?) apo-01 bank acct open. As you know we \ncld do this as early as next monday/tuesday but then cash will be sitting in apo-1 while we're waiting for apo-01 \nbank acct. \n7. If there are sales of assets (or 'lc's) from leon to apol or apo-01 that needs to be buttoned down and \norganized asap. \n8.

Joslins answers were totally incomprehensible, the charts he \nprepared unreadable. Brads defensive posture was at a minum very surprising . He and I have recently gotten \nalong quite well, I thought. Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar number. no cash flow \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023296 \nafter weeks of requesting? odd. when you suggested that heathers behavior was emblematic of a sloppy \noffice , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay, admittedly no change for the year. . plane not \ndone. though it was the only thing i suggested doing first in july . . I sent you a list of 10 consultantts. brad said \nthree, . i didnt want to push it. I was shocked that brad was opining on things he knows little or nothing \nabout. tax issues. 1031. neg basis, note payoffs ( the same idea he said he had had from the beggining??!!) \n. answers re LBF holdings that can be corrected ( they cant) . valuations that have never been read. . When \nwe met in your lobby he seems surprised that i was there. I dont know if he felt somewhat sandbagged. . . \nthe savings on the note payoff is aprrox 33 % of 1.8 billion, real money if you do phaidon which i see no \nreason not to . if later josh and ben want to buy it back with you or without you they can. i will walk you \nthrough the structure one on one. . the losses will offeset the calder gain as well as apollo gain. \nIm aware that seeing what you saw frustrated you. I felt badly for you. \nYou wanted a contingent deal. real value. etc. I will not of course hold you to your deal . . its silly. its not \nhow i work or a reflection of our friendship, my proposal is as follows. I want away from your buisiness , but \nat the same time leaving you in good shape. I think you should pay the 25m that you did not for this \nyear. for next year its the same 40 m as always, paid 20 in jan and 20 in july, and then we are done. I will give \nyou advice and counsel but new people will be running your operating machine. I will oversee all the work \nthat needs to be done you and I will hire new people , and it will be self running. ( it was may in my house \nwhen you told brad it had been 5 months and you were getting fed up ) I will set up a parallel. office , somenoe \nlike wendy dolman or her quality is paramount. two accountants two bookeepers and two office \nadmins. . alan and zoe will handle trusts and grats. heatehr diana george will be incolved in art partnership. if \nyou want brad, analysts etc. and kids to do investments I have little to add in that regard ,except to be able to \naccount for things properly. I suggest that the kids must have skin in any deal. \nAlternatively , we can continue to focus on fun and let someone else do the things that you want done. and \nyou and I can kibbitz about it all. structures outcomes risk, museums. charity, ( joslins answer by the way \nwas I had asked how much charity was leon planining to give this year , ( the 2 m ) he didnt include your \nfoundation or the payment to me, or from debra and you??!! \nDate: Mon, Dec 7, 2015 at 5:39 PM \nSubject: Fee \nTo: Melanie Spinella .1_____________________________ \nAmount ?

I find the friction over fees , counterproductive, in an attempt to avoid it I had \nsuggested a multi year deal early on. you rejected it. I then suggested, and urged you to have an option at a \nfixed fee , you also rejected that .you wanted the fee payment only at the end I argued but ,conceded. I \nsuggested a structure that tom didn't like, you rejected it. 5 I suggest you make a fair proposal.- that i can \neither accept or reject. some payment up front this time is a requirement.

You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per \nyear. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, \na desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. \nboats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 \npage tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, \nhome mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead \nof less that 3 million dollars. \nI have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights \n. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised \nas one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I \nfear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those \nthings that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you \nwouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer \nmany of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art \npartnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning \nthat you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait. \nONE YEAR AGO \nFeb 17 2014 i wrote : \nWith regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong \ninclination is not to be involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall many \nthat will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people \ninvolved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my \ninvolvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the \ncomplexities who else can do it? problem. \nYour family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping , nitpicking with \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023299 \nlittle direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would \nreport to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I \nprefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer \nbe transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) \nWith no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to \nthink through the problem creatively. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you \nmight find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but \nwould require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure \nwhat role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller \nstays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy \nGregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into \nconsideration. \nTODAY \nWith your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she \ncontinued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each \ntime with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was \nhired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very \nnice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new \nstaff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying \" but Leon \nsaid \" or\" its on Leon's desk etc\" , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her \nobfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I \nwas hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by \nme„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the \nweeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation \n,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating \ndown my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was \npartially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide \nyou the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my \nguidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your \nTom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. \nIn order to move forward \nI would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention \nand my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you \nare my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will \nhave this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind \nthat though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final \npayment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every \ncall Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was \nforced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions \nlast year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no \ncircumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which \nwas a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you \nfound yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took \nextra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my \nvery close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear \nof your own design ) \nI heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art \npartnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( \nFYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023300 \nrequired that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was \nnever to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should \nmake clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I \npointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said \nyou preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion \nof my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of \nour agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. \nHowever, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the \nrequired work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. \nshare moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route . \nalways. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. \nWe are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning. \nDate: Fri, Dec 11, 2015 at 12:19 AM \nSubject: Re: Fw: sched \nTo: \" 'eevacation mail.com\" <j eevacation mail.com> \nCc: \nFrom: Brad Wechsler \nSent: Thursday, December 10, 2015 05:36 PM \nTo: jeevacation@gmail.com' <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nCc: \nJeffrey-joe tells me you want this to go live on 12/21.

I was not \nshown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between he and his so called\" \nadvisors\" however as he was out of the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get \nto spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - the \nlist I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a priority to get done after consulting with your \noffice still remains virtually undone. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023304 \nIT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off \nexercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants \nup the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without \nbrads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is \nrun roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. \nEileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is \nrampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out \nthey cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they \nsaid that is the question they get asked ! \" were they deducted \" not 2 is there a benefit\" !!

I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. \nAs your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive \nThe following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me \ni suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain \nthe paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you \nconsider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank \nloans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do \nwill, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid \nof Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more \nprotections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art \ndivision with children in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra \ndied today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads \nchosen advisor??!)

You asked me for my help. I told you multiple times \nthat i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I preferred to have no financial interactions. I dont have many \nfriends and didnt want money to interefer with our unique relationship. For five years you had the kind but \ngoofy Eileen Alexandersson managing your accounting, legal, investments, reporting, trusts etc. When I told \nyou in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed she was incompetent you admonished me for\" speaking out of \nboth sides of my mouth\" . With regard Brad Wechsler, there is no \" both sides. \". I have \nconsistantly maintained since day one that he was highly unsuited for the job. When you initially asked me to \nhelp convince him to take the role , promising him a postion to manage mirage investments I sent you a note \nsaying instead you should pay up and get first class people. I have reiterated the same message for over a year \nnow.. Brad, not me was tasked with hiring new people and as you wanted him to take ownership of the \nstaff,he conducted many interviews, you may recall that as late as may, you told him in my presence that he had \nhad six months and had not hired anyone. since then I have rectified errors in sales tax, use tax, income \ntax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of deductions. ,( last nov ) 11 million found in dormant accounts \nand 4 million in the drawer. errors in cash flow both personal and Phaidon. Oversight on new grats first at 22 \nand then at 19 that were done without my consulatation were resolved only as aresult of my intervention. . 600 \nmillion in after tax savings was just accomplished. \nWith Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his total and \nutter incompetence was brought clearly, front and center. He may be a step up from Eileen, but, if he is, \nthen it is certainly not by much, A major difference is that Eileen knew she was over her head. Brad struts his \nstupiditly whenever he gets a chance. \nA critical example. - Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of care \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023307 \nand attention to details and mechanics. with regard Phaidon I was not shown one single document, not \none.!! Brad wanted to keep it private between he, and his so called\" advisors\" however as he was out of the \noffice during the most important transaction of the year, I did get to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the \nsituation in your office is totally ludicrous - to summarize - the list I provided to Brad last December - \nof things I thought were a priority to get done - still remains in the whole unresolved. \nThe IT, is virtually untouched and is still in desperate need of a format - reporting flawed cumbersome and \ninaccurate . all done by hand as one -off exercises , when either you or brad ask for it - airplane: re structure, \n(my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants up the kazoo but nothing at all \ndone.( the office was told by Brad not to share the outside proposals with me - brad has no idea even as to \nwhat questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is bullshitted over by almost everyone in the office. a little \nman , using your power, to appear larger. Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is \na huge difference. bad info is rampant a simple emblematic example- 3 million in deductions Im told \nwere taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit \n) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they said that is the only real question you were \nfocused on ! \" were they deducted\" not 2 is there a benefit\" !! I asked for the balance sheet and P and L \nfor Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. \"sorry we never got one?\" though 9.8 \nmillion invested, no p&l, nothing!, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo fired after only 3 \nmonths., no clue. fyi artspace financials are also a total mess. ( no receivables ??). when i asked for a list of \nwhat got done and did not, i received the email from Brad basicailly mind you own business, so much was \npromised. !!! \nAs in your words probably your closest friend and in order to turn the page. I hope the following to \nbe constructive \nHere is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. \ni suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain \na paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed you re their importance. THe Phaidon transaction papered \nand structured as contemplated DOES NOT WORK, its as simple as that. DOES NOT !! I suggest again \nthat you re-do bank loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no \nlonger trustee. re- do will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for \nexecutor role. get rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed \nages. put more protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make \ndecisions. , decide art division with children in attendance. have fire drill done on estate. fill out \nestate returns as if you and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled \nout was his own. Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., A strategy of the use of art should be \nimplemented. . you have tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. . boat \nconsultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA, BRH , rationalize \ninvestments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. \ndeal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon \ndebt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound \nissues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate \ntolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, I still think you might consider a \nRothshcild bank transaction they have 150 b and a distribution network with no products , private \nbank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk \nabout Rowen request re Athene , complex 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?! \nthe facts as i see them \nin June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then only after weeks, when you \ndelayed any detailed discussion of money wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully \nunderstand ) . you unilaterally changed changed our agreement. . 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and \nout of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only a third. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and the \nartspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023308 \nsurprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I \nwill be properly compensated for my work when strategies are implemented. you may recall that \nyou appeared offended and said \" are you suggesting that i would go back on my word\" I said no , of course \nnot ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get \nunhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay \nI included in this letter the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out \nmy understanding of the compensation for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just \ncompleted. though the number was great it was clear. When it appeared that the details could now be worked \nout I was the first to say, it is too much money, however. \nFrom day zero I proposed to discount to 50 - 60 million the fair price of the transaction just completed. \nincluding Phaidon. . though this amount was already substantially less than our agreed and negotiated \nformula. - I was never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane, or \nan -in-kind payment were discussed ( ie including keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I \nprovided as you specifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that \ni was given access to.

Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question \nthat not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including any wayt \nto deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most basic review of your largest asset by far , the BRH \nagreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it \nwas 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they were wearing a brightly colored clown \nsuit., the payment associated with the deal was known .

( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and the art space investment will also lead to a write- off of \nanother 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i require most people to pay \ntheir advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I will be properly compensated for my work when \nstrategies are implemented. you may recall that you appeared offended and said \" are you suggesting that i \nwould go back on my word\" I said no , of course not! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is \nthat when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay. \nI include below the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out my \nunderstanding of the compensation agreed for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just \ncompleted.ie 600m When it appeared that the transcation would and could go foward I was the first to point \nout that our agreement would cost you too much money, therefore \nmore details \nFrom day one I proposed to discount our agreement to a 50 - 60 million range. An extremely fair price for \nall the transactions just completed. including Phaidon. - I was never told that this was out of range. in \nfact, alternative methods of payment. ie my plane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed ( \nie including keeping the 30m portion of the fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided, only because you \nspecifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given \naccess to. ( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. ( as i said more needed \non phaidon ) . I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best of light , \nthough it is beyond question that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever proposed a \nunique idea. (including any way to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most basic review of \nyour largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and stretch \nreality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they were \nwearing a clown suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated with the deal was known . It \nhad both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was \nprovided. then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for the group to follow You told \nme that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be paid, (and even that \nwas more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did \nbrad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it \nwould be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were \nnever consummated, i would not be owed a dime, however , the expected fee was known up front. , the \ndetailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the \ntransaction had even begun, had already been heavily discounted, out of friendship, . I believe the decision re \nonly paying 20 m has frankly, left me felling quite uneasy. and colors the view about the Athene or \nRothschild transaction. \nDate: Fri, Jan 29, 2016 at 2:39 PM \nSubj ect: \nTo: Melanie Spinella \nyou've agreed that \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023312 \nYour office is a multi billion dollar responsibility, your children will inherit it, in order to oversee their \nfinancial lives- I feel for you, truly ,but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has provided one bad \ndocument after another for over a year, no getting away from it,, bad cash flows no new IT, each time \nwith\" its gettting better\" no in fact -! its not. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is ludicrous. \nof course he didnt actually prepare the statements. - no ceo would ,- but over and over he presented them to \nyou and me , after, holding them back for his personal review multiple times and after multiple drafts. weeks \nof his editing, the consistant but \"inexplicable \"missing the obvious serious errors . ( gaming ) inaccuracies, \n( cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the simple answer is that at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like \nyou ,also give points for effort. )- ! an elegant art partnership gone fallow. ??!!I and its core reason to exist. \nnot used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why? no docs for decantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last \nnight, \" no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest \" . why wasn't Tom brought in, after 4 times of my incessant \nreminders i spoke to him , he knows little of either transaction except for over view, never saw pahidon \nanything except projections until yesterday ? ?and this after your clear admonition etc. re the trading \naccounts no activity, at all, \nBarry Cohen is great. more like him please . \nyou asked, - I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they were \nnever going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands ? Brad at its head . you can't as a \nceo, have an accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing altogether and not \nnotice, you and I saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper after only a cursory glance. He \ntold me he didnt know the details of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to pay less. no more than that, any \nother story is blather. its silly. Talk to richard yourself. \nre your estate.

However since novemebr, you chose to \ndo so by ignoring' our agreement re, phaidon,and your oft stated commitment to me of large payments for \nlarge value, ( 37 percent was our number ). chose to pay me a number picked by what appears to be only by \nwhim,- have yet to justify it except for telling me that you and Brad Karp talked.. . \nWhat should we do? the next two years in biz world appears to both you and I , very fragile.

I \ncalled you then texted you that i had thought more about it and changed my mind. The next day brad called \nand asked for my vote. I told him ,in no uncertain terms it is a no , I categorically vote no. I called \nyou . you came to see me. I said it was a bad idea. you said you were going to do it anyway , I said and \nfollowed up in writing IT IS A MISTAKE . and added Please don't come back to me with anything suggesting \notherwise , you and I should be clear I think it is wrong . A very strong NO. you of course can hire whomever \nyou like. \nearly on I told you I thought Tom remarkably careless . Eilleen goofy and your art lawyer not well informed to \nsay the least. you told me Tom was a senior partner. Eileen had headed the trading desk, and Ralph Lerner had \nto know what he was doing as he wrote the book. . I said I thought you deserved better ,should get better \npeople and no , I am not an HR person. yesterday you told me that the reason you have hired whomver you \ncould find was to avoid being dependent on me. a decision by far, not the best place to try to save money ) \nJoslin- who you say I hired. I neither found nor hired. With a two person given choice I approved joslin over \nsome woman that eileen preferred. against my repeated advice you and eileen decided the pay range at under \n300k. I told you at that time that I would personally pay the difference for a higher quality person, that was \nyears ago. I have sent over a hundred emails to you clearly saying he needs to be closely managed by \nbetter professionals. initially, that referred to Eillen and Ada.and after, brad. john etc. THere are \nmany emails each and every month from me, telling you , he is slipping failing cracking fragile. . crazy, nuts, \nheading towards incompetence. Unless YOU- TAKE ACTION! when I pressured him for accurate numbers, \nyou told him, to tell me, that he works for you and NOT for me. . When I continued to press for accuracy from \nyour office , you told me that they were now all afraid of me and i should let brad communicate any requests, ( \nyou now tell me \" we know what Brad is\"?). When I told you you office needs to be reviewed and changed you \ntold me i was being destructive rather than constructive, when i ultimately confronted joslin, in an attempt to \nprotect you, told him that his numbers were wildly inaccurate , you told me that i had caused his ultimate \nresignation and now have an affirmative obligation to fill in the resultant gap. \nI did give you a bad number, and apologized as soon as i realized it. an error that was an embarrassment for me \n, the fact that that the accurate number is still way below what you agreed to pay, has fallen by the \nwayside.( the preposterous argument that the end of year transaction was Alans idea , which you now know \nwas not true and that me not receiving Phaidon documents was unexplainable, was your justification \nthough, for non - full payment ) \nHopefully You will recall that when you initially asked for my help. I declined repeatedly with the \nadmonition that that having a financial arrangement is fraught with danger and could complitcate our \nfriendship (as you will be unhappy paying what you will view as a large sum. while choosing to ignore \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023316 \nthe financial benefits, ).

It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand your desire to \nmodifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me, just a bit more red., here let me show \nyou, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to maintain it. I \nvigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work. . you describe me as zeus, i describe it as artist and a \nreaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you have the right to paint \nover it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours. \nI was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review \"some things.\" brad told me \n,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was my idea \n. Having them review things without even asking for my input, or let alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I \nguess you wanted to save money. ? \nThe audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie \n. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there, joslin part \ntime, but relied on. joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance team, \naccounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money again \n?) its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible, it was the first thing on my list of things that were \nneeded to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of, though its prophylactic quality has been discussed \nover and over during the past three years. computers do not read Page Six. the women at the IRS do. ! you \nsaid your motivation in keeping this group of part timers was a consequence of the high cost of my \nartwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - now \nIf you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH \nassignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not progressed \nvery far ).

Unfortunatley for us both, the price for my \nworks has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad \nnumber when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectly clear. that \nyou have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work , but again its value exceeds \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023318 \nanything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please also remember that you and i \nagreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big transaction. \nOR, you can decide that brad , tom, and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they can \noversee your audits. they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought in but i \nwould be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story. \n-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make no \njudgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them. not my role I am always on your side \non the table.

( gaming ) inaccuracies, \n( cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the simple answer is that at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like \nyou ,also give points for effort. )- ! an elegant art partnership gone fallow. ??! !I and its core reason to exist. \nnot used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why? no docs for decantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last \nnight, \" no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest \" . why wasn't Tom brought in, after 4 times of my incessant \nreminders your admonition etc. the trading accounts ? \nBarry Cohen is great. more like him please . \nyou asked, - I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they were \nnever going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands ? Brad at its head . you can't as a \nceo, have an accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing altogether and not \nnotice, you and I saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper after only a cursory glance. He \ntold me he didnt know the details of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to pay less. no more than that, any \nother story is blather. its silly. Talk to richard yourself. \nre your estate. Yes another Brad issue - your will, needs revision, the tenants in common structure I assume \nAlan has carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the more serious \nissues in an email but we can speak over the weekend. \nHow can I help? We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him, I would bear no \nresponsibility \nDate: Thu, May 12, 2016 at 6:17 AM \nSubject: tight schedule lets try a set time to speak \nTo: Melanie Spinella______________________________ \nLeon, you hired me to produce a work of art. it was not inexpensive, the value far exceeds any other piece in \nyour collection.- by FAR. It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand your desire to \nmodifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me, just a bit more red., here let me show \nyou, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to maintain it. I \nvigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work. . you describe me as zeus, i describe it as artist and a \nreaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you have the right to paint \nover it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours. \nI was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review \"some things.\" brad told me \n,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was my idea \n. Having them review things without even asking for my input, or let alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023325 \nguess you wanted to save money. ? \nThe audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie \n. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there, joslin part \ntime, but relied on. joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance team, \naccounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money again \n?) its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible, it was the first thing on my list of things that were \nneeded to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of, though its prophylactic quality has been discussed \nover and over during the past three years. computers do not read Page Six. the women at the IRS do. ! you \nsaid your motivation in keeping this group of part timers was a consequence of the high cost of my \nartwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - now \nIf you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH \nassignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not progressed \nvery far ). Lots of paper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside team will be brought \nin at my expense working for me and you. coming in for interviews and reviews, . sucession, technology, tax \nand compliance, investment reporting „ computerized timelines for filings etc. . household \nclassifcations and reporting with a system of best practices. \nMy goal is clear - to end, not extend, our financial interactions, you will have a machine that works , it \nwill not be complexto oversee , to create it, is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price for my \nworks has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad \nnumber when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectly clear. that \nyou have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work , but again its value exceeds \nanything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please also remember that you and i \nagreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big transaction. \nOR, you can decide that brad , tom, and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they can \noversee your audits . they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought in but i \nwould be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story. \n-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make no \njudgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them. not my role I am always on your side \non the table.

Remind me to talk to you about MR \nDate: Mon, Sep 19, 2016 at 8:56 PM \nSubject: \nTo: Melanie Spinella \ndec 2015 \nIT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off \nexercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants \nup the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without \nbrads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is \nrun roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. \nEileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is \nrampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out \nthey cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they \nsaid that is the question they get asked ! \" were they deducted \" not 2 is there a benefit\" !! I asked for the \nbalance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. \"sorry we never \ngot one?\" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo \nfired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. \nAs your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive \nThe following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. \ni suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023326 \nthe paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you \nconsider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank \nloans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do \nwill, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid \nof Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more \nprotections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art \ndivision with children in attendance. have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra \ndied today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads \nchosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common \nagreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. \n. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize \ninvestments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. \ndeal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon \ndebt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound \nissues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate \ntolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, Rothshcild bank, 150 b they have a \ndistribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK \nvisa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on \ntransaction. ?! \nthe facts as i see them \nin June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about \nthe issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the \nfuture ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and \nthe artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were \nsurprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I \nwill be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that \nyou appeared offended and said \" are you suggesting that i would go back on my word\" I said no , of course \nnot ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get \nunhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. \nFrom day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . \nthough this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was \nnever told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were \ndiscussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a \ndetailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not \nforthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a \ndiscount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one time in three \nyears has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and lets say he made \na contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they \nwere wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . It had both sent in \nwriting and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided. then and \nonly then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp \nthat only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I \nfeel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was \nnever told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to \nsend him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be \nowed a dime, however , the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and \noverseen by me, the price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had 'ready heavily \ndiscounted, out of friendship, from our agreement. I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly \nleft me felling quite uneasy. \nsince you asked since last nov. i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in eileens \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023327 \ndrawer.. went through cash flows for phaidon shwoing that john murphy is not an accountant. redid your \ngagosian contract , . organized structure in case of divorce, set up gift trust. stopped ada from including \nmultiple times things not in your interest, dealt with bad sales tax use tax income tax . created 8 millino in \ndeductions ,500k in mistakes , found bank of scotland fbar problems, . . reorg bad art purchases , funds taken„ \ncharibale decustions , helped with fincnacil sttment gamoing commions fling. . boat deductions, rescued stock \nfrom grats.. may 1 after months of brad not finding anyone i sent an email saying you would have to pay \nmore. . on april 15.

When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before \nhim. what would you like me to tell Barry? \nThere is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i \noutlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you \nlike ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a \nlong time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and \nTom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2 \npeople. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get \nhim ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, He complained for over a year, re his \ndirection by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of \nwarnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told \nyou he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for \nme and that brad needs to pays him . \n. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : \nI have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up \nquestions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) but \nsomehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you \nbellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect \nyou from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out \nthat he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really \ndangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said, I take no \nresponsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that was my opinion \nwas only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he \ntoo is still there, and a waste of money and space. \nMy time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign \nfunds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re \nmy time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and \nmake any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess. \nThat being said, the tasks at hand are the following. \nYou have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully \nunwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would \nbe much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I am \nconcerned re brad taking barrys place re )(XXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn \nACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets. trust valuations, are all a part. Barry will need 2 months \nto just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed modifications., \na way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts, filing \nrequirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into \nnew plan. . \"\" planning. art partnership engagement.. , airplane re-do. , buying another. . ? boat \nsale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years over due. . an accounting system. fire john \n.. joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and. except for heather everyone should be replaced with \nnew. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize, cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023330 \nsales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you \nCANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. . CANNOT!!! this will be very detailed work. . a self \ninflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit. or contain it. . . you will need \n3 new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you \nknow. He will need to be trained. note \n; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin,: im glad \nthat you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the fact that after \nonly one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more. \nI expect as a friend you will understand that \nI will no longer, not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long \noverdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul \nweiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin„ no one. needs to end. . you and I had \npreviously agreed no more of that, and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can \nnot say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you \nwont want to pay, so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge \nIf I can find the time to work, on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I hope \nyou understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as \nto avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with \nyou , I find it very distasteful. . so to be clear , my terms are as follows . I will only work for the usual 40 \nmillion per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every 2 months \nthereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin if i am able in January. I will immediately stop \nwork, if the payment is not received. If you want me to work this year until Jan 15 , it will be 10 \nmillion, paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a new estate plan a running office. staffed with \nprofessionals overseen by Barry. ( hallelujah ) a tax plan . and an investment that returns more than any \npainting you could possible own. . no agreement - no work. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the \nhour that i promised , and take your guidance as to what I should say. \nDate: Tue, Nov 29, 2016 at 1:27 AM \nSubject: so there is no misunderstanding \nTo: Melanie Spinella_________________________________ \nI have told the brads and barry,- I am done. its not a negotiation, out!! - fyi given my carlyn joslin \ncastrucci, admonishments,- though my involvement in those - in one instance only gave a name - in \nanother only given an eileen dictated choice btween two 250k preparers. and for castrucci, I actually sent \nemails that i take no responsiblity for his being hired. - however you felt strongly that I should be saddled \nwith their outcomes .even with brad wechsler, i again said two months in, Leon, he doesnt get it. I tell you \nthis so that you will understand that I will not interview, recommend or vet any new hire. \nA story - In 1993 trump and I had a friend that kept telling his pilots how to fly, and when to fly, he couldnt \nhelp himself from hiring morons as co pilots, and maintenance people based on cheapest rates. Donald and I \ntried and tried to talk some sense into him, to no avail. Donald and I were in aspen, sitting at little \nnells. when the friends plane crashed into the side of aspen mountain , klliing him and all on board,- Trump \nlooked at me and said without a blink , I guess NOW he wishes he would have listened to us.- a metaphor for \nyour office. . . had we not waited to the very last hour having had a six month window and tens of \nunasnwered text and emails re decisions needed including the 1031. you would have saved way more than \nyou often feel obliged to argue about. . silly but i reallize you are stressed. \nBarry will need to sit with brad for months, to absorb all the co's , structures. cash flow, financial statments \netc. I will present barry my thoughts on the overall redo , it will be the exact same email that i presented to \nyou and brad two years.ago . accurate numbers first. and foremost. . ( last week gaming report stil \nfunky). IT etc I pointed out some of the more glaring errors to barry to give him a flavor of what is to come. \nTuesday if you like we should discuss Giacometti , and pesner . difficult to finesse him if they are \nfiling documents that you won't. these ridiculous conversations with tons of people on the phone , removes \nany claim you might have to not be considered a WILLFUL NON-FILER. ( after youve been told by attnys \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023331 \nand pwc that you should file in writing , you have NO choice ) .. worst possible result - including \nserious penalties up the kazoo. \nDate: Tue, Feb 24, 2015 at 8:20 AM \nSubject: \nTo: Melanie Spinella - \nLeon, \nYesterday, I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and \nyou and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing \nthe things that I don;t have the time to do. \nIn order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, might be \nhelpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per \nyear. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, \na desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. \nboats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 \npage tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, \nhome mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead \nof less that 3 million dollars. \nI have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights \n. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised \nas one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I \nfear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those \nthings that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you \nwouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer \nmany of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art \npartnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning \nthat you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait. \nONE YEAR AGO \nFeb 17 2014 i wrote : \nWith regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong \ninclination is not to be involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall many \nthat will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people \ninvolved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my \ninvolvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the \ncomplexities who else can do it? problem. \nYour family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping , nitpicking with \nlittle direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would \nreport to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I \nprefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer \nbe transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) \nWith no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to \nthink through the problem creatively. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you \nmight find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but \nwould require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure \nwhat role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller \nstays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy \nGregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into \nconsideration. \nTODAY \nWith your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she \ncontinued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each \ntime with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023332 \nhired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very \nnice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new \nstaff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying \" but Leon \nsaid \" or\" its on Leon's desk etc\" , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her \nobfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I \nwas hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by \nme„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the \nweeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation \n,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating \ndown my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was \npartially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide \nyou the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my \nguidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your \nTom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. \nIn order to move forward \nI would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention \nand my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you \nare my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will \nhave this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind \nthat though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final \npayment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every \ncall Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was \nforced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions \nlast year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no \ncircumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which \nwas a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you \nfound yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took \nextra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my \nvery close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear \nof your own design ) \nI heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art \npartnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( \nFYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you \nrequired that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was \nnever to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should \nmake clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I \npointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said \nyou preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion \nof my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of \nour agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. \nHowever, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the \nrequired work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. \nshare moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route. \nalways. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. \nWe are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning. \nDate: Tue, Mar 21, 2017 at 6:58 PM \nSubject: Fwd: request for docs - AAP \nTo: Richard Kahn < \nnot for now. but maybe later , \n----------Forwarded message---------- \nFrom: Ada Clapp - \n>, Darren Indyke <IIP> \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023333 \nDate: Fri, Mar 17, 2017 at 10:45 AM \nSubject: RE: request for does - AAP \nTo: \"Barry J.

I was not \nshown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between he and his so called\" \nadvisors\" however as he was out of the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get \nto spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - the \nlist I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a priority to get done after consulting with your \noffice still remains virtually undone. \nIT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off \nexercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants \nup the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without \nbrads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is \nrun roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. \nEileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is \nrampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out \nthey cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they \nsaid that is the question they get asked ! \" were they deducted \" not 2 is there a benefit\" !! I asked for the \nbalance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. \"sorry we never \ngot one?\" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo \nfired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. \nAs your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023334 \nThe following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. \ni suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain \nthe paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you \nconsider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank \nloans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do \nwill, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid \nof Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more \nprotections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art \ndivision with children in attendance. have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra \ndied today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads \nchosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common \nagreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. \n. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize \ninvestments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. \ndeal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon \ndebt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound \nissues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate \ntolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, Rothshcild bank, 150 b they have a \ndistribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK \nvisa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on \ntransaction. ?! \nthe facts as i see them \nin June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about \nthe issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the \nfuture ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and \nthe artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were \nsurprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I \nwill be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that \nyou appeared offended and said \" are you suggesting that i would go back on my word\" I said no , of course \nnot ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get \nunhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. \nFrom day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . \nthough this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was \nnever told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were \ndiscussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a \ndetailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not \nforthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a \ndiscount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one time in three \nyears has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and lets say he made \na contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they \nwere wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . It had both sent in \nwriting and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided. then and \nonly then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp \nthat only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I \nfeel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was \nnever told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to \nsend him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be \nowed a dime, however , the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and \noverseen by me, the price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had 'ready heavily \ndiscounted, out of friendship, from our agreement. I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023335 \nleft me felling quite uneasy. \nsince you asked since last nov. i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in eileens \ndrawer.. went through cash flows for phaidon shwoing that john murphy is not an accountant. redid your \ngagosian contract , . organized structure in case of divorce, set up gift trust. stopped ada from including \nmultiple times things not in your interest, dealt with bad sales tax use tax income tax . created 8 millino in \ndeductions ,500k in mistakes , found bank of scotland fbar problems, . . reorg bad art purchases , funds taken„ \ncharibale decustions , helped with fincnacil sttment gamoing commions fling. . boat deductions, rescued stock \nfrom grats.. may 1 after months of brad not finding anyone i sent an email saying you would have to pay \nmore. . on april 15.

Joslins answers were totally incomprehensible, the charts he \nprepared unreadable. Brads defensive posture was at a minum very surprising . He and I have recently gotten \nalong quite well, I thought. Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar number. no cash flow \nafter weeks of requesting? odd. when you suggested that heathers behavior was emblematic of a sloppy \noffice , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay, admittedly no change for the year. . plane not \ndone. though it was the only thing i suggested doing first in july . . I sent you a list of 10 consultantts. brad said \nthree, . i didnt want to push it.

When \nwe met in your lobby he seems surprised that i was there. I dont know if he felt somewhat sandbagged. . . \nthe savings on the note payoff is aprrox 33 % of 1.8 billion, real money if you do phaidon which i see no \nreason not to . if later josh and ben want to buy it back with you or without you they can. i will walk you \nthrough the structure one on one. . the losses will offeset the calder gain as well as apollo gain. \nIm aware that seeing what you saw frustrated you.

I want away from your buisiness , but \nat the same time leaving you in good shape. I think you should pay the 25m that you did not for this \nyear. for next year its the same 40 m as always, paid 20 in jan and 20 in july, and then we are done.

I do not know how, and if ,to move forward - our last transaction. a transaction which you \nsaved 600 million in tax. even if 20 years away, ( i hope longer) even discounted is a 300 million \nsavings . for that you ignored our agreements , verbal written and emailed -and decided that it was only \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023338 \nworth 8 million dollars. ( assuming phaidon srichard happens. 24 m savings not including artspace and debt \nbenefits certain to come later ) FYI the phaidon transaction cannot happen as currently comtemplated IT \nwill not work . NOT \nWhen we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told you multiple times \nthat i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I preferred to have no financial interactions. I dont have many \nfriends and didnt want money in any way to interfere with our unique relationship. Reminder, For five years \nyou had the kind but goofy Eileen Alexandersson as the sole manager of your accounting, legal, investments. \nreporting, trusts etc. When I first told you in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed she was incompetent you \nadmonished me for\" speaking out of both sides of my mouth\" . With regard Brad Wechsler, there has never \nbeen a \" both sides. \". I have consistantly maintained since day one that he was highly unsuited for the \njob. When you initially asked me to help convince him to take the role , promising him a position to manage \nmirage investments I sent you a note saying that instead of hiring him you should pay up and get first class \npeople. I have reiterated the same message for over a year now. . Brad, not me ,was tasked with hiring new \npeople , according to his org chart.(nauseating ) and as you wanted him to take ownership of the staff,he \nconducted many interviews alone. . you may recall that as late as may, you told him in my presence that \nthough six months had passed he had not hired anyone. since then I have rectified errors in sales tax, use \ntax, income tax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of deductions missed errors of millions on the \nreturns. ,( april ) Oversight on new grats- first at 22 and then at 19 that were done without my consultation and \nneeded to be resolved soley as a result of my last minute intervention. . 600 million in after tax savings was \njust accomplished, though you left the 30 million outstanding that I had said should only be done\" if\" that was \nmy additional fee. not used for non biz purposes and not art. \nin June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout first projected at 20 . but less when \nartspace and debt taken out, - then only after weeks, when you delayed any detailed discussion of money \nwanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully understand ) . you unilaterally changed our \nagreement. . 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only a \nthird. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and the art space investment will also lead to a write- off of \nanother 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i require most people to pay \ntheir advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I will be properly compensated for my work when \nstrategies are implemented. you may recall that you appeared offended and said \" are you suggesting that i \nwould go back on my word\" I said no , of course not! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is \nthat when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay. \nI include below the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out my \nunderstanding of the compensation agreed for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just \ncompleted.ie 600m When it appeared that the transcation would and could go foward I was the first to point \nout that our agreement would cost you too much money, therefore \nFrom day one I proposed to discount our agreement to a 50 - 60 million range. An extremely fair price for \nall the transactions just completed. including Phaidon. - I was never told that this was out of range. in \nfact, alternative methods of payment. ie my plane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed ( \nie including keeping the 30m portion of the fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided, only because you \nspecifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given \naccess to. ( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. ( as i said more needed \non phaidon ) . I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best of light , \nthough it is beyond question that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever proposed a \nunique idea. (including any way to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most basic review of \nyour largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and stretch \nreality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they were \nwearing a clown suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated with the deal was known . It \nhad both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was \nprovided. then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for the group to follow You told \nme that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be paid, (and even that \nwas more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did \nbrad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023339 \nwould be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were \nnever consummated, i would not be owed a dime, however , the expected fee was known up front. , the \ndetailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the \ntransaction had even begun, had already been heavily discounted, out of friendship, . I believe the decision re \nonly paying 20 m has frankly, left me felling quite uneasy. and colors the view about the Athene or \nRothschild transaction. \nDate: Sun, Mar 20, 2016 at 11:17 PM \nSubject: \nTo: Melanie Spinella \nglad to see you are personally on the mend - as well as the fence. -- As you know i dread money \ndiscussions with you-- however -we should address the issue of what you would like to do moving forward. re-\ndo family office, accounting trusts , estate and apollo agreements .

When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before \nhim. what would you like me to tell Barry? \nThere is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i \noutlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you \nlike ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a \nlong time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and \nTom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2 \npeople. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get \nhim ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, He complained for over a year, re his \ndirection by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of \nwarnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told \nyou he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for \nme and that brad needs to pays him . \n. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : \nI have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up \nquestions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) but \nsomehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you \nbellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect \nyou from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out \nthat he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really \ndangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said, I take no \nresponsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that was my opinion \nwas only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he \ntoo is still there, and a waste of money and space. \nMy time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign \nfunds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re \nmy time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and \nmake any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess. \nThat being said, the tasks at hand are the following. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023341 \nYou have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully \nunwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would \nbe much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I am \nconcerned re brad taking barrys place re )(XXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn \nACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets. trust valuations, are all a part. Barry will need 2 months \nto just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed modifications., \na way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts, filing \nrequirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into \nnew plan. . \"\" planning. art partnership engagement.. , airplane re-do. , buying another. . ? boat \nsale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years over due. . an accounting system. fire john \n.. joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and. except for heather everyone should be replaced with \nnew. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize, cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock \nsales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you \nCANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. . CANNOT!!! this will be very detailed work. . a self \ninflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit. or contain it. . . you will need \n3 new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you \nknow. He will need to be trained. note \n; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin,: im glad \nthat you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the fact that after \nonly one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more. \nI expect as a friend you will understand that \nI will no longer, not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long \noverdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul \nweiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin„ no one. needs to end. . you and I had \npreviously agreed no more of that, and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can \nnot say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you \nwont want to pay, so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge \nIf I can find the time to work, on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I hope \nyou understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as \nto avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with \nyou , I find it very distasteful. . so to be clear , my terms are as follows . I will only work for the usual 40 \nmillion per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every 2 months \nthereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin if i am able in January. I will immediately stop \nwork, if the payment is not received. If you want me to work this year until Jan 15 , it will be 10 \nmillion, paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a new estate plan a running office. staffed with \nprofessionals overseen by Barry. ( hallelujah ) a tax plan . and an investment that returns more than any \npainting you could possible own. . no agreement - no work. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the \nhour that i promised , and take your guidance as to what I should say. \nher the last two places. ? \nTo: Melanie Spinella \nLeon please read the attached proposed response to the IRS , see if you can understand it !!!. lye asked for a \nre-do. and given prelimiary directions to Alan to have it edited over the weekend \n. If you are quarterbacking ,ok with me. just please let everyone know. you must deal with the outrageous \nincompetence in your family office.. Alans words \" but I was told that.. , but I was told by the office (sic) \nthat ... , BUT i was told by joslin,. , but I was told by. \" why is leon blaming me for ..\" . I ve have always \ngiven you my best advice, If you reflect on your financial life, you have been kept safe , had remarkable \nresults and no disasters. I have repeatedly urged you to get rid of the people in your office. , you \nhave repeatedly chosen to ignore my advice , you told me last week that the emotional reason was in order \nto be weaned off my group and not have to pay my high fees. ( though ignoring the benefit of between 1.5 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023342 \nand 2b to the better. ) . and no explosions. You have email after email ,where i remind you that I am not \nyour bookkeeper or accountant ( in brads corporate speak his\" finance dept ??!!) that it should be redone .I \nhave reviewed a multitude of the silly reports given to you and have pointed out the continued numerous \ninaccuracies . your question\" so what if the numbers are off, so what if the categories are off whats the big \ndeal??. I suggest you de risk you finances and make the tough decisions necessary - pay the right amounts ( \nhigh) to get the work done properly or , you are, Im afraid, certain to get an unhappy answer.. tom will be \nback from vacation, this week. \n----------Forwarded message---------- \nFrom: Halperin, Alan S  _ _ \nDate: Thu, Apr 28, 2016 at 5:16 PM \nSubject: Valuation Discount \nTo: \"jeffrey E.\" <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nI am attaching a draft response from Empire Valuation as to why it arrived at a valuation discount on the low \nend.

As you know, we have structured this agreement with \nthe Buyer as either Narrows Holdings LLC or AP Narrows LP, and given both of those entities the right to \nassign the agreement to any one among Leon, Debra, the kids, or family trusts including AP01 and AP02. \nGagosian wants us to agree that, if Narrows/AP Narrows assigns the agreement to someone else, Narrows/AP \nNarrows \"shall not be discharged from its liabilities under this Agreement and shall remain primarily liable to \nSeller.\" Larry is concerned that we might assign to the Black kids or to a trust that has no assets, and then when \nhe has to sue us because we don't make the final payment of the purchase price but have possession of the art, \nthe entity/person to which we have assigned the agreement has no money. \nI think this is a valid concern and that we should agree to it. \nHowever, Ada just reminded me that it is possible that Narrows/AP Narrows (really, Leon's) agreeing to \neffectively guarantee payment by the assignee might be considered a gift to the assignee. In the discussions \nwith Alan about rearranging the bank loan once AP Narrows is operational, Alan agreed that there could be \ndeemed to be a potential gift from Leon to AP01/AP02 if Leon provides a guarantee to the bank that is for the \nbenefit of the trusts as partners in AP Narrows. Alan suggested mitigating this risk by having the trusts sign \nside agreements with Leon which say that if AP Narrows defaults on the loan and the bank goes after Leon on \nhis guarantee, the trusts will make him whole. \nThis issue only arises if we assign the agreement. The risk is also limited in time because it would run from the \nmoment we assigned the agreement until the final payment is made, which even if we assigned immediately \nafter signing, would only be 11 1/2 months. \nShall I agree to Gagosian's request that Narrows/AP Narrows remain liable even if they assign the agreement? \nI'm in the office if you would like to discuss this, but I would love to get back to Gagosian ASAP so we can \nhave this agreement signed today. \nThanks, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023351 \nHeather \nDate: Mon, May 11, 2015 at 3:08 PM \nSubject: \nTo: Brad Wechsler \nRichard Joslin \nlets look at funding the art partnership begin with 100 m of unencumbered art. plus 20 inveestment. and the \nsame amoiunt of value from trust. leon should choose b trustee and begin to use mechanics. . later we can \namend and add. \n2 hire an IT person asap \n3.1 would hire jerry the woman. gittis. person \n4 .I will find a subpart k person to handle partnership acct \n5 , accounting software upgrade, onlilne banking needs to be seamless \n6. not sure status of bringing plane boat acct inhouse? \n7 prepare fbar report for june. draft next week \n8 pahidon actuals vs projections. . new valuation \n9. new valuation of tra contract? \njpm db goldman sachs acct? new Ilc? \nreview of dec 31 books for all entities? bfp . etc \nMelanie S inella \n, Ada Clapp \nDate: Wed, May 13, 2015 at 3:04 PM \nSubject: Fwd: jobs ahead \nTo: Melanie Spinella \nthe list that we discussed.. i spent time with brad again. re the candidates filing due, this week, next \nmonth,. \nDate: Sun, Dec 28, 2014 at 5:18 AM \nSubject: jobs ahead \nTo: Brad Wechsler Melanie Spinella \n, Ada Clapp \n1. review accounting system.

I said ok, but..... \" you told me to continue as we would work \nsomething out\" I told you my fee then was 40. feb you came with ben while kathy ruemmler was here. and \nsaid next week, debra got bad news. and I quickly prioritzed not adding stress to your situation. I wont \nregurgitate the interim, though millions of dollars were saved since. millions. . it is now one year later and you \npropose 10 mIllion , plus a contingent fee . I have said that i would work with you, and if contingent and a \npercentage of something. I strongly believe that is not in your interest. I continue to put our friendship first \nand dont want you to write a check for over 100million andthe i will have to listen to lewie for the next few \nyears. but if you prefer over my objection a percentage deal then it should be of all savings not just \nphaidon. ( a random concept) . The idea that i am somehow even marginally responsible for neither you nor \nheather, ever telling me that there was an unresolved issue, though you said you had been pinged a number of \ntimes is emblematic . \nI can do a call with you and Karp. anytime you like today, but i can assure you 100 percent that there is no \nlight between our positions.

START from total scratch. there is absolutely nothing worth keeping in \nyour family office except for heather, nothing at all . I remember when i bought my first house in order to \nrenovate and jack robertson said forget it. knock it down start again, I could n't believe it. but he was \nright. Like your tax returns that were done in triplicate. TOM RICH ALAN. . tom and rich were not really \nuseful in the end. Alan was the only smart one. you should in my opinion Start a brand new office. hire \ncfo. bring joe over, heather and samantha, run parallel for 6 months and close down the mess of elysium \nforever, leave your kids a functioning operation professionally constructed and managed. NOT BY ME!!! \nLAst nov i laid out priorities IT , being the first nothing as of today. in July I said focus on airplane as a test \n. to examine procedure and proficiency, so far mostly a waste of resources time people etc. Only last week \ntold debra owns 49 percent of plane. no IT to speak of. bens house unaccounted for. tax returns very \nvery sloppy, . boat still argued as third home. . pilots bonuses? , structure unkown by all. cash sitlling at the \nsame time loans outstanding. \nPhaidon, looks like close to breakeven in a few years. others totally unknown. Query, do you really want \nthis ? : I m not sure how you both want to have an investment office and have cash flow being eaten by \npublishing and loans amounts outstanding increased by art. --interest rates will be going up.- . your plane will \ncost 10 million to refinance - so will boat if sold next year-. art space and regan , both needs more cash. with \nlittle return, taxes , art purchases . Part of radical solutition is to sell publishing.altogether. (are the children \nreally interested.) . restrucuture plane from scratch. layers unncessary. simplify crazy structure s bank \naccounts trading accounts accounts payble. credit cards. etc. The best way to wean yourself away from me \nis to have someone else do the whole thing from scratch. . move brad to be the replacement for Richard. . he is \nnice but this is not what he does. Him saying it is s0000 fucked up to me , was only an echo of me sayint it to \nyou. \nSubj ect: \nTo: Melanie Spinella \nas brad can attest, I spent time today with joslin, joe. etc. no question at all, a failed experiment. In the \nwords of a banker that made a call on your office. what happened? leon seems to have replaced Eillenn with a \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023358 \nteam of Shleppers. ? I know you care little for what they may think , but the legacy you leave your kids is just \nthat. you only have 60 days of planning left for this year. numbers are all over the place. \nI recieved a nice call from Karp today, .

At the time, we discussed \nthe merits of using a gallery versus a commercial exchange agent and my recommendation to Leon was to use a \ngallery. I felt that there were advantages to using a commercial exchange agent instead of a gallery on the 1031 \nside (e.g., less likelihood of a breach of confidentiality, IRS familiarity with CDEC in the event of an audit, \nsecurity of funds), but that a commercial exchange agent gave us less comfort on the sales tax side. Leon did \nnot want to use a gallery because he was concerned about confidentiality and he did not want to have to ask a \ngallery that he did not do much business with to act as exchange agent. \nWhen Leon first discussed the exchange for the Cezannes with me a few weeks ago, I asked him if he wanted \nto use the same exchange agent as last year, or if he wanted to use a gallery. I said that a gallery carried little to \nno risk on the sales tax side, but I reminded him that he had not wanted to use a gallery last year for the Calder \nbecause of confidentiality reasons. He said to use the same exchange agent as before, which made sense to me \nbecause he was extremely concerned about confidentiality with the purchase of the Cezannes. \nI will find out about sales tax audits and will let you know. The exchange agent has had a New York resale \ncertificate since 2014 and has been engaged in art transactions like this since then, but I do not believe they \nhave been audited. I will check, though, and I will also ask the Herrick lawyer if any of his clients who have \ndone similar deals have been audited. \nBest, \nHeather \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
