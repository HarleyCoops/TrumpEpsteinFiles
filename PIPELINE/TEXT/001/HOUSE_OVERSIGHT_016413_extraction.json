[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nOpportunity Zones \nimage001.jpg; image002.jpg; image003.jpg; image004.jpg \nImportance: High \nHope all well, are you doing anything around these or clients? \nIn a former warehouse on a dimly lit street in the South Bronx, developers sipping Puerto \nRican moonshine listened as a local official urged them to capture a new U.S. tax break by \nrebuilding the decaying neighborhood. \nIn Alabama, a young lawyer quit his job after seeing the same tax break's potential to help \none of the nation's poorest states. He now spends his days driving his Hyundai from town \nto town, slideshow at the ready, hoping to connect investors with communities. \nAnd on a conference call with potential clients, a prominent hedge fund executive pitched \ninvestments in a boutique hotel in Oakland, which he described as San Francisco's \nBrooklyn. The project is eligible for the same tax break, designed to help the poor. \nBetting on Opportunity Zones \nSales of development sites are surging in areas eligible for tax breaks \nSource: Real Capital Analytics \nFervor about opportunity zones is heating up across the U.S. For a limited time, investors \nwho develop real estate or fund businesses in these areas are able to defer capital gains on \nprofits earned elsewhere and completely eliminate them on new investments in 8,700 low-\nincome census tracts. The goal is to reinvigorate these areas. But the question is whether \nthe 2017 tax law will, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicts, pump $100 \nbillion into places that need it most, or if investors will play it safe by funding projects in a \nfew zones already on the upswing. \nQuicktakeWill 'Opportunity Zones' Help the Rich, the Poor or Both?  \nThere's no lack of optimism among officials in shrinking Rust Belt towns, wind-swept \nWestern landscapes and hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, who hope to jump-start local \neconomies. The incentives are so flexible they could be used for everything from affordable \nhousing to solar farms. \nYet on the investor side, much of the attention is fixed on how to turn a profit in already \nthriving areas. They include neighborhoods surrounding Manhattan, Atlantic beach towns  \ndrawing vacation-home developers, bedroom communities near Silicon Valley and \nanomalies like Portland, Oregon, where the entire downtown was deemed eligible for the \nbreaks. \n\"The phrase I keep thinking of is 'gold rush,' \" said Michael Lortz, an accountant who \nworks with developers in Portland. \"There's a lot of money from out of town that's coming \nhere.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016413 \nAlready, a policy debate is raging. Backers are urging people to reserve judgment and say \nthe tax breaks have galvanized cities, businesses and investors to think creatively about \nboosting parts of the country most in need. Critics say the incentives were poorly \ncalibrated and may amount to a boondoggle far in excess of the official $1.6 billion \nprojected cost. \nAmericans may have to wait months or years to learn which side is right. That's because \nthe law doesn't require investors to disclose projects, making it difficult to tell which areas \nare benefiting the most. \nBut there's plenty of evidence that a boom is brewing. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which \nalready had an investment team focusing on struggling communities, has disclosed about \n$150 million in projects in recent months. Purchases of sites inside opportunity zones \nspiked as the tax law took effect, outpacing growth in other areas, according to Real \nCapital Analytics, which tracks property sales. Altogether, investors spent 62 percent more \non properties eligible for tax breaks in the 12 months through September, compared with \nthose in the same census tracts a year earlier, its data show. \nHere are snapshots of what's happening across America: \nBronx Boost \nPort Morris Distillery, which makes a high-alcohol rum called pitorro, was the perfect spot \nfor an opportunity zone pitch. It's on a block with a colorful mural, industrial buildings \nready for loft conversions and views of the Manhattan skyline. Much of the surrounding \nSouth Bronx is now an opportunity zone. \n\"We have always been the most ignored,\" Marlene Cintron, the borough's head of \neconomic development, told an audience of developers and lawyers in November. \"These \nopportunity zones are here for you to take advantage of them.\" \nThe case for the Bronx, where incomes are among the lowest in New York, is that it's the \nlast borough awaiting revitalization. The tax incentives are designed to unleash it. If \ndevelopers can buy at current Bronx prices, before seeing a Brooklyn-like rise, the breaks \nwould be massive. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016414 \nThe Bronx Tavern and Port Morris Distillery. \nPhotographer: David 'Dee' Delgado/Bloomberg \n\"Huge, huge upside that you're not going to get if you build a strip mall in Topeka,\" said \nTerri Adler, managing partner of law firm Duval & Stachenfeld LLP, who also spoke at the \nevent. \nYet the Bronx faces a formidable problem: It's competing with other zones across the city, \nincluding waterfronts in Brooklyn and Queens with stronger momentum. The tax break \nBronx officials hope will rejuvenate their borough may instead lure more money to what \nlooks like a safer bet across the river. \nIn November, Amazon.com Inc. selected Long Island City for its next headquarters. \nPortions of that Queens neighborhood, including a former plastics factory the retailer \nplans to occupy, are inside opportunity zones, even though they're among the city's fastest-\ngrowing areas. In 2017, more apartments were built there than in any other neighborhood \nin the city. \nDriving Alabama \nAlex Flachsbart, 30, has a lot of time to talk when he's in his SUV crisscrossing Alabama. A \nlawyer who specialized in economic development grants and tax breaks, he quit his job last \nyear to start Opportunity Alabama, aiming to connect capital to worthy projects. For the \npast several months, he's been educating people about opportunity zones, speaking to \nlocal officials, businesses and investors. \n\"I have done the OZ PowerPoint God knows how many times,\" Flachsbart, who grew up in \nthe Bay Area, said from behind the wheel one day in December. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016415 \nAlex Flachsbart gives a presentation on opportunity zones in Athens, Alabama. \nPhotographer: Nicole Craine/Bloomberg \nWhen he read about opportunity zones in a 2017 draft of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, his \nmind reeled. Here was an uncapped subsidy far more flexible than anything he'd used \nbefore. It could draw investment for an array of projects. He imagined funding startups in \nHuntsville, where NASA's presence has lured a deep bench of talented engineers, and the \nrenovation of an old civic complex in Mobile. \nFlachsbart's nonprofit—which has board members from the state's largest utility and its \nbiggest bank, Regions Financial Corp.—is now in talks for 10 potential projects that need \nmore than $loo million in equity investment, he said. None have been funded yet, but he's \ncertain some will be. Meanwhile, he keeps driving. \nBaltimore Billionaire \nOne of the arguments over opportunity zones is whether the U.S. is handing wealthy \ninvestors and companies big breaks on projects they would've done anyway. One example: \nHedge fund executive and former White House spokesman Anthony Scaramucci plans to \nbuild a \"swank, boutique hotel\" in Oakland. The paperwork for the permit was filed \nmonths before the neighborhood was designated an opportunity zone. \nBut that project pales in comparison to what's happening in Baltimore. More than a year \nbefore President Donald Trump signed the law, real estate developer Steven Siegel helped \nnegotiate one of the largest public financing deals of its kind for a client, a company owned \nby billionaire Kevin Plank, founder of athletic-wear maker Under Armour Inc.  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016416 \nPort Covington area of Baltimore. \nPhotographer: Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post via Getty Images \nIn 2016, Baltimore's city council approved a $660 million financing package for a 235-acre \nmixed-use development, including new offices for Under Armour, along the city's \nwaterfront. The area was already designated as an enterprise zone and a brownfield site, \nconnoting additional lucrative tax breaks, and the project attracted a $233 million \ninvestment from Goldman Sachs's urban investment group. \nThen came the opportunity zone designation. \nThe tax break is only supposed to apply to real estate purchased after the law took effect. \nBut lawyers across the country quickly began working around that to get the benefits for \nprojects planned before the law was passed. Many tax experts have recommended sales to \nnew entities. So long as the seller owns no more than 20 percent of the buyer, the \ntransaction counts as arm's-length and qualifies. \nSiegel said his firm, Weller Development, has found enough new investors to comply with \nthe arm's-length requirement. The company has seen so much demand, he said, that he's \nlooking to replicate the project elsewhere. \n\"We've been fielding a lot of inbound interest,\" Siegel said, declining to name cities that \nhave approached him. \"That stimulated us to take this show on the road.\" \nBoulder Balks \nIn mid-December, during a marathon city council meeting that stretched past midnight, \nBoulder became perhaps the first jurisdiction in the country to reject its own opportunity \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016417 \nzone. Officials in the Colorado town imposed an 18-month moratorium on almost all \ndevelopment in its only census tract earmarked for the incentives. \nThe move highlights how local officials have the power to respond to criticisms of the \nlaw—in this case, that investors may rush to build projects the community doesn't want. \nBoulder has long been a favorite spot for growing companies because people want to live \nthere, thanks to its college-town vibe and quick access to nature. \n\"People think we have too much\" development, said Bob Yates, a council member. \"We're \nnot Detroit.\" \nAn eyebrow salon is surrounded by empty stores at Diagonal Plaza in Boulder. \nPhotographer: Rachel Woolf/Bloomberg \nThough Yates, a former telecom executive, opposed the moratorium and worries it will \nmake things difficult for businesses in the zone, he understands why people in Boulder, a \nliberal enclave, were skeptical of an idea enacted by a Republican Congress. He just wishes \nhis city would take a more measured approach. \nThe zone includes an aging mall called Diagonal Plaza. The tax incentives could have \nspurred investors to redevelop it to include affordable housing, which is sorely needed, he \nsaid. \n\"Boulder's teachers can't live in Boulder,\" he said. \"It's not a healthy thing to have \nsocioeconomic divide where lower-income people have to live outside of town to serve \nhigher-income people in town.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016418 \nPaul V.
