Sometimes referred to as \"Brooklyn's Barack\", he is a staunch \nsupporter of President Obama and a progressive voice for the people of New York City. NY1 did a profile piece \nabout his work on the vitally important Budget and Judiciary committees in Washington. You can watch the  \nvideo here  or read the text below. \nHakeem is committed to electing a Democratic majority in 2014 and is encouraging his friends to participate in \nthe DCCC/DSCC fundraising dinner with President Obama this coming Monday night. Shoot us an email or \ngive us a call at (212) 531-2858 if you would like to get involved with the dinner, or would like to get an \nopportunity to get to know Hakeem better. He is an impressive guy and who will be a progressive voice in New \nYork politics for years to come. \nThanks, \nDarren Rigger, Lisa Rossi & Walter Swett \nDynamic SRG \nNY!: Hakeem Jeffries Positions Himself For Long Career In Washington \nApr 29, 2013 \nBy: Michael Scotto \nHakeem Jeffries is only about four months into his freshman year in Congress but he's already positioning \nhimself for a long career in Washington. NY 1 's Michael Scotto filed the following report. \nIf you're looking to knock Hakeem Jeffries off message, you won't get very far. \n\"There's a hip hop song, every day I'm hustling, and I kind of feel that way down here in Washington,\" Jeffries \nsaid. \"In a positive manner, of course.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029342 \nThe freshman congressman from Brooklyn and a sliver of Queens is an ambitious work horse who always \nappears to have his eye on the prize. \n\"I'll be shuffling back and forth between budget and judiciary for the better part of the morning, making sure we \ntime it correctly so that I'm able to ask questions in both situations,\" he said. \nHe's a big change from Congressman Ed Towns, who retired after holding the seat for 30 years. \nOn any given day, Jeffries is traveling through the Capitol, attending hearings on the Judiciary and Budget \ncommittees, two of the most prominent in the lower chamber. \nFor Jeffries, those two assignments allow him to serve as a counterweight to the Republican leadership and to \ntalk up the President, whom he and his district overwhelmingly support. \n\"My job, I believe, is to help the administration of Barack Obama help us back at home,\" Jeffries said. \nIn his first four months, Jeffries has championed himself as a progressive, introducing legislation to help student \nloan recipients and voting against a bill Friday to ease the impact of automatic spending cuts to the FAA \nbecause it didn't stop cuts to programs that are impacting the poor. \nIn the months and years ahead, Jeffries says there's plenty to do. \n\"There's no shortage of the people's business down in Washington, D.C. and that's why the job is one that is a \nserious endeavor,\" he said. \nA serious endeavor that is also very much on message. \nYou are subscribed to this mailing list as____________________________ Please click here to modify your message \npreferences or to unsubscribe from any future mailings.
