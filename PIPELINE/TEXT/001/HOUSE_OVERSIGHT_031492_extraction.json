Unbelievable. These guys just love the publicity - clinton, dershowitz, now Trump. First these \n\"friends\" act like anything but your friend once they get sued; then the next joker of a lawyer decides to join this \ncottage industry of suing you and hoping either you settle or the \"friend\" settles. \nSorry to see this. Good luck. \nDavid \nSent from AOL Mobile Mail \nGet the new AOL app: mail.mobile.aol.com \nOn Wednesday, July 6, 2016 jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nthx \nOn Wed, Jul 6, 2016 at 9:28 PM, <I____________________> wrote: \nJust read the Fox News piece today rehashing old stories.

Sorry to see it; but i am sure by now you can deal with it for what it is. \nI appreciate the call from Darren a few weeks ago and would have loved to have a fought a battle for the fellow \nat issue. But once he let me know the guy had been served and it was just a matter if defending a deposition, i \nsuggested that it might be a waste of money to have me handle that. I hope it worked out. I am more than \nhappy to get involved any time in any way i can help - and i would like to think i could help with what i bring \nto the table. I just did not feel in that circumstance that you did not need me adding to the milking of resources \nthat i am sure has been going on with lawyers for years. \nI would have felt differently if it were a matter if taking depositions or actually litigating a case. I would like \nto think that in that circumstance i could add value. If we ever meet, i will tell you a bit about depositions i \ntook not long ago of the leaders of the PFLP terrorist organization. That was my kind of setting. \nPlease know that i am here to help in any way i can with any case or just for advice if you think my help would \nbe meaningful. Your situation seems to me to raise the combination of friends you have been very good to \nusing all you gave them and then ditching you and sharks swarming when they smell blood and i don't like to \nsee either. \nI \"met\" you originally through a friend i like very much. I wish it had been earlier in time; but looking to the \npresent and future, you just let me know if you need me. \nTake care. \nDavid \nSent from AOL Mobile Mail \nGet the new AOL app: mail.mobile.aol.com \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031492 \nOn Saturday, May 14, 2016 jeffrey E. jeevacationAgmail.com> wrote: \nthanks, lets meet when i am back in june \nOn Fri, May 13, 2016 at 11:50 PM, <__________________> wrote: \nSorry to see they are still dragging your name through the press.

I am preparing a lawsuit against the Broward County Sheriff's Department. I am looking for \na good and trustworthy private investigator there who will not undercut me with the Sheriff's department because of \nties there, etc. I have a couple of candidates; but someone recently referred me to one in Davie, FL who this person \nsaid would fit the bill. \nWhen I went on the guy's website, however, I see that one of the things he apparently holds out as a highlight (it is on \nhis \"press\" page) is a series of stories about your case. I assume the guy was an investigator for the other side in the \ncivil case - the group that set you up. \nHis name is Mike Fisten and his company is Blueline Investigations. If he is someone who you encountered and he \nwas a bad guy or out to get you, I would not want to use him. Even though we don't really know each other, I very \nmuch liked you when we spoke and I would not want to give business to someone who had gone after you and you \nthink is a bad guy. If on the other hand, he was a decent guy just doing his job, perhaps it would be ok. I can't tell \nenough about it from his website. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031493 \nAny thoughts on the guy? \nMeanwhile, I hope all is going well for you now and I wish you a happy and healthy new year. \nDavid Schoen \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nTo: \nSent: Mon, Feb 22, 2010 5:09 pm \nSubject: Re: \nthe strange person is \nOn Mon, Feb 22, 2010 at 3:33 PM, ‹> wrote: \nAs terrible as the system is and has been to you, I have to tell you one encouraging thing. Last Friday I spoke on a \npanel in DC on the justice system. I was seated next to Justice Breyer and got to know him a bit. For what it is \nworth, he certainly seem to understand that the system is broken and I hear this more and more. Indeed, he made it \nvery clear that he thinks the sentencing system (which he helped form as a member of the Sentencing Commission) \nis broken and while you are past having to deal with that, I would like to think this raises some hope that the rest of \nthe system will improve if others in his position feel the same. \nTomorrow I go to Alabama to argue before the court of appeals regarding the constitutionality of Alabama's \nCommunity Notification Act, which the lower court struck down as unconstitutional already. Ultra right wing court \nand election year, so who knows; but these laws are so Draconian. \nI saw that the U.S. Attorney's office is appearing in your civil cases as well. Some strange folks in that \noffice. Anyway, I will look forward to talking and while all the judges are going to be tough, Judges Marra and \nJohnson so far have not been rubber stamps for government in my case and that means something. \nDavid \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
