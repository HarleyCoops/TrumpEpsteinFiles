Twenty five years ago, I had a friend with a peculiar way of responding to seeing things he didn’t like on TV: he\nwould throw White Castle hamburgers at the screen. I always thought this was a bad way to waste a good hamburger, but I had\none of those moments the other night when watching news reports on debt ceiling discussions. Media outlets have referred to\nPresident Reagan’s scolding of Congressional Republicans for delaying debt ceiling increases, and the 18 increases that took\nplace during his Presidency. The implication: reservations about raising the debt ceiling are as irresponsible now as they were\nthen. This is a disingenuous argument; in the 1980’s, the debt ceiling being debated was 50% of GDP, and had no\nbearing on the solvency of the United States. Today, the proposed increase raises the debt limit twice as high, measured\nrelative to GDP or government revenues. While a default is a very bad idea (deserving of a White Castle hurling of its own),\nunconstrained debt growth with no plan to slow it is bad as well. Some suggest we not worry about debt growth, since demand\nfrom foreign central banks and the Federal Reserve would keep yields in check. That logic is irresponsible at best. Debt limit\nlegislation is a rocky but healthy way for a democracy to decide whether mega-deficits are in the long-term public interest.\nDebtlimitdebate of the 80’s: an entirely differentdiscussion\nPercent\nMultiple\n110%\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\nReagan scolds\nCongressional\nRepublicans for not\nraising the debt\nceiling\nDebt limit to\nGDP\nDebt limit to\ngov. receipts\n20%\n1x\n1950 1956 1962 1968 1974 1980 1986 1992 1998 2004 2010\nSource: OMB, BEA, J.P.

By the end of the process, we’re still looking for deficit reduction of $3 trillion+\nover 10 years (relative to the CBO Alternative case in which there is no deficit reduction at all). However, Congress is running\nshort on time, and may have to do a smaller debt ceiling increase/deficit reduction first. For now, we wait to see the balance of\nspending cuts and revenue increases 1 will be agreed to. Last week’s Profiles in Courage piece walked through the history and\ndynamics of this process, so we won’t repeat that here. Here’s our take on what has been proposed so far, with the caveat\nthat many plans are not crystal clear what baseline they are using 2 , or what steps they recommend to get to that baseline first.\nWhat's on the menu?

The Peterson Foundation’s\nsampling of 6 policy groups shown below indicate that 5 of 6 recommend revenue increases compared to where we are today;\nthe Heritage Foundation’s “Woody Guthrie Memorial Budget Plan” is the only exception. What kind of revenue increases?\nRaising the top two brackets, which would affect joint filers with adjusted gross incomes above $212,300, would raise $450-\n$700 billion over 10 years (depending on whether you use OMB or CBO numbers). If they cannot agree to raise rates, another\noption (as in the Gang of Six plan) would be reductions in the deductibility of state and local taxes, sales taxes, mortgage\ninterest, etc. As this gets sorted out, let’s hope everyone recognizes that the US tax system is already progressive. As shown in\nthe chart below, effective Federal tax rates for low earners have dropped to zero over the last decade, even after including FICA\ntaxes. News reports that the US tax system is regressive make me want to throw hamburgers at the screen.\nRevenues and Spending as a % of GDP\nRevenues Spending\nFiscal year 2011 15.3% 24.1%\nFiscal years 1950-1969 17.5% 18.1%\nFiscal years 1970-2010 18.0% 20.8%\nEstimates for 2035:\nCBO alternative case 19.5% 33.9%\nAmerican Enterprise 19.9% 22.8%\nBipartisan Policy Center 23.1% 23.7%\nCenter for Am.

In exchange\nfor a modest amount of “private sector involvement”, Germany agreed to more generous financing terms for Greece, Ireland\nand Portugal, and an expanded role for the EU-IMF lending facility (see following page). What would the plan accomplish if\nimplemented? While Greek debt to GDP ratios would remain well over 125% of GDP (the IMF estimate for next year is a\nridiculous 170%), Greece’s near-term financing obligations would decline, due to debt buybacks, exchanges into long maturity\nbonds, and interest grace periods on new EU loans. More broadly, the plan also allows for money to be lent to countries before\nthey enter into an IMF program, for recapitalization of banks. All things considered, it’s the broadest defense of the\nMonetary Union so far. On paper, it even looks like a free ride for holders of Greek paper that don’t participate in the debt\nexchanges (they would be paid at par). So, what’s not to like? Well, there are still questions about Greece:\n• There’s a big difference between generous financing terms and generous economic terms. Greece must still meet an\nenormous 5%-6% primary budget surplus target (government revenues less spending, pre-interest) during a recession\n• Greece must execute on its asset sale targets, despite having little success or experience doing this in the past\n• Banks listed in the IIF document (the committee representing them) are under no binding legal obligation to participate in\nthe debt exchanges, and may turn out to own less Greek debt than currently believed. [Note: bank participation in the Latin\nBrady bond era was high, since at the time, banks held almost all the paper, and in the form of illiquid loans].\nThe big question: would Germany still live up to the deal if Greece missed deficit targets or assets sales, if bank participation\nwas too low, or if hedge funds (once referred to by the Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party as a “swarm of\nlocusts”) reaped large free rider windfalls? Ultimately, this is a political question. If “yes”, Germany will underwrite Greece\nno matter what; if “no”, then a broader, coercive Greek restructuring might follow in the not-so-distant future 3 .\n3 This could get complicated. If there is a need for further debt forgiveness for Greece, will policymakers find a way to “ring-fence” the\nbanks that participated in the first round, and impose losses just on the hold-outs? Will the EU tell banks that if they don’t participate, their\nolder bonds will not be eligible for financing at the ECB?\n2\nJuly 25, 2011\nTopics: US debt ceiling negotiations, a more ambitious European bailout plan (finally), and how large cap growth stocks\nand rising corporate profits are patiently waiting for both of them to end\nWhat the EU gave: an easing of lending conditions, and an expanded role for the EU lending facility (EFSF)\n* Another 109 bn for Greece, allowing the country to continue to pay off maturing debt (to those not participating in the exchanges)\n* Rate on new EU loans to Greece, Portugal and Ireland cut to 3.5%, maturities on new & old loans extended from 7.5 to 15-30 years\n* 10 year grace period on interest on new EU loans to Greece; the unpaid interest accumulates\n* EU loan facility has the ability to buy sovereign debt in the secondary markets, including a plan to purchase 40 bn of Greek debt\n(most likely including much of the Greek debt purchased by the ECB)\n* EU loan facility has the ability to lend to countries (even those not in an IMF program) to recapitalize their banks\n* Language (with no specifics) regarding the use of EU structural funds to boost growth in Greece\nWhat the EU gets: more austerity, Maastricht with teeth (?) and private sector involvement in Greek debt rollover\n* Legally binding national fiscal framework to be developed by end of 2012; fiscal deficits brought to 3% by 2013 at the latest\n* Private sector involvement in Greek debt rollover, committed in principle by 30 financial institutions listed in the document released\nby the Institute of International Finance; target participation rate of 90%; exchange appears to result in Selective Default credit rating\n* Voluntary participation options include exchanging existing debt into 15 or 30 year bond with AAA-guarantees of principal. Bonds\nexchanged at par will carry low coupons (4.25% effective), while bonds with higher coupons will be exchanged at a 20% discount\nSource: Eurozone draft proposal July 21, 2011, IIF press release July 21, 2011\nIn addition to execution risk in Greece, we are left with\n3 other concerns. First, while there’s enough in the EU-\nIMF lending facility 4 to deal with problems in Greece,\nPortugal and Ireland, if you include Spain, it gets tight\n(note: the chart excludes costs to recapitalize banks). If\nItaly or Belgium entered Europe’s Liquidity Hospital, a lot\nmore money might be needed from European parliaments\n(in one worst-case scenario, Alliance Bernstein estimates\nthat the EU lending facility would have to increase from\n440 bn to 1.7 trillion Euros, mostly from Germany). Italy\nfaces a multi-notch downgrade from Moody’s, which is\nnot going to help. As we discussed two weeks ago, Italy\nhas been a model citizen in terms of running low budget\ndeficits for 20 years, but still cannot escape the confines of\nits very large existing debt stock (120% of GDP).\nLimited capacity at the European Liquidity Hospital\nOfficial sector lending capacity vs sovereignfunding needs (including\ndeficits) through 2013 - Billions, EUR\n1,800\n1,600\n1,400\n1,200\n1,000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nIMF\nEFSF\nTotal lending\ncapacity\nGreece package\nEFSM\nGreece,\nPortugal, Ireland\nSpain\nPlus Spain\nBelgium\nItaly\nSpain\nPlus Italy and\nBelgium\nPossible sovereign borrowingneeds from official sources\nSource: AllianceBernstein, Public Filings.\nSecond, as shown below, Europe is now a two-speed economy, with the periphery stuck in neutral (industrial production is one\nproxy for this; there are others, such as unemployment, consumption, export shares, etc). If the idea behind the EU/IMF effort\nis that austerity will boost growth and lead these countries back to the public markets, there is very little momentum in this\ndirection. If the status quo in the periphery does not change, all the EU package does is allow the current approach\nmore time to fail.\nIndustrial production\nIndex, 100 = January 2007\n110\n105\n100\n95\n90\n85\n80\nGermany\nEurope\nPeriphery\n75\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nSource: INE, CSO, ISTAT, NSS, Eurostat, Bundesbank, J.P.

We are often told that Germans across both major parties are unflinching\nsupporters of the European project, and will do whatever it takes to prevent a break-up. The objections from members of the\nBundesbank are described as lonely voices of opposition that carry no weight 5 . But how large are the costs going to be?\nGerman politicians and voters may see current circumstances as exceptional, and that if they just agree to one more package, the\nproblem will go away. However, we are starting to see analyses of how costly a permanent transfer union may be for\nGermany. Bernard Connolly at Hamiltonian Advisors sent me a recent paper from the Centrum fur Europaische Politik 6 in\nFreiburg, which provides some clues. They see three alternatives for the deficit countries:\n• massive reduction in regulations and unit labor costs to regain competitiveness\n• exit from the EMU, re-introduction of national currencies\n• permanent transfer union from surplus countries to deficit ones\nOn the last option, they estimate a “creditworthiness gap” in European deficit countries of Eur 108 billion in 2010. The gap\nmeasures how much European deficit countries rely on capital inflows to fund consumption, rather than investment (which\ncontributes to future GDP). Germany’s share of the European surplus is around ¾, so let’s assume a pro-rata burden on\nGermany to maintain the transfer union. As a result, the theoretical economic cost could be 3.3% of German GDP every year,\nwhich as shown, gets close to some expensive episodes in German history. If German citizens were faced with costs this high,\nit could be a White Castle hamburger-throwing moment of national proportions.\nCost to German taxpayers of major events\nPercent of GDP, annual\n4.5%\n4.0%\n3.5%\n3.0%\n2.5%\n2.0%\n1.5%\n1.0%\n0.5%\n0.0%\nPeak Versailles\nreparations (1929)\nUnification (since\n1991)\nPotential cost of EMU\ntransfer union\nSource: Carl-Ludwig Holtfrerich, Halle Institute for Economic Research,\nZentrum fur Europaische Politik (Freiburg), J.P.

At a time when European equities are trading close to 2009 lows relative to earnings and book value, this package\ncould result in a relief rally for European equities, particularly banks. The chance of a disorderly default in 2011 has decreased\nmarkedly, and a process has been put in place to create more seamless transfers to areas (and banks) in need. But the size of the\ntransfer union fund is not big enough to allay all concerns, particularly with Spain and Italy growing at anemic levels, and there\nis execution risk in Greece.\nRecent bank stress tests conducted by the EU concluded that only Eur 2.5 billion of capital needs to be raised (70 to 80 billion\nsounds more reasonable to us). And in the package announced last week, the following Orwellian clause indicates how\nEuropean policymakers feel about rating agencies these days:\nPoint 15. We agree that reliance on external credit ratings in the EU regulatory framework should be\nreduced, taking into account the Commission's recent proposals in that direction, and we look forward to the\nCommission proposals on credit ratings agencies\nIn Europe, denial appears to be an essential ingredient to the process (See “Five Stages of Greece”, June 30, 2011). Last\nweek’s package is a bold step towards Federalization and the worst-case outcomes have been avoided (money market\nfailures, bank runs, etc), but markets will remain nervous about Europe.\n5 Bundesbank President Weidmann, in response to last week’s package: “By transferring significant risks to the support-giving countries and\ntheir taxpayers, the Euro area has taken a large step to socialising risks created by unsound government finances and macroeconomic\nproblems. This weakens the foundations of the fiscal self-responsibility that EMU is built on”.\n6 Centrum fur Europaische Politik, “Creditworthiness trends in European countries”, Lüder Gerken & Matthias Kullas, 2011\n4\nJuly 25, 2011\nTopics: US debt ceiling negotiations, a more ambitious European bailout plan (finally), and how large cap growth stocks\nand rising corporate profits are patiently waiting for both of them to end\nWhile we’re waiting: large cap growth stocks\nOne day, the melodramas around US and European sovereign debt will end. While we’re waiting, one of the asset classes that\nlooks attractive is large cap growth stocks. As shown below (for a universe of 300 U.S. large cap growth stocks that meet\ncertain earnings quality and stability factors), free cash flow relative to both revenues and stock prices looks good compared\nto the last four decades. This is where we believe investors should be adding exposure if they are underweight versus their\ndesired equity allocations. This is also an asset class where active management can still provide a lot of value; the dispersion of\nlarge cap growth managers is higher than large cap core, large cap value and international equity manager dispersion.\nQ2 earnings season in the US is off to a good start. Nearly\n30% of the S&P has reported, and results have generally been\npositive. Earnings are beating consensus estimates by almost\n4% (7.4% ex-financials), all ten sectors are beating on revenue\ntargets, and only 7% of companies are reporting belowconsensus\nearnings. Given earnings expectations for 2011 at\n$98.50, the S&P 500 is trading at a reasonable 13.5x forward\nmultiple. However, y/y earnings growth expectations appear\nto be flattening out for both 2011 and 2012 at around 11%-\n12%. While Q2 earnings are doing well so far, some company\nguidance for the remainder of the year has been below\nconsensus, which would be consistent with the recent batch of\nreports indicating a slowdown in manufacturing and service\nsector surveys.\nMichael Cembalest\nChief Investment Officer\nAttractive valuations for US large cap growth stocks\nPercent\n9%\n8%\n7%\nNominal free cash yield\n6%\n5%\n4%\n3%\n2%\n1%\n0%\n-1%\nPost-dividend free cash flow margin\n-2%\n'71 '74 '77 '80 '83 '86 '89 '92 '95 '98 '01 '04 '07 '10\nSource: Empirical Research Partners.\nCBO Congressional Budget Office\nOMB Office of Management and Budget\nEFSF European Financial Stability Facility\nFICA Federal Insurance Contributions Act\nEU European Union\nIMF International Monetary Fund\nIIF Institute of International Finance\nECB European Central Bank\nEMU European Monetary Union\nAMT Alternative Minimum Tax\nA White Castle hamburger is smaller than its competitors’ offerings, measuring 2.5 inches square.\nThe material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.
