Representing two alleged victims identified only as Jane Doe#3 and Jane \noe #4, Edwards filed a motion in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach that alleges well-known criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, \nere involved in Epstein's international sex ring. \n'There's absolutelyno kemel of truth to this story,\" said Dershowitz, who represented Epstein. \"I don't know this woman. I've never been inthe same place with her. She's made up \nhe whole story completely from whole cloth.\" \ndwards' motionrequests that his new clients jointhe case of two other alleged victims — identified as Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe#2 in courtrecords — who are attempting to use the \nme Victims' Rights Act to force the U.S. Department of Justice to prosecute Epstein for sex trafficking of children by fraud and use of interstate commerce to entice a minor to \nommit prostitution, among other offenses. \nwealthy Wall Streetmoney manager who had once attempted to purchase New York magazine, Epstein traveled the world in circles that included President Bill Clinton and \nusinessman Donald Trump. Despite his vast fortune and mansion in PalmBeach, Epstein kept a low profile and wasn't a regular inthe wealthy island's social scene. \nhe low profile vanished in 2005, when a woman contacted the Palm Beach police fearing that Epstein had molestedher 14-year-old daughter. The girl told detectives she'd been \nnvited to Epstein's mansion, where she was paid $300 after stripping to her underwear and massaging Epstein as he masturbated. Police then located a community college student \nwho gave a sworn statement that she had taken six girls, all betweenthe ages of 14 and 16, to Epstein. \nolice referred the case to the FBI. In September 2007, Dershowitz helped Epstein negotiate a then-secret non-prosecu on agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office, which deferred \no the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office for criminal charges, courtrecords show. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028921 \nLINKEDIN \nhttp://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami- dadeiarticle5342709.html Page 1 of 3 \nSalacious new chapter n Florida billionaire's sex scandal I The Miami Herald 1/2/15 6:11 PM \nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of solicitingprostitution with a minor and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. \nAfter his conviction, Epstein's story grew even more bizarre, with anonymous women accusinghim in federal court of conspiring with Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British \nmediabaron Robert Maxwell, to operate an international underage sex ring. \nEdwards, the Fort Lauderdale lawyer, and Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who now teaches law at the University of Utah, filed a Jane Doe lawsuit against the U.S. government in \nJuly 2008, alleging that Epstein had committed crimes against their clients, including sex trafficking of children by fraud. \nThe case, whichhas been pending for more than sixyears before U.S. District JudgeKenneth A. Marra, initially involved two women, identified as Jane Doe#1 and Jane Doe #2, who \nsaid they were sexually abused by Epstein and trafficked as minors. \nOn Dec.30, 2014, Edwards asked to have two new accusers added to the case —identified as Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4. \nJane Doe#3 alleges inthe court filing that Maxwell and Epstein kept her as a \"sex slave\" from 1999 through20002, when she escaped to an unspecified foreign country. \nEpstein forced Jane Doe#3, who was then a minor, to have sex with politically connected and wealthy people , the court filing alleges. \n\"Epstein's purpose in 'lending' Jane Doe [along with otheryoung girls] to such powerful people [was] to ingratiate himself with them for business, personal, political and financial \ngain, as well as to obtain blackmail information,\" the filing alleges. \nJane Doe#3 identifies one of the men she was forced to have sex with as Dershowitz, a former Harvard lawprofessorandhigh- profile criminal defense lawyer. \n\"Dershowitz was an eye-witnesstothe sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epste n's co-conspirators ,\" the filing alleges. \nDershowitz denied the claims, describing them as part of an extortionplot. He called the filing \"the sleaziest legal document I have ever seen.\" \n\"They manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was interested inmoney,\" Dershowitz said. \nDershowitz said he intends to file complaints against Edwards and Cassell. \"This is a disbarrable offense, and they will be disbarred,\" Dershowitz said. \"They will rue the day they ever \nmade this false charge againstme.\" \nKnowingly making defamatory statements in courtrecords can be grounds for disbarment. Jack Thompson, a Miami lawyer who campaigned against violent video games and the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028922 \ngroup 2 Live Crew, was disbarred forprofess onal misconduct that included making defamatory statements. \n\"We're not comment ngon the story beyond our legal pleading,\" Cassel said. \nIn the most recent court filing, Jane Doe #3 alleges that Epstein forced her to have sex with \"many otherpowerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful \nbusiness executives, foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and otherworld leaders.\" \nThe filing names Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, as one of those world leaders. \nThe Florida Center for Investigative Reporting is a nonprofit news organization supported by foundations and individual contributions.
