But I go it (they even now approved you - they needed to do a \nbackground check believe it or not! — as on that dinner will be president of Austria, Clinton etc) for two tickets — for you \nand your guest for a price that you do not need to buy a table (as they do not sell individual seats). \nGuy below is a good friend and he is a CEO of amFAR (amFAR has a joined dinner) — so he helped. \nThe nice thing about these tickets is that they are the most VIP. It includes reception, dinner, gala and after all party \naccess. \nI have the same ones (through Bill). \nI also got two additional for you but it turns out that they are not the same level so I reached to Kevin for help. \nThe price is 2,500Euro per ticket (this is very reduced price as I think the regular one for this is 15K and it is hard to get \nit). They will need an email from someone from your office and name a your guest asap. \nThe plan for for Vienna I am sending you with my next email! \nBoris \nFrom: Kevin Frost [mailto \nSent: Monday, May 07, 2012 6:39 AM \nTo: Boris Nikolic \nSubject: Tix for Jeffrey \nImportance: High \nBoris: \nHere is the information sheet for Jeffrey to buy tickets.

I hope you guys are all planning to attend the dinner as well. You can tell your friend Jeffrey that he \nshould buy the Mini car for me as a thank you. =) \nI'm getting in to Vienna on Friday afternoon.
