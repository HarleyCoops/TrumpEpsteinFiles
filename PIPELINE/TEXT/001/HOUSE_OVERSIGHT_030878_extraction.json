We finally got him to come over, no cameras ... He said he wanted to \ntalk to me first. And we talked to him for two hours.\" \nUltimately, Bannon decided not to go on camera, but the conversation had a seismic impact \non the finished film anyway. \n\"He said something very profound to us, and it changed us and it changed the course of the \nfilm,\" Moore said of Bannon. \"I asked him, 'How did you pull this [Trump's election] \noff?' And he said, 'It's a very easy answer. Our side, we go for the head wound. Your side, \nyou have pillow fights.'\" \nMoore continued, \"That so f—ked us up to hear him say that ... watching him smirk as he \nsaid it. As soon as he left, we decided to watch the film... and put the pillow fight filter.\" \nOne example Moore gave of a change to his film post-Bannon was a line about news \nnetworks being run by men, from \"most\" to \"all.\" \n\"It's amazing how we talk as liberals. We always want to be nice and maybe be fair,\" Moore \nexplained. \nThe film also jabs at the media, highlighting major newsmen who have turned out to be \npredators, including Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030878 \nA spy told us, \"Everyone in the theater hissed when Les Moonves' face came up on-screen.\" \nMoore also held a Q&A after the screening. \nThe movie's already premiered in Moore's hometown of Flint, Mich., and played the \nToronto International Film Festival. \nRichard Kahn \nHBRK Associates Inc. \n575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor \nNew York, NY 10022 \nTel \nFax \nCell \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030879 \n"
