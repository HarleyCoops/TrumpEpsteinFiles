The dilapidated 80,000-plus-square-foot hotel finally sold in a\nbankruptcy auction last month to a U.S. affiliate of the real estate investment firm\nLondon & Regional Properties for just shy of $40 million.\nTo add salt to the wound, Trump and Clinton were never on the project’s advisory\n1 of 10 6/26/19, 11:57 AM\nPalm House Robert Matthews EB-5 Clintons Trump Tony Bennett\nhttps://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/lost-paradise-at-th...\n! ! \" # $ %\nSOUTH FLORIDA NEW YORK LOS ANGELES CHICAGO NATIONAL TRI-STATE\n!

The South\nAtlantic Regional Center (SARC) and its director, Joseph Walsh Sr., were allegedly\nable to siphon nearly $9.5 million of the foreign investors’ money, according to a civil\ncomplaint filed by the SEC in federal court.\nTo date, Walsh has only been charged civilly. He was allegedly even found recently\ntrying to solicit other EB-5 investors for another hotel project in Miami Beach, per a\nlawsuit filed in Palm Beach County.\n“This is the most egregious fraud case I have ever seen,” said attorney David George,\nof George Gesten McDonald PLLC, who’s representing EB-5 investors in the Palm\nHouse lawsuit.\nRegional centers like SARC function as middlemen between\ndevelopers and their foreign investors. But despite the key role\nthey play in the EB-5 process, there’s minimal regulation over\nhow they operate and few safeguards to protect investors.\nThe current system, critics say, is a petri dish for fraud that\nallows bad actors to come and go — in many cases with no\ncriminal prosecutions. At the same time, lobbyists for the real\nestate industry have pushed to ensure these rules remain in place.\n“No one is watching the regional centers,” said Doug Litowitz, a Chicago attorney who\nwas not involved in the Palm House lawsuit but represents Chinese clients in other\n2 of 10 6/26/19, 11:57 AM\nPalm House Robert Matthews EB-5 Clintons Trump Tony Bennett\nhttps://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/lost-paradise-at-th...\n! ! \" # $ %\nSOUTH FLORIDA NEW YORK LOS ANGELES CHICAGO NATIONAL TRI-STATE\n!

There is no evidence of him completing these projects.\nInstead, his past dealings were mired in controversy and litigation, including another\nfailed condo-hotel project in Nantucket called the Point Breeze that was forced into\nbankruptcy in 2010.\nMatthews, who was raised in Massachusetts, moved to Connecticut in the mid-80s\nafter dropping out of college and started buying up apartments and commercial\nproperties in Waterbury. Locals there began drawing comparisons between Matthews\nand the fictional Jay Gatsby due to his ritzy parties and expensive tastes, according to\nthe Hartford Courant.\nHe owned a 108-foot yacht named the Bon Vivant and claimed to possess North\nCarolina’s original Bill of Rights, which had been stolen by a Union soldier in 1865\nand was recovered by the FBI just over 10 years ago. Adding to the Gatsby\ncomparisons, Matthews became close with Connecticut’s then-governor, John\nRowland, in the 90s.\nThe developer used his political connections to secure favorable contracts with the\nstate government, allowing him to purchase government-owned property, among\nother things, according to the New York Times. To return the favor, Matthews\nallegedly bought a condo in Washington, D.C., from Rowland through a straw buyer\nin 1997 for nearly 20 percent more than what the governor had originally paid.\nThe condo sale and other business dealings eventually led to a corruption\ninvestigation into Rowland. But Matthews was never charged. So, he headed to South\nFlorida where he first bought the historic Palm House — which needed substantial\nrepairs — in 2006. Then six years later, Matthews began soliciting EB-5 investors for\nwhat he called Palm Beach’s last opportunity to build a “five-star hotel.”\n3 of 10 6/26/19, 11:57 AM\nPalm House Robert Matthews EB-5 Clintons Trump Tony Bennett\nhttps://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/lost-paradise-at-th...\n! ! \" # $ %\nSOUTH FLORIDA NEW YORK LOS ANGELES CHICAGO NATIONAL TRI-STATE\n!

Other EB-5 projects, including Hudson Yards in New York, the\nlargest private real estate development in the country, were also able to take\nadvantage of similar demographics.\nWithout mentioning his past dealings in Connecticut or in Nantucket, Matthews\ntouted his wife Mia Matthews’ success as an actress, singer and star of the\nNickelodeon show “Every Witch Way” and CW’s “South Beach,” which lasted all of\none season. To further show off his connections and status in Palm Beach, he would\ntake EB-5 immigration agents from China to a Mar-a-Lago charity event to meet\nTrump and take picture with him, according to a complaint filed by EB-5 investors in\nPalm Beach County Court.\nThe developer’s investment pitch also failed to mention that it was actually his\nsecond time acquiring the Palm House. And there was no mention of the fact that\n4 of 10 6/26/19, 11:57 AM\nPalm House Robert Matthews EB-5 Clintons Trump Tony Bennett\nhttps://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/lost-paradise-at-th...\n! ! \" # $ %\nSOUTH FLORIDA NEW YORK LOS ANGELES CHICAGO NATIONAL TRI-STATE\n!

While it’s unclear how the\ntwo met, Walsh allegedly lent Matthews more than $5 million of the foreign investors’\nfunds to keep his Palm Beach mansion from being foreclosed on.\n(Click to enlarge)\nIn March 2014, Matthews sent Walsh an email to thank him for “saving [his] house,”\naccording to the SEC complaint.\nAs more developers turned to EB-5 for cheap financing after the financial crisis, more\nregional centers received approval from the USCIS. From late 2014 to June 2019, the\nnumber of regional centers in the U.S. jumped nearly 60 percent to 884, according to\nUSCIS. At the same time, close to 300 regional centers have been shuttered since\n2007.\nThat high failure rate among EB-5 regional centers stems from an approval process\n5 of 10 6/26/19, 11:57 AM\nPalm House Robert Matthews EB-5 Clintons Trump Tony Bennett\nhttps://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/lost-paradise-at-th...\n! ! \" # $ %\nSOUTH FLORIDA NEW YORK LOS ANGELES CHICAGO NATIONAL TRI-STATE\n!

How can you deter\nfraud when there is no way for anyone to do any due diligence?”\nA spokesperson for USCIS said the agency has a team of auditors that conduct\ncompliance reviews on regional centers and noted in an email to The Real Deal that it\n“does not release information on specific EB-5 applications, investors or related\nprojects due to [the Privacy Act] and other restrictions.”\n“USCIS takes any violation of the law seriously, and we will explore all actions\navailable to us to ensure the integrity of our immigration system,” the spokesperson\nadded. “Where instances of fraud are suspected or proven within the program, USCIS\ntakes appropriate measures to deal with any actors involved in the fraud, including\nterminating regional center designation.”\nRegional centers have come under scrutiny for their roles in these EB-5 frauds in\nrecent years.\nUSCIS shutdown Vermont’s sole EB-5 regional center last year on the heels of the\ncountry’s largest EB-5 fraud to date in the state’s so-called Northeast Kingdom.\nElsewhere, in Jupiter, Florida, Nicholas Mastroianni — who’s helped raise EB-5 funds\nfor the Kushner family’s real estate projects — was sued last October over his\nHarbourside Place development by nearly 80 Chinese investors who accused him of\ndefrauding them. Mastroianni has denied these charges.\nOne of the underlying problems is that regional center\n6 of 10 6/26/19, 11:57 AM\nPalm House Robert Matthews EB-5 Clintons Trump Tony Bennett\nhttps://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/lost-paradise-at-th...\n! ! \" # $ %\nSOUTH FLORIDA NEW YORK LOS ANGELES CHICAGO NATIONAL TRI-STATE\n!

In turn, regional centers do not have an obligation\nto protect investors’ money if a development project sours.\n“That’s where the weak link of the chain is — there is no real enforcement of the\nfiduciary rule to protect investors,” Latour added. “The regional center says, ‘Hey I’m\nnot responsible.’”\nThe USCIS spokesperson said the agency has terminated nearly 220 regional centers\nsince January 2017, due to evidence of foul play.\nBut U.S. legislators have continued to kick the EB-5 program down the road, giving it\nabout 20 short-term extensions with many lasting only six months. And industry\nlobbyists have aggressively pushed back against any reform. The EB-5 trade group\nInvest in the USA has spent nearly $1.8 million lobbying on the federal program’s\nbehalf since 2014, while the lobbying group for the Related Companies’ EB-5\nbusiness spent more than $500,000 in 2018 alone, according to the Center for\nResponsive Politics.\n“This is not unlike any other industry that can produce a toxic product like the opioid\nindustry or the tobacco industry,” Gibson said. “There is a powerful interest involved.\nThey don’t want any oversight. They don’t want information about their projects to\ncome public.”\nBlurry middlemen\nUnlike Matthews, whose background is well documented in local news, SARC’s Walsh\nremains something of a mystery.\nIn the Palm House EB-5 marketing brochures, the smiling gray-haired regional center\noperator claims to have a background in advertising and electrical engineering. He\nalso claims to have launched “several startup computer and graphics firms that he\nbrought to the public markets in the late 1990s and early 2000s.”\nWalsh could not be reached for comment through his lawyer.\n7 of 10 6/26/19, 11:57 AM\nPalm House Robert Matthews EB-5 Clintons Trump Tony Bennett\nhttps://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/lost-paradise-at-th...\n! ! \" # $ %\nSOUTH FLORIDA NEW YORK LOS ANGELES CHICAGO NATIONAL TRI-STATE\n!

George, the plaintiff attorney, said SARC’s founder is now either\nin Vietnam or Australia.\nWalsh’s success in getting foreign backers on board for the planned Palm House\nproject, according to the SEC’s complaint, was largely based on lies made to\nunsuspecting investors who believed the project carried minimal risk.\nIn bold font, one marketing brochure claimed that the EB-5 investor money would\nonly be used for 43 percent of the project’s total costs while the rest would be covered\nby a $29 million loan from a “reputable bank” and $22 million in equity from the\ndeveloper.\nNone of that was true.\nSARC also claimed the investors’ funds would be held in an escrow account at PNC\nBank until their green cards had been approved by USCIS and that the money\nwouldn’t be touched until then. Investors were even sent photos of a PNC account\n8 of 10 6/26/19, 11:57 AM\nPalm House Robert Matthews EB-5 Clintons Trump Tony Bennett\nhttps://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/lost-paradise-at-th...\n! ! \" # $ %\nSOUTH FLORIDA NEW YORK LOS ANGELES CHICAGO NATIONAL TRI-STATE\n!
