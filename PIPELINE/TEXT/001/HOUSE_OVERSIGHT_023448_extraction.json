There may be \nsomeone as good in New York, but i'll never tell you and you really have a heck of a seminar table there. \nWhen do we do Whitman's \"Song of Myself\" 1-15 Who else is reading with us? I'm ready. \nA few other follow ups: \nDavid and Brigid point out that reality tv doesn't cost anything because it is, as it sounds, very low budget. \nNo writing , no special expertise or knowledge or research , no archival footage , no copyright clearance , no \nactors, no travel beyond the one location, certainly no clinton or woody allen or justice elena kagan or \ndavid brooks or Lena Dunham or even Professor New. That said, I think If were hiring the crew id do it for \nless -- probably 1, 250,000 all in . But I haven't won 10 Emmys and David has . That has value too. As does \nWgbh . But I'll be more prepared for the next conversation and want to be much more prepared for \ntempleton, so thank you. \nI really liked Michael. I would like to send him some stuff, but in googling him I noticed that we have the \nsame birthday! May I have his email? \nYou are in! Yeay! Lets see what this may mean?
