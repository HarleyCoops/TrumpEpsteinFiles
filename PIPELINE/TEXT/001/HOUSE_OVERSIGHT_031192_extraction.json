They are covering up the Epstein ponzi crimes. The Lisa Twardeau book states that the FBI is violating the law \nwith this cover-up. \nThe book says President Obama told the Attorney General that Jeffrey Epstein was cooperating in an overseas banking crime, but \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031193 \nthe FBI can't arrest Epstein. These are all lies by the President of the United States. \nThe book says that President Obama lied to cover up his relationship with Larry Summers who is on Jeffrey Epstein's payroll. \nThe book could give reasons for the president to be impeached for obstruction of justice whereby the U.S. Attorney General will \nlearn everything that is in the Twardeau book. \nReaders, stay with this hot story that reveals that a cover-up in America is taking place. \nThe Richard Nixon story all over again is in the Lisa Twardeau book coming soon........ \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031194 \n"
