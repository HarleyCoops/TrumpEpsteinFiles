This is totally unedited and uncut footage, but we \nwould love the opportunity to turn it into something great. \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/cObnljj xeo0654g/uWZ6KBVbLS?preview=WoodyAllen+Basic+Clip+for+Viewing.mov  \nIf Woody Allen agrees to let us use the footage, he will be in distinguished company. To date, we have filmed \nconversations about poetry with dozens of distinguished Americans including: \nBill Clinton \nAl Gore \nJohn McCain \nMayor Rahm Emanuel \nMayor Tom Menino \nSupreme Court Justice Elena Kagan \nSir Mervyn King \nFormer Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers \nThe conversation would be part of a large multiplatform initiative that Harvard Professor Lisa New has under \nway to bring poetry into the mainstream, and, especially, into English Language Arts classrooms in the United \nStates and around the world. The initiative, Poetry in America, includes a HarvardX online course, a television \nseries we're creating with WGBH to be paired with PBS LearningMedia segments for the classroom, and, a \nseries of online professional development courses we're creating for ELA Middle and High School teachers and \nfor their students. \nLet us know if Woody Allen might be open to our sending another release form his way. Of course, if he's \ninterested in releasing the footage for only certain parts of our project, we're open to having a conversation \nabout that, too. \nThank you, and I hope to meet you soon. \nBest, Leah \nLeah Reis-Dennis \nPoetry in America  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028957 \n"
