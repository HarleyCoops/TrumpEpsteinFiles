Everything we see is a perspective…”\nAttributed to Marcus Aurelius\nInvestment Strategy Group | January 2017\nSharmin Mossavar-Rahmani\nChief Investment Officer\nInvestment Strategy Group\nGoldman Sachs\nBrett Nelson\nHead of Tactical Asset Allocation\nInvestment Strategy Group\nGoldman Sachs\nAdditional Contributors\nfrom the Investment\nStrategy Group:\nMatthew Weir\nManaging Director\nMaziar Minovi\nManaging Director\nAngel Ubide\nManaging Director\nFarshid Asl\nManaging Director\nMatheus Dibo\nVice President\nMary Catherine Rich\nVice President\nThis material represents the views of the Investment Strategy Group in the\nInvestment Management Division of Goldman Sachs. It is not a product of\nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research. The views and opinions expressed\nherein may differ from those expressed by other groups of Goldman Sachs.\n2017 OUTLOOK\nDear Clients,\nReaders of our previous Outlook publications may recall that this page typically\nsummarizes the key themes of our economic and financial market prospects for the\ncoming year. However, for 2017 we decided that a brief overview would not suffice,\ngiven the current environment of high market valuations, great policy uncertainty,\nsignificant geopolitical tensions and, in all likelihood, an unconventional US\npresidency.\nSince the trough of the global financial crisis, we have consistently emphasized US\npreeminence and maintained a strategic overweight to US equities relative to global\nmarket capitalization-weighted benchmarks. Tactically, we have had an overweight\nallocation to US equities and US high yield bonds from as early as mid-2008. Even\nwhen US equities became more expensive, we continued to recommend that clients\nstay fully invested at their strategic allocations. Indeed, we have reiterated that\nrecommendation in our past Outlook publications, client calls and Sunday Night\nInsight reports as many as 59 times since January 2010.\nBut now we have crossed into the 10th decile of valuations: US equities have been\nmore expensive than current levels only 10% of the time in the post-WWII period.\nYet we continue to recommend staying the course. We are duly aware that this\nrecommendation is long in the tooth, particularly given such high valuations and the\nunusually high level of policy uncertainty.\nPolicy uncertainty, both economic and political, abounds globally: uncertainty with\nrespect to Brexit (the how and when), upcoming elections in Germany and France\n(the who), transitional government in Italy (the how long followed by what) and new\nappointments to the Standing Committee in China and their significance (the who and\nwhat of any reform agenda), to name a few.\nWe are also facing rising geopolitical tensions that could trigger significant market\nvolatility. Tensions in the Middle East will not abate. Greater Russian involvement\nin that region is stabilizing in some respects and destabilizing in others. Further\nRussian incursions into Eastern Europe may elicit a more robust reaction from the\nWest. Terrorism could spread in the US and Europe as ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and\nthe Levant) loses territory in Iraq and Syria and foreign fighters return home. North\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n1\nKorea’s nuclear program and missile launches go unchecked. There is rising risk of\nmilitary incidents—or accidents—in the South China Sea and across the Taiwan Strait.\nChina is the most likely source of global economic shocks over the next two to\nthree years. The country’s leadership continues to prioritize imbalanced economic\ngrowth over structural reforms, thereby increasing debt at an unsustainable pace. Such\nincreases will eventually prove to be destabilizing.\nIn Donald Trump, the US has elected an unconventional president in many\nrespects, including his more US-centric approach to China. If China responds to,\nsay, imposition of US tariffs on imports of Chinese products by sharply devaluing\nthe renminbi, significant downside volatility and tighter global financial conditions\nwill follow.\nGiven already high US equity valuations, uncertain economic and political policy\nprospects and heightened geopolitical risks, readers may well ask why we continue to\nrecommend staying fully invested in US equities. Among the reasons:\n• Our eight-year US preeminence theme is intact and continues into its ninth year.\nAs Professor Jeremy Siegel of the University of Pennsylvania wrote 23 years ago in\nStocks for the Long Run 1 and recently repeated in a Wall Street Journal interview, 2\n“Stocks are the best long-run asset.” We refine that view by saying US equities are\nthe best long-run asset.\n• We think that the policy backdrop in the US will be particularly favorable for\nthe economy, with looser fiscal policy, relatively easy monetary policy and a less\nstringent regulatory environment. We expect US growth to continue through 2017.\n• We expect global growth to improve modestly, from 2.5% in 2016 to 2.9% in\n2017, with looser fiscal policy and still easy monetary policy in key countries.\n• And last but not least, we expect that while President-elect Trump’s initial policy\nmeasures with respect to tariffs and trade agreements risk jolting financial markets,\nas a self-described “deal maker” he will likely adjust and change course as necessary\nto achieve his desired results.\nWe may have a bumpy ride, but the US economy will not be derailed.\nOver the years, we have viewed the glass as half-full—if not full—when it comes\nto the US economy. Many others have seen the glass as half-empty, pointing out that\nproductivity growth has decreased, US labor demographics are less favorable and\ngovernment policies have been ineffective. While it is correct that productivity growth\nhas decreased and labor demographics are less favorable, it does not follow that the\nUS economy is in stagnation. Quite the reverse.\n2 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nWe should note that our conviction in US preeminence and US economic growth in\n2017 is greater than our conviction in the direction of the equity markets. Just as we\nwere appropriately humble about how much further equity markets could fall when\nwe published our 2009 Outlook, we are equally humble today about our financial\nmarket outlook given the significant uncertainties ahead.\nHere, we are reminded of Voltaire’s famous words: “Doubt is not an agreeable\ncondition, but certainty is an absurd one.” A client with a well-diversified portfolio\nthat is fully invested at its US equity allocation is generally well positioned for these\nuncertain and probably volatile times.\nWe hope our 2017 Outlook is helpful as you evaluate your portfolio allocations.\nWe also wish you a healthy, happy and productive 2017.\nThe Investment Strategy Group\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n3\n2017 OUTLOOK\nContents\nSECTION I\n6 Half Full\nWe continue to view the glass as half-full—if\nnot full—when it comes to the US economy.\n8 This Recovery in Context—An Update\n9 A Hangover from a Crisis\n10 Secular Stagnation: Unfavorable\nDemographics\n12 Secular Stagnation: Declining\nProductivity Growth\n14 Mismeasurement of GDP Statistics\n18 Poor Policies in Washington\n19 A Steady Onslaught of External Shocks\n20 In Summary\n20 One- and Five-Year Expected Total Returns\n24 Our Tactical Tilts\n25 The Risks to Our Outlook\n26 Pace of Federal Reserve Tightening\n27 Low Expectations of a US Recession\n28 Rising Influence of Populist Parties\nin the Eurozone\n29 Geopolitical Hot Spots Get Hotter\n30 Terrorism Escalates\n30 Cyberattacks Continue\n31 China Submerges Under Its Debt\nBurden and Capital Outflows\n33 US-China Relations Deteriorate\nUnder the Trump Administration\n35 Key Takeaways\nWe expect a favorable global economic and\npolicy backdrop in 2017, but there is no\nshortage of risks.

US equities have also exceeded\ntheir pre-crisis peaks of October 2007 and March\n2000 by 75% and 103%, respectively, on a total\nreturn basis. This bull market has exceeded all\nother bull markets but one in length and exceeded\nall but three in magnitude.\nUS economic growth has also exceeded that of\nmost other recoveries in length. This recovery is the\nfourth-longest recovery in the post-WWII period 3\nand if, as we expect, the US economy avoids a\nrecession in the first half of 2017, this recovery\nwill become the third-longest. While many critics\ncorrectly point out that it is the slowest recovery\nsince WWII, it has actually created more economic\ngrowth than some of the stronger recoveries\nthat lasted for shorter periods. On a cumulative\nbasis, this recovery ranks sixth out of the last 10\nrecoveries with respect to GDP growth. What this\nrecovery has lacked in strength, it has partially\nmade up for in length.\nThe slow but steady growth has also exceeded\nthat of all other major developed economies,\nand US GDP per capita has increased more than\nthe GDP per capita of any major developed or\nemerging market country.\nThis recovery has created over 15 million\njobs. The unemployment rate decreased from\na peak of 10.0% in October 2009 to 4.6% in\nNovember 2016 and is now below its long-term\naverage of 5.8%. Even the broader U6 measure,\nwhich adds the underemployed (such as parttime\nand discouraged workers) to the number of\nunemployed, has fallen from a peak of 17.1% to\n9.3%, and stands below its long-term average of\n10.6%. Unemployment claims are not only lower\nthan they were during pre-crisis troughs but also\nat their lowest since 1973; they are also the lowest\non record as a percentage of the labor force (see\nExhibit 1).\nAs a result of more robust employment, wages\nhave increased as well. Wage growth, as measured\nby the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank Wage Growth\nTracker (which, in our opinion, is a better gauge\nof the employment backdrop than average hourly\nExhibit 1: US Initial Unemployment Claims as a\nShare of the Labor Force\nClaims as a share of the labor force are at record lows.\nMonthly Average (%)\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n1967 1975 1983 1991 1999 2007 2015\nData through December 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream.\nExhibit 2: Corporate Profits as a Share of US GDP\nProfits have been higher than current levels only 17% of the\ntime since 1950.\n% of GDP\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\nCorporate Profits\nHistorical Average\n4\n1950 1956 1962 1968 1974 1980 1986 1992 1998 2004 2010 2016\nData through Q3 2016.\nNote: Showing US corporate profits with inventory valuation adjustment and capital consumption\nadjustment.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream.\nearnings, since it is not affected by the changing\ncomposition of the labor force as new entrants are\nhired at lower wages), has picked up from a low of\n1.6% year-over-year growth in May 2010 to a high\nof 3.9% in November 2016—just below the 4.4%\npeak of September 2007.

Even median household income,\nas measured by the US Census Bureau, rose in\n2015 at the fastest rate on record.\nIn the corporate sector, total profits of domestic\ncorporations as a percentage of GDP, as measured\nby the national income and product accounts\n(NIPA), are close to all-time highs. At 11.5% of\nGDP, profits not only are well above the historical\naverage of 9.6%, but have been higher than\ncurrent levels only 17% of the time since 1950, as\nshown in Exhibit 2.\nDespite these “glass half-full” facts, the\nannouncements of US decline that pervaded the\nairwaves in the depths of the global financial\ncrisis have persisted. We continue to be inundated\nwith analysis of “America’s relative decline,” 4\n“America’s slow-growth tailspin” and “sclerotic\ngrowth,” 5 “an economic in-tray full of problems” 6\nand, of course, “secular stagnation.” 7 Two books\npublished in 2016 that have received extensive\ncoverage epitomize the sentiment: Robert Gordon’s\nThe Rise and Fall of American Growth 8 and\nMarc Levinson’s An Extraordinary Time: The\nEnd of the Postwar Boom and the Return of the\nOrdinary Economy. 9\nSome of the images are equally telling. We\nwere struck by a recent image of the Statue of\nLiberty on its side that resembles a BusinessWeek\ncover of March 1979 with a tear trickling down\nLady Liberty’s face. Since WWII, the waning of US\npreeminence has been a topic of recurrent handwringing.\nWhether prompted by the flexing of\nSoviet muscle, most spectacularly with the launch\nof Sputnik in the 1950s; the civil rights upheavals\nand growing fallout from the Vietnam War in the\n1960s, the Arab oil embargo and the Watergate\nscandal of the 1970s, the rise of Japan in the 1980s\nor the rise of China in the 2000s, the declinists\nhave foretold the ebbing of American preeminence.\nTypical of the genre is a 2009 book provocatively\ntitled When China Rules the World 10 by British\ncolumnist Martin Jacques.\nYet, as we wrote in our 2011 Outlook: Stay\nthe Course, neither the global financial crisis nor\nthe rise of China will hinder what we described\nas “America’s structural resilience, fortitude\nand ingenuity” and remove the US from its\npreeminent perch.\nWhat explains our difference of opinion, which\nhas consistently underpinned our investment\nrecommendation for a greater allocation to US\nassets and for remaining invested at such high\nvaluations? Why do we believe that the US is on\na more solid footing both absolutely and relative\nto all other major countries in the world? Is it a\nmatter of perspective, analytical rigor, bias, review\nof longer economic history, or reliance on a big\ncadre of external experts in specialized fields?\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n7\nExhibit 3: Growth in US Real GDP Across Post-\nWWII Expansions\nIn this recovery, GDP has grown at half the average pace of\nprior expansions.\nExhibit 4: Change in US Household Leverage\nFollowing Recessions\nA large reduction in household debt served as a drag on the\npace of this recovery.\nCumulative Growth (%)\n60\n50\n40\nQ2 1954\nQ2 1958\nQ1 1961\nQ4 1970\nQ1 1975\nQ3 1980\nQ4 1982\nQ1 1991\nQ4 2001\nQ2 2009\nChange in Debt-to-GDP (Percentage Points)\n10\nPrevious Post-WWII Recoveries (Median)\nCurrent Recovery\n5\n0\n4.8\n30\n-5\n20\n-10\n10\n-15\n0\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40\nQuarters After Trough\n-20\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28\nQuarters After Recession End\n-18.3\nData as of Q3 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream, National Bureau of Economic Research.\nData through Q3 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, National Bureau of Economic Research, Federal Reserve\nEconomic Data.\nWe believe that no one factor explains the\ndifference in opinion. Instead, we rely on a\ncomprehensive framework of investigation that\nblends all of these elements, combining rigorous\nfundamental, quantitative and technical analysis,\nas well as the insights of an extensive network of\nexternal experts. At the same time, we continually\nendeavor to overcome the behavioral biases Nobel\nLaureate Daniel Kahneman and his collaborator\nAmos Tverksy have shown to affect economic\ndecision-making and tolerance for risk. These key\ncharacteristics of our investment process not only\nunderpin our continued view of US preeminence,\nbut also allow us to form a holistic view across\nglobal economies and asset classes. Of equal\nimportance, our framework provides us with a\nconsistent process by which to assess investment\nopportunities. While we believe our approach is\nrobust, we acknowledge that nothing can ensure\nwe will avoid the next downdraft.\nWe begin our Outlook with a brief review of\nthis recovery and place it in the context of past\nrecoveries showing that the glass is indeed half-full.\nWe address some of the key concerns regarding\ndemographics and declining productivity growth.\nWe show that US labor force demographics have\ndeteriorated and will continue to do so, especially\nin the absence of policy changes. Nonetheless, we\ndemonstrate why there is room for optimism about\nproductivity growth. The analysis leads us to a\nview of slightly above-trend growth for 2017 with\nsome upside potential from higher productivity\nand fiscal stimulus from a Trump administration.\nWe then turn to our one- and five-year expected\nreturns, which are driven by our view of a solid\neconomic foundation, a well-balanced economy\nand a positive growth trajectory in the US. We\nconclude our introductory section with the risks\nto our view, both upside and downside, including\na low probability of recession in 2017, high policy\nuncertainty under a Trump administration, possible\nglobal shocks from economic and currency policies\nin China, and the risks of geopolitical mishaps in\nEurope, the Middle East and the Far East.\nThis Recovery in Context—An Update\nThis recovery has been the slowest of the 10\nrecovery cycles since WWII, as shown in Exhibit\n3. Since the trough, US GDP has grown at an\nannualized rate of 2.1% through the third quarter\nof 2016, which is half the pace of the median and\naverage growth rates of all other recoveries. The\nslow GDP growth rate stands in stark contrast to\nthe recovery in the labor market and, most recently,\nin wages and household income. Impressively, the\ndecline in the unemployment rate has been the\nsecond-largest of all post-WWII recoveries.\n8 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 5: Change in US Personal Savings Rate\nSurrounding Historical Recessions\nThe increase in the personal savings rate in this recovery\nhas been unusually large.\nExhibit 6: Ratio of US Household Net Worth to\nDisposable Income\nReal estate price and financial asset gains have boosted the\nratio to near pre-crisis highs.\n%\nDeviation from Start of Recession (Percentage Points)\n8\nHistorical Range\nMedian\n6\nCurrent\n700\n639\n4\n2\n3.0\n600\n0\n500\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-3.4\n400\n-8\n-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34\nQuarters Relative to Start of Recession\nData through Q3 2016.\nNote: Quarter 0 marks the start of each recession since 1950, defined as the NBER recession\ncycle start.

The theories\nfall into six categories:\n• A “hangover” from the global financial crisis 11\n• “Secular stagnation” due to unfavorable\ndemographics\n• “Secular stagnation” due to declining\nproductivity growth\n• Mismeasurement of GDP statistics\n• Poor policies in Washington\n• A steady onslaught of external shocks\nWe briefly examine each of these six theories\nbelow—some of which we have touched upon\nin our prior Outlook publications. While there\nhas been further research on the topic over the\npast year, the debate has not yet been resolved\nand likely never will be to everyone’s satisfaction.\nOne star-studded group of experts believes that\nmost contributing factors other than weaker\ndemographics have dissipated or will dissipate, and\nthe US economy will remain structurally vibrant.\nAnother star-studded group believes that the best\ndays of the US are behind it, contending that even\nradical policy changes will not reverse this decline\nand that the 2016 election results are a testament\nto this “secular stagnation.”\nA Hangover from a Crisis\nProponents of the “hangover” theory suggest\nthat recoveries after a major financial crisis\ngenerally have been slower. In their book, This\nTime Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial\nFolly, 12 Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff\nuse historical data from 66 countries between\n1810 and 2010 to demonstrate that, historically,\nrecoveries following a major financial crisis have\nbeen markedly slower than other recoveries.\nFundamentally, one can argue that\nhouseholds deleverage for a long time to increase\nprecautionary savings, and corporations limit\ncapital expenditures to build up precautionary\ncash, out of fear that another major financial crisis\nis looming. As shown in Exhibit 4, the pace at\nwhich households deleveraged in this most recent\ncrisis was faster than in any other recovery in the\npost-WWII period; commensurately, the increase\nin the personal savings rate since the start of the\nrecession is unusually large relative to previous\ncycles (see Exhibit 5).\nAlong with higher savings, the increase in home\nprices to levels matching the February 2007 peak\n(as measured by the S&P/Case-Shiller US National\nHome Price Index on a seasonally adjusted\nbasis) and the appreciation in financial assets\nhave boosted the ratio of household net worth\nto disposable income to near pre-crisis levels, as\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n9\nshown in Exhibit 6. This improvement in net worth\nwill enable households to lower their savings\nrates going forward and support consumption.\nTherefore, even if the “hangover” hypothesis was\npartly valid earlier in the recovery, it should have\nless impact in the future.\nDuring the current recovery, the financial sector\nalso deleveraged substantially, partly due to the\nunusually high levels of leverage that existed as\nthe crisis began and partly due to greater financial\nregulation resulting from the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act signed\ninto federal law by President Barack Obama on\nJuly 21, 2010. As shown in Exhibit 7, the financial\nsector began to deleverage even before Dodd-Frank\nand has continued to do so through 2016.\nHowever, more recently, the pace of\ndeleveraging has abated, as shown in Exhibits 4\nand 7. Furthermore, such deleveraging may well\nbe bottoming and soon reverse as households\nand the financial sector face a more favorable\nfiscal and regulatory policy environment under\nPresident-elect Trump. For all practical purposes,\nthe “hangover” may now be over.\nSecular Stagnation: Unfavorable Demographics\nAs we discussed in our 2016 Outlook: The Last\nInnings, the term “secular stagnation” was first\ncoined by economist and Harvard professor\nAlvin Hansen in 1934 13 and fully described in his\npresidential address to the American Economic\nAssociation in 1938. 14 He predicted that poor\ndemographics, limited innovation and few\ntrading and investment opportunities would slow\nUS growth.\nThe term was more recently popularized\nby Lawrence Summers, professor at Harvard\nUniversity and former secretary of the Treasury,\nwhen he referred to secular stagnation in a 2013\nspeech at the International Monetary Fund. 15\nHansen’s dire predictions never came to pass,\nand the US experienced close to record levels of\nproductivity growth in the post-WWII period up\nto 1973, along with strong growth in the labor\nforce. This current cycle, in contrast to the decades\nimmediately following Hansen’s predictions, has\nbeen hampered by weak demographics and a\ndecline in the growth rate of the labor force. In a\nSeptember 2016 study, aptly called “How Should\nWe Think About This Recovery?,” Jay Shambaugh,\na member of the Council of Economic Advisers,\nshows that when one compares this recovery\nExhibit 7: Change in US Financial Sector Leverage\nFollowing Recessions\nA decrease in financial sector indebtedness has contributed\nto a slower-than-usual recovery.\nChange in Debt-to-GDP (Percentage Points)\n30\nPrevious Post-WWII Recoveries (Median)\nCurrent Recovery\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-40\n-50\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28\nQuarters After Recession End\nData through Q3 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, National Bureau of Economic Research, Federal Reserve\nEconomic Data.\nwith the average of past recoveries, the growth\ngap narrows significantly if one accounts for the\nnumber of people in the labor force. 16 Instead of\nthis recovery growing at about half the pace of\nthe average of past recoveries, the gap narrows to\n83% of the average: GDP per number of people in\nthe labor force has grown at an annualized rate of\n1.9%, compared with an average of 2.3% in past\nrecoveries. A recovery that appears to be at half\nthe pace of other recoveries is actually in line with\nother recoveries after adjusting for the size of the\nlabor force, as shown by comparing the red lines in\nExhibits 8 and 9.\nThere are two components to the unfavorable\ndemographics story. The first is simply the decline in\nthe growth rate of the US working-age population,\nwhich is driven by aging, the retirement of the baby\nboom generation and slower immigration.\nThis trend cannot be easily reversed; however,\nthe pace of decline can potentially be slowed.\nFor example, the commonly accepted retirement\nage of 65 can be extended. In fact, there is some\nevidence that baby boomers are working longer\nthan historical norms. 17 When life expectancy was\nabout 62 years in 1935, the retirement age for\nSocial Security was 65. Today, life expectancy in\nthe US is about 79 years, and the retirement age for\nSocial Security has been extended to 67 for those\nborn in 1960 or later. Of course, more broadly, the\nretirement age is still regarded as 65.

Both\nfactors depend on policy changes, and we do not\nhave any definitive reason to be either optimistic or\npessimistic at this time.\nThe second component of the unfavorable\ndemographics perspective has been the drop in\nlabor force participation, particularly among\nmales. Exhibit 10 shows the rapid growth in labor\nforce participation that occurred as the baby\nboom generation reached working age and as\nwomen joined the labor force in growing numbers\nafter 1950. The labor force participation rate,\nhowever, peaked in 2000 and declined by 0.3%\na year until it troughed at 62.4% in September\n2015. Most of the drop was driven by three\nfactors: significant decline in male labor force\nparticipation, retirement of baby boomers and the\ncyclical decline in demand for labor as a result\nof the global financial crisis. Some of the cyclical\ndecline reversed as the economic recovery entered\nits eighth year: the participation rate has risen to\n62.7% as of November 2016.\nThe male labor force participation, however,\nhas been declining, coincidentally also by 0.3%\nExhibit 10: US Labor Force Participation Rate\nBoth cyclical and structural factors have contributed to a\ndecline in the participation rate from the 2000 peak.\n%\n70\n68\n66\n64\n62\n60\n58\n56\n54\n52\n50\n1950 1956 1962 1968 1974 1980 1986 1992 1998 2004 2010 2016\nData through November 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream.\nper year—but since 1952. The trend has occurred\nacross all age cohorts. An important driver of this\ndecline has been reduced demand for lower-skilled\nand less-educated males. The US ranks 32 out of\n34 OECD countries in participation of prime-age\n(between the ages of 24 and 54) males in the labor\nforce, ahead of only Italy and Israel. 18 A Council of\nEconomic Advisers report in June 2016 attributed\nthat low ranking to the fact that the US spends\nless than other OECD countries on job search\n67.3\n62.7\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n11\nassistance and job training, and to the fact that the\nUS has a high rate of incarceration that especially\naffects lower-skilled men. 19 According to the\nreport, several policy measures can boost primeage\nmale labor force participation, including\n• Increased investment in infrastructure\n• Systemic reforms in the criminal justice system\nand in immigration policies\n• Tax reforms\n• Investment in education and training\nThis demographic aspect of secular stagnation is\nundeniable. In fact, an October 2016 paper by a\nteam at the Federal Reserve Board, “Understanding\nthe New Normal: The Role of Demographics,” 20\nshows that the slow pace of economic growth since\n1980 and the more pronounced decline in the last\ndecade could be predicted by a model looking\nat “fertility, labor supply, life expectancy, family\ncomposition, and international migration.”\nThus, a glass half-full or half-empty perspective\ndoes not change the facts on the ground. There is\nlittle cause for near-term optimism with respect\nto the slower growth rate of the labor force. The\ngeneral consensus is that the US labor force will\ngrow at an average of 0.6% per year in the next\nseveral decades, compared with 1.6% from 1950\nto 2000. 21\nIn the shorter term, infrastructure investment\nand other policies highlighted above may boost\nthe growth rate in the labor force, but it is hard to\nimagine growth rates reaching levels that would\nsupport President-elect Trump’s GDP growth\ntargets of 3–4% on a sustainable basis. 22\nSecular Stagnation: Declining\nProductivity Growth\nOf all the theories put forth to explain the slow\npace of this recovery, the one that has garnered the\nmost attention is declining productivity growth.\nOf all the theories put forth to explain\nthe slow pace of this recovery, the\none that has garnered the most\nattention is declining productivity\ngrowth.\nIt is also the most important issue in terms of its\nimpact on future trend growth in the US, which in\nturn has the greatest impact on the long-term rate\nof earnings growth and equity market returns.\nAs reviewed in last year’s Outlook, the technooptimists\nand the techno-pessimists are on opposite\nsides of the debate on declining productivity\ngrowth. Both camps have garnered new members;\neven Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and\nVice Chair Stanley Fischer have joined the fray. 23\nMost recently, in September 2016, the Brookings\nInstitution hosted a conference with leading\nexperts from both camps to debate the issue.\nWe should note that debates on productivity\nare nothing new. They have surfaced during past\nperiods of slow growth, as was the case in the early\n1990s. Even some of the players are the same:\nRobert Gordon was a techno-pessimist in the early\n1990s and remains so in the 2010s. 24\nPart of the productivity debate is philosophical.\nFor example, one question pertains to the increased\nuse of free digital services such as Facebook,\nGoogle Maps, Waze and Khan Academy. These\nservices yield “consumer surplus,” defined as the\nbenefits consumers derive from various activities\nover and above the price they pay. Should they be\nincluded in GDP if they are deemed “non-market”\nservices—those that are provided free of charge\nor at a fee that is well below 50% of production\ncosts? While social media such as Facebook may\n(or may not, depending on your perspective)\nprovide a service greater than the advertisement\nrevenues associated with the use of that service,\nsome will argue that if such services do not have an\nassociated market price, they are not part of GDP\nand therefore should not impact the calculation of\nproductivity levels. As the volume and the impact\nof these non-market services increase, we believe\nthat the methodology for measuring GDP will\nevolve to better reflect the value of these services.\nSuch improvements in measuring GDP are not\nuncommon. The Bureau of Economic\nAnalysis (BEA) conducts comprehensive\nrevisions of the national income and\nproduct accounts every five years, with\nthe goal of reflecting methodological\nand statistical improvements. Most\nrecently, in 2013, the BEA expanded\nits definition of fixed investment to\ninclude expenditures on research and\ndevelopment and expenditures on artistic\noriginals (e.g., books, music, television\n12 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 11: Pillars of the Investment Strategy Group’s Investment Philosophy\nINVESTMENT STRATEGY GROUP\nHistory is a\nUseful Guide\nAppropriate\nDiversification\nValue\nOrientation\nAppropriate\nHorizon\nConsistency\nANALYTICAL RIGOR\nASSET ALLOCATION PROCESS IS CLIENT-TAILORED AND INDEPENDENT OF IMPLEMENTATION VEHICLES\nseries, movies). Combined with some smaller\nimprovements, these changes added $560 billion to\nthe level of 2012 GDP, a 3.6% increase relative to\nthe prior estimate. 25\nThe more immediate—and important—\nquestion is whether we have entered a new phase\nin productivity growth trends that will keep\nproductivity growth at the low levels seen since\n2004. We believe that the answer is unknowable\nwith any degree of certainty; historically,\nproductivity forecasts have been notoriously\nwrong. In The Age of Diminished Expectations, 26\nfirst published in 1990, Paul Krugman, Nobel\nlaureate in economics and professor at City\nUniversity of New York, wrote that the lower pace\nof productivity growth experienced since the early\n1970s would most likely persist in the future. In\n1995, however, productivity growth rates increased\nand were more than double the rate of the prior\n12-year period.\nSimilarly, in 1997, the Congressional Budget\nOffice estimated that the long-run average annual\ngrowth rate of labor productivity would be 1.1%.\nBetween 1995 and 2004, the actual average annual\ngrowth rate of labor productivity was 3.2%. 27\nAs many of our clients know, one of the pillars\nof our investment philosophy is that history\nis a useful guide (see Exhibit 11). And history\ntells us that labor productivity has moved in\ncycles, with periods of low productivity growth\nfollowed by periods of high productivity growth.\nIn a forthcoming and comprehensive paper\ntitled “Seven Reasons to Be Optimistic About\nProductivity,” 28 Professors Lee Branstetter of\nCarnegie Mellon University and Daniel Sichel\nof Wellesley College show that periods of low\nproductivity growth have been followed by periods\nof high productivity growth since 1889, as seen\nin Exhibit 12. There is no reason to believe that\n“this time is different”; as many of you also know,\nwe believe that those words are among the most\ndangerous and misused words in our industry.\nOlivier Blanchard, senior fellow at the Peterson\nInstitute for International Economics and former\nchief economist at the IMF, has also shown that\nthe current period of low productivity growth does\nnot tell us much about future productivity trends.\nHe states that the correlation of “successive pairs\nof five-year averages of total factor productivity\ngrowth is only 0.20” since the mid-1970s. 29\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n13\nExhibit 12: US Labor Productivity Growth\nPeriods of slow productivity growth have been followed by\nperiods of stronger productivity gains.\nAverage Annual Growth Rate (%)\n4.0\nExhibit 13: Correlation of 5-Year US Productivity\nGrowth Rates With Following 5 Years’\nProductivity Growth Rates\nRecent productivity trends tell us little about the future.\nCorrelation\n0.25\n3.5\n3.0\n3.4\n3.1\n3.2\n3.2\n0.20\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.6\n2.0\n1.5\n1.3\n0.15\n0.10\n0.14\n0.08\n1.0\n0.5\n0.05\n0.0\n1889–1917 1917–1927 1927–1940 1940–1948 1948–1973 1973–1995 1995–2004 2004–2015\n0.00\nSince 1957 Since 1970\nData through 2015.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Lee Branstetter and Daniel Sichel, “Seven Reasons to Be\nOptimistic About Productivity,” forthcoming Peterson Institute for International Economics\nPolicy Brief.\nData through Q3 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Haver Analytics, Olivier Blanchard, “Three Remarks About\nthe US Treasury Yield Curve,” Peterson Institute for International Economics, June 22, 2016.\nWe have examined labor productivity growth\nrates and, as shown in Exhibit 13, find even\nlower correlations.\nThere are two issues to consider. First, if the\nreported productivity growth rates are accurate,\nthen the exceptionally low rates of the last 10 years\naccount for part of the slow pace of this recovery.\nHowever, the current low productivity growth rates\ndo not portend low growth rates going forward.\nJust as Hansen was proven wrong on his secular\nstagnation theory and Krugman was proven wrong\non his diminished expectations for the US economy\n(and they were both influenced by their pessimistic\nview on productivity), those who extrapolate\nstagnation from the current productivity trends\nmay be proven wrong as well.\nSecond, as we discuss below, there is also a high\nprobability that real GDP may be mismeasured.\nIf real GDP is mismeasured, it follows that\nIf real GDP is mismeasured, it follows\nthat productivity is also mismeasured,\nthereby invalidating the whole theory of\nsecular stagnation and the decline of the\nUS economy.\nproductivity is also mismeasured, thereby\ninvalidating the whole theory of secular stagnation\nand the decline of the US economy.\nMismeasurement of GDP Statistics\nIn addition to the productivity debate, there is\na debate as to whether we are measuring GDP\ncorrectly in the first place. The key argument being\nmade is that while we correctly measure the value\nof nominal GDP based on the value of goods and\nservices, we mismeasure the value of real GDP\nwhen we convert nominal GDP to real GDP using\nvarious price indices, and this therefore understates\nthe pace of this recovery. This debate garnered\nconsiderable attention in 2016.\nThe mismeasurement argument states that\nthe official price indices do not adequately reflect\nsignificant improvements in many products,\nespecially in information and communication\ntechnology, due to the methodology\nused by the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (BLS) and the BEA. If the\nprice indices do not adequately\nreflect the greater capacity of\nan improved product such as a\nsmartphone or a microprocessor,\nthen the price index used to convert\nnominal GDP to real GDP is too\nhigh. And if the price index is too\nhigh, then real GDP is understated.\n14 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nIt follows that if real GDP is understated, then\nwhat appears to be a slow recovery is not as slow\nas reported and what appears to be a period of low\nproductivity growth is not as low as reported.\nWe believe that the evidence favors the\nmismeasurement argument. At a September 2016\nBrookings Institution conference on productivity,\nMartin Feldstein, Harvard professor and president\nemeritus of the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, also concluded that “the official statistics\nsubstantially underestimate the real growth\nof output” after studying the methods used to\nmeasure price indices. 30\nWe point to three examples to illustrate the\nmismeasurement argument. First, our colleagues in\nGoldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research (GIR)\nhave pointed out that the official price indices for\ninformation and communication technology show\nan implausible gap between the price deflation in\ncomputers and that in communications equipment,\nsoftware and other IT equipment (see Exhibit 14).\nThey question how “a given dollar outlay now\nbuys about 10 times as much computer in real\nterms as 20 years ago, but it only buys about 10%\nmore software.” 31\nOur colleagues’ conclusion that the\nofficial price indices for the information and\ncommunication technology sector are overstated\nmatches that of a 2015 study of microprocessor\npricing by David Byrne of the Federal Reserve\nBoard, Professor Stephen Oliner of UCLA, and\nSichel. 32 The trio created an index showing that\nprices for microprocessor units used in desktop\npersonal computers declined by an average\nannual rate of 43% between 2008 and 2013,\nwhile the official Producer Price Index (PPI)\nfor these units declined by an average annual\nrate of 8%—substantially mismeasuring the\nreal value created by this sector of information\ntechnology equipment. They point out that\nbecause microprocessor units represent about half\nof US shipments of semiconductors, the rate of\ninnovation in this sector is inevitably mismeasured.\nA second example of mismeasurement that we\ncan all readily appreciate involves the quality and\nproduct improvements in smartphones. Hal Varian,\nchief economist at Google and emeritus professor\nat the University of California at Berkeley, has\nestimated that globally, people took over 1.6\ntrillion photos in 2015 using their smartphones,\ncompared with 80 billion in 2000 using cameras\nand film. The price of each photo taken has gone\nExhibit 14: US Technology Price Indices\nThe implausible gap with hardware suggests IT and\ncommunication price indices are likely overstated.\nQ1 1995 = 100\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\nSoftware\nHardware (Computers and Peripherals)\nCommunications Equipment\nOther IT Equipment\n20\n9\n0\n1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015\nData through 2015.\nNote: Other IT Equipment represents medical and non-medical equipment and instruments.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis.\nfrom 50 cents to zero for smartphone users; 1.6\ntrillion photos that would have contributed $800\nbillion to GDP have no impact on GDP in the\ncurrent framework. GDP has declined since camera\nand film sales have fallen without a commensurate\nquality adjustment for smartphones. Of course,\nfewer photos would have been taken had the\nsmartphone not been developed, but the point\nstill stands. 33\nSimilarly, Varian shows that with the onset of\nthe commercial application of GPS technology,\nproductivity growth in trucking was twice the\naggregate US productivity growth, yet when GPS\nfunctionality was added to smartphones basically\nat no additional charge, GDP declined because\nsales of stand-alone GPS systems fell. 34\nFinally, a third example, also provided by\nVarian, shows that, because GDP does not fully\ncount the export of intangibles such as software\nand design, GDP is understated. He shows how an\niPhone manufactured by Foxconn in China using\nparts from 28 countries and exported to France\nhas no direct impact on US GDP. Varian concludes\nthat in a global supply chain, US design and\nsoftware that is replicated outside the US through\noffshore manufacturing and exported to a third\ncountry never impacts US GDP measures directly,\nparticularly if the profits are not repatriated and\nredeployed in the US. 35\nOur colleagues in GIR continue to estimate that\nsuch mismeasurements lower reported annual real\n114\n90\n44\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n15\nWe believe that productivity in\nhealth care is underestimated.\nConsider IBM’s Watson Health,\nan artificial intelligence system\nthat can read 200 million pages\nof text in 3 seconds. As of 2015,\nWatson had amassed 315 billion\ndata points representing health\nrecords, lab results, genomic\ntests and clinical studies. The\nsystem processes patients’ cases\nagainst its ever-growing database\nand recommends customized\ntreatment options. With such\ndevelopments, we expect\ncontinued improvement in growth\nof productivity in health care.\n“If productivity growth\nwere better measured,\nparticularly in health and\nother services, the growth\nrate would look better than\nis currently reported.”\nMartin Neil Baily and Nicholas Montalbano, “Why Is U.S. Productivity\nGrowth So Slow? Possible Explanations and Policy Responses,”\nBrookings Institution, September 2016.\nGDP growth by about 0.7 percentage point, similar\nto their estimate reported in our Outlook last year.\nOf course, not all experts believe that there is\na mismeasurement problem. Notable among them\nis Chad Syverson of the University of Chicago,\nwho raises four points in making this case. 36\nFirst, he states that the productivity slowdown\nhas been global in nature and unrelated to\ncountries’ consumption or production intensities\nof information and communication technology.\nSecond, he states that estimates of consumer surplus\nare too small relative to his estimates of lost GDP\ndue to slower productivity growth. Third, he argues\nthat if such mismeasurement existed, the growth rate\nin the information and communication technology\nsector would be a multiple of its stated growth rate.\nFinally, while he acknowledges that gross domestic\nincome has been higher than GDP since 2004 and\nthe gap might reflect the higher wages of workers\nwho are producing non-market digital services, he\ndoes not believe that this difference is evidence of\nmismeasured GDP because the trend started earlier\nthan the slowdown in productivity growth.\nA somewhat similar line of reasoning has been\npresented by Byrne, John Fernald of the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco and Marshall\nReinsdorf of the IMF in a paper titled “Does the\nUnited States Have a Productivity Slowdown or a\nMeasurement Problem?” 37 While they agree that\nproductivity growth has been mismeasured in the\npast, they argue that the mismeasurement has been\nnegligible in the 2004–15 period partly because\ncomputer hardware, for which mismeasurement\nwas once a factor, now makes up a smaller part of\nGDP. Therefore, the impact is less in the 2004–15\nperiod than it was in the 1995–2004 period when\nproductivity growth was much higher. They also\nstate that free digital products not only are nonmarket\nand should not be counted in GDP, but also\nare not sizable enough to account for the level of\ndecline in productivity growth rates.\nExperts’ opinions on mismeasurement continue\nto evolve. In fact, in a subsequent publication coauthored\nwith Carol Corrado of the Conference\nBoard, Byrne found a significantly higher level\nof software price mismeasurement than assumed\nin his prior paper. 38 He has also co-authored a\nstudy on prices and depreciation for computer\ntablets such as iPads, proving that quality-adjusted\nprice indices for tablets have fallen much faster\nthan the broader price indices for computers and\nperipheral equipment. 39\n16 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 15: 10-Year Net Survival Rate of Breast and Prostate Cancer Patients\nImproved cancer survival rates reflect significant gains in science and technology.\n%\n100\n75\n72\n76\n78\n75\n84\n60\n62\n50\n40\n48\n34\n25\n25 25\n0\n1971–1972 1980–1981 1990–1991 2000–2001 2005–2006 2010–2011 1971–1972 1980–1981 1990–1991 2000–2001 2005–2006 2010–2011\nBreast Cancer\nProstate Cancer\nPeriod of Diagnosis\nData as of November 2014.\nNote: Based on cancer statistics for the UK.

We know that\ninformation and communication technology has\nevolved significantly and innovation is occurring\nat a rapid pace. We know that the BEA reviews\nits statistical methodologies every five years\nand revises them as needed, recognizing that\nmeasurement methodologies have to evolve with\nthe evolution of the US economy. We also know\nthat we as consumers carry incredibly powerful\ndigital equipment in the palms of our hands and\npay less for it than we paid for equipment with\nlesser functionalities not so long ago. Common\nsense supplemented by extensive research by the\nexperts on productivity and mismeasurement\nreinforces our view of a glass half-full when it\ncomes to innovation and productivity in the US.\nWe realize this debate will be resolved only\nwith the benefit of hindsight, in the same way\nthat realized productivity growth exceeded the\nWe realize this debate will be resolved\nonly with the benefit of hindsight, in\nthe same way that realized productivity\ngrowth exceeded the prognostications\nof Hansen in the late 1930s and\nKrugman in the early 1990s.\nprognostications of Hansen in the late 1930s and\nKrugman in the early 1990s. Our clients will be\ninundated with conflicting views from headlines\nin the media and books with captivating titles.\nSeparating fact from fiction remains challenging.\nRecently, an article in the Wall Street Journal\nhighlighted “dwindling gains in science, technology\nand medicine.” 40 The article suggested that\nimprovements in breast cancer mortality have\nslowed since 1985. Exhibit 15 shows the 10-year\nnet survival rate for breast cancer and prostate\ncancer since 1971. Maybe it is only a matter of\nperspective, but, to us, a 78% 10-year survival rate\nfor breast cancer and an 84% 10-year survival\nrate for prostate cancer represent significant\nimprovements over the rates of the early 1980s,\n48% and 25%, respectively, and are even more\nsignificant for those whose lives have been saved.\nProbably one of the more amusing instances\nof conflicting perspectives can be seen in the\n2016 publication of two books with\ndiametrically opposed messages:\nProgress: Ten Reasons to Look\nForward to the Future 41 and The\nInnovation Illusion: How So Little\nIs Created by So Many Working So\nHard, 42 both written by authors born\nin Sweden in the early 1970s. Our\nviews, of course, are more aligned\nwith the first book. The second book,\nhowever, raises important concerns\nabout excessive regulation and how\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n17\nsuch regulation is “killing frontier innovation.”\nIndeed, some have put forth the prevalence of\npoor government policies as one of the theories to\nexplain the slow pace of this recovery.\nPoor Policies in Washington\nOne of the theories that has been getting more\ntraction recently attributes the slower recovery\nto poor policies enacted in Washington. In a June\n2016 article about the US economy, Gregory\nMankiw, professor at Harvard University and\nformer chair of the Council of Economic Advisers\nfor President George W. Bush, highlighted “policy\nmissteps,” 43 including misguided fiscal policy, as\na possible contributor to the slow pace of growth\nsince the global financial crisis.\nOne unusual feature of this recovery has, in\nfact, been a contractionary fiscal policy. We have\nderived an approximate historical measure of\nfiscal policy changes by estimating changes in the\ncyclically adjusted federal budget as a percentage\nof GDP. We note that, by this measure, as far back\nas 1890, fiscal policy has been expansionary in all\nbut three recoveries following a recession—with\nthe fiscal policy in the current recovery being the\nmost contractionary, as shown in Exhibit 16. In\nthis recovery, the budget deficit as a share of GDP\nwas reduced by 1.0% a year, compared to an\naverage widening of the budget deficit by 1.3% a\nyear in all other recoveries after severe recessions.\nThe average increase in the size of the budget\nTwo books published in 2016 and written by Swedes born in the early\n1970s highlight the conflicting perspectives on productivity.\nJohan Norberg’s Progress cover used with permission of Johan Norberg\nand Oneworld Publications.

A swing of 1.8 percentage points\nwould have had a material impact on the pace of\nthis recovery.\nProfessor Alan Blinder of Princeton University\nand former vice chair at the Federal Reserve echoed\nthe sentiment by stating that partisan politics have\nprevented progress in dealing with important\neconomic issues. 44 Shambaugh has outlined various\nmeasures, such as infrastructure spending proposed\nby President Obama in his fiscal year 2017 budget,\nthat would positively impact productivity and labor\nforce participation. 45 The budget was not approved.\nSummers has similarly called for expansionary fiscal\npolicy through infrastructure spending, but such\npolicies have not been pursued. 46\nIncreased regulation has also been blamed\nfor some of the slow pace of this recovery. A\nSeptember 2016 working paper by Martin\nNeil Baily and Nicholas Montalbano of the\nBrookings Institution on the slow growth of US\nproductivity shows that while productivity in the\nmost productive firms is growing rapidly, their\nbest practices are not spreading to the rest of the\nplayers in a given industry. 47 Exhibit 17 shows the\nwidening gap between the productivity growth\nrates of firms at the frontier of innovation and\n0.5\n-0.6\n1.0\n-0.8\n-1.3\n18 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 17: Labor Productivity Growth for\nDifferent Groups of Firms\nRapid productivity growth of firms at the frontier of\ninnovation is not spreading to the rest of the industry.\nExhibit 18: US Financial Conditions Index\nConditions tightened significantly due to global shocks\nemanating from the Eurozone, oil prices and China.\nIndex, 2001= 1 (Log Points)\n1.5\nFrontier Firms—Top 5% in Each Industry/Year\nFrontier Firms—Top 100 in Each Industry/Year\nNon-Frontier Firms\n1.4\n1.3\n1.39\n1.36\nUS Financial Conditions Index\n101.5\n101.0\n100.5\n+142bp\n100.0\nTightening\n+118bp\n+104bp\n1.2\n99.5\n1.1\n1.06\n99.0\n1.0\n98.5\n0.9\n2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013\nData through 2013.\nNote: Average across 24 OECD countries and 22 manufacturing and 27 market services\nindustries.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, OECD preliminary results based on Dan Andrews, Chiara\nCriscuolo and Peter N.

Baily and Montalbano\nsuggest that increased regulation after the crisis\nmay be partially responsible for the widening gap\nbetween frontier firms and the rest of the industry,\nwhich lowers overall productivity growth rates\nacross the economy and hence lowers the pace of\neconomic growth.\nOur colleagues in GIR think that lower capital\ninvestment accounts for the lack of diffusion of\nnew technologies from more productive firms to\nless productive firms. 48 Here, again, it is likely that\na more favorable business environment could have\nboosted capital expenditures and increased overall\nproductivity levels.\nWe conclude that it is reasonable to assign\nsome of the weakness in this recovery to less\neffective fiscal and regulatory policies out of\nWashington rather than to structural shortcomings\nin the US economy.\nA Steady Onslaught of External Shocks\nA sixth theory posits that numerous external\nshocks explain the slow pace of this recovery.\nJust as the US economy was recovering from the\ntrough of 2009, the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis\njolted global financial markets. The Eurozone\nwas a source of uncertainty and financial market\nvolatility beyond the initial shock in 2010 as the\ncrisis spread from Greece to Spain and Italy.\nThe Eurozone crisis was followed by a series\nof what the Brookings Institution has called the\n“fiscal fights of the Obama administration.” 49 The\nfirst fiscal fight resulted in the Standard and Poor’s\n(S&P) downgrade of US Treasury debt in August\n2011. The equity markets, as measured by the S&P\n500 Index, dropped about 19% between April and\nOctober of 2011.\nTaken together, the Eurozone sovereign debt\ncrisis and the first of the fiscal fights tightened\nUS financial conditions 50 by 142 basis points (see\nExhibit 18). GIR estimates that a 100 basis point\ntightening of financial conditions is equivalent to a\nfederal funds hike of 150 basis points and a drag\non GDP growth of about one percentage point.\nThe drop in oil prices from a post-crisis high\nof $107 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate\nin June 2014 to a trough of $26 per barrel in\nFebruary 2016 also provided a shock to the\neconomy. Employment and capital expenditures\nin the oil and gas sector dropped by 29% and\n67%, respectively, from peak levels seen in 2014.\nThe sector’s par-weighted default rate excluding\ndistressed exchanges reached 14.6% and including\nsuch exchanges 19.8%, in October 2016. 51\nBroad-based fear of policy mistakes in China\nand unexpected depreciation of the renminbi were\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n19\nExhibit 19: US Equity Volatility\nSpikes in equity volatility have corresponded with major global shocks.\nVIX Level\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n1 Global Financial Crisis\n2 First Greek Bailout\n3 Debt Ceiling, S&P Downgrade,\nEurozone Sovereign Debt Crisis\n4 Greek Default\n5 ISIL, Ebola\n6 Renminbi Depreciation\nSPX: -42%\n80.9\n(11/20/08)\n1\n45.8\n(5/20/10)\n40.7\n(8/24/15)\n40\n30\n20\n10\n18.8\n(8/22/08)\nSPX: -12% 2\n15.6\n(4/12/10)\nSPX: -19% 3\n26.7\n(6/1/12)\nSPX: -10% 4\n14.7 14.3\n(4/21/11) (3/26/12)\n28.1\n26.3\n(2/11/16)\n(10/15/14)\nSPX: 6\nSPX:\nSPX: -12% -13%\n-7%\n6\n5\n14.5\n11.5 12.0 (11/3/15)\n(8/22/14) (7/17/15)\n0\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nData through December 31, 2016.\nNote: The red arrows show the S&P 500's (SPX's) peak-to-trough declines around each episode.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\n48.0\n(8/8/11)\nanother shock to the financial markets, resulting\nin the tightening of financial conditions in the\nUS in mid-2015 and early 2016, with US equities\ndropping by more than 10% in both periods.\nExhibit 19 provides a time line of shocks,\nwhich, in all likelihood, dampened the pace of the\nUS recovery.\nIn Summary\nAs we review the six theories that could account\nfor the notably slow pace of this recovery, we\nbelieve that all have some merit. Recovering\nfrom the hangover from the deepest recession\nsince the Great Depression took a little longer.\nDemographics have not been favorable.\nProductivity growth appears lower, but that fact\ndoes not portend weak productivity growth in the\nfuture. Productivity growth is also probably not as\nweak as it appears, given some mismeasurement\nof GDP. Fiscal and regulatory policies hampered\nthe economic recovery. And the global backdrop\nprovided a steady source of shocks that slowed\ngrowth in the US.\nThat said, we feel confident that the US\ncontinues to progress on a solid footing, that the\nrecovery is intact and, as we argued in our 2016\nOutlook: The Last Innings, that this recovery and\nbull market have another inning or two left to run.\nThe glass is still half-full.\nWe now turn to our expected returns for the\nnext one and five years.\nOne- and Five-Year Expected\nTotal Returns\nThe Investment Strategy Group began producing\none- and five-year annualized expected total\nreturns for major asset classes in our 2013\nOutlook. Since then, our key message has been\nto stay invested in US equities despite the low\nreturns we have expected for the asset class.\nOur recommendation has been driven by a low\nprobability of recession, a reasonable probability\nof upside for equities, zero expected returns for\ncash and negative expected returns for bonds.\nWe have presented these one- and five-year\nannualized expected returns to: a) provide more\ncontext for our investment recommendations; b)\nencourage our clients to have a longer investment\nhorizon; and c) increase the odds that our clients\nhave greater staying power to withstand market\ndowndrafts.\nFulfilling these three priorities is even\nmore imperative moving forward. Our return\nexpectations are lower than in prior years after\nseveral years of outsized returns in equities\nand high yield, and, at the same time, we are\nconfronted with tremendous economic policy and\ngeopolitical uncertainty. We have been faced with\nsuch uncertainty in the past, but today (in contrast\nwith periods such as 2008), we no longer have the\nwind at our back with the benefit of cheap equity\nand high yield valuations. In 2008, we believed\nthat attractive valuations would eventually lead to\nhigh prospective returns in US equities and high\n20 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nyield, notwithstanding short-term uncertainty.\nAt the dawn of 2017, we face uncertainty, but\nUS equities and high yield are expensive, and\nvaluations no longer provide much margin of\nsafety and protection from the downside. Similarly,\nother asset classes such as fixed income provide\nnegligible returns but come with downside risk,\ne.g., if the incoming Trump administration’s fiscal\npolicy is more stimulative than we expect or if the\nFederal Reserve raises interest rates at a more rapid\npace than we expect.\nAs we prepared our one- and five-year\nannualized expected returns for this Outlook and\nfinalized our investment recommendations for\n2017, we were struck by two observations.\nFirst, the general recommendations and\nvolatility warnings in our Outlook publications\nover the last several years have been similar, have\nbeen directionally correct and have generally\nadded value to our clients’ portfolios. We have\ncontinuously recommended that clients stay\ninvested in their strategic US equity allocation. We\nhave also recommended maintaining some tactical\ntilts such as an allocation to high yield. Yet we\nhave warned clients to be prepared for bouts of\nvolatility. Last year, our exact message to clients\nwith respect to volatility was that “markets will\nbe volatile, so an asset class that performs well in\nthe first half of the year may perform particularly\npoorly in the latter part of the year; however,\ninvestors—unlike traders—should not try to time\nsuch short-term moves.” 52 It is very important that\nclients heed this warning—not just for 2017 but\nfor their entire investing lives.\nExhibit 20 illustrates the point. We have\ncompared the performance of some of the bestperforming\nasset classes and sectors for the year\nwith the performance of those assets at their worst\nThe general recommendations and\nvolatility warnings in our Outlook\npublications over the last several\nyears have been similar, have been\ndirectionally correct and have\ngenerally added value to our clients’\nportfolios.\nExhibit 20: Returns in 2016\nSome of the best-performing assets in 2016 experienced\nsignificant declines before recovering.\nTotal Return (%)\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-10.3\nReturn Through Year-End 2016\nReturn Through 2016 Low (2/11/16)\n12.0\nS&P 500 Total Return Index\n-19.1\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\npoint of the year. Energy high yield provides an\nexcellent example. On February 11, 2016, the\nUS energy high yield sector (as measured by the\nBloomberg Barclays High Yield Energy Total\nReturn Index) was down 19.1% year to date—one\nof the worst-performing sub-asset classes at that\ntime. Similarly, the US bank sector (as measured by\nthe S&P Banks Select Industry Total Return Index)\nwas down 21.7% over the same period. We had\nin place tactical tilts in both sectors. As oil prices\nrecovered, high yield energy securities rallied, with\nthe benchmark index ending the year up 37.4%—a\nwild swing of 56 percentage points from low to\nhigh. US banks also rallied initially in response\nto prospects of higher interest rates and later in\nanticipation of less regulation under a Trump\nadministration. The bank sector index rallied to\nend the year 31.3% higher than at the start—an\nequally wild swing of 53 percentage\npoints from low to high.\nWe have to be realistic: we cannot\nanticipate such market swings on\na consistent basis. Therefore, it is\nimperative that clients maintain a\nlong investment horizon, be tactical\nwhen investment opportunities present\nthemselves—usually at times of extreme\nstress in the financial markets—and\n37.4\nBloomberg Barclays High\nYield Energy Total Return\nIndex\n-21.7\n31.3\nS&P Banks Select Industry\nTotal Return Index\notherwise stay invested in the appropriate\nstrategic asset allocation.\nOur second observation was that\nour five-year annualized return forecasts\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n21\nExhibit 21: Historical Total Returns vs. ISG’s 2013 Outlook 5-Year Prospective Total Returns\nOur 5-year return forecasts have so far been relatively accurate for the bulk of assets in our diversified model portfolio, but\nwe have not been right across the board.\n% Annualized\n20\n15\n5-Year Annualized Projected Return—As of December 31, 2012\nActual Annualized Returns—Since December 31, 2012\n14\n18\n14\n15\n19\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n0\n1\n0\n2\n4\n5\n5\n3\n6 6\n7\n-5\n8\n11\n11\n-2\n10\n-10\n10-Year\nTreasuries\nMuni 1–10 US High Yield Hedge Funds S&P 500 Japanese\nEquity\nEmerging Market\nLocal Debt\nEAFE Equity EM Equity (US$) Euro Stoxx 50 US Banks\nData through December 31, 2016.\nNote: Rounded to the nearest whole integer.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream.\nhave also been relatively accurate for the bulk\nof assets in our diversified model portfolio. In\nExhibit 21, we compare the five-year annualized\nexpected total returns published in our 2013\nOutlook to what transpired over the last four\nyears. Our forecasts for 1) fixed income returns\nincluding both investment grade and high yield,\n2) hedge fund returns, and 3) EAFE equity returns\nwere close to the mark. Directionally, we were\nalso right about US equity returns but off in terms\nof magnitude. We were also struck by how close\nour US bank sector return forecasts were to the\nrealized returns—approximately a quarter of which\nwere realized after the November election. This\nobservation has reinforced our belief in one of the\npillars of our investment philosophy: having the\nappropriate horizon for various strategies is critical\nto long-term success.\nNot surprisingly, we have not been right\nacross the board. We underestimated Japanese\nequity returns by 11.4 percentage points on an\nannualized basis and we overestimated emerging\nmarket equity and emerging market local debt\nreturns, by sizable 13.5 and 12.1 percentage\npoints, respectively, on an annualized basis.\nJapanese equities realized an annualized 18%\nreturn and EM equity and local debt realized\nnegative returns, at -2% and -5% annualized,\nrespectively. While our forecasts were off\nthe mark, our emerging market investment\nrecommendations were on the mark. In mid-2013,\nwe recommended clients reduce their strategic\nallocation to emerging market assets.

These fault\nlines were discussed in detail in our December\n2013 Insight, Emerging Markets: As the\nTide Goes Out.\nWe continue to recommend a zero allocation\nto emerging market debt (dollar-denominated\nand local currency debt) and a 2% allocation\nto emerging market equities in a moderate-risk\ndiversified portfolio. We highlight emerging market\nassets because, yet again, our base case returns,\nespecially for emerging market equities, appear\ncompelling, but we are not recommending a\ntactical allocation to this asset class. As we discuss\nbelow in our review of the risks to our economic\nand financial market outlook, China is our biggest\nsource of concern in 2017 and for the next few\nyears. Emerging markets are the countries that\nwould be most negatively impacted by any shocks\nemanating from China.\nChina is our biggest source of\nconcern in 2017 and for the next\nfew years. Emerging markets are\nthe countries that would be most\nnegatively impacted by any shocks\nemanating from China.\nOur 2017 expected returns, shown in Exhibit\n22, are the lowest returns we have published since\nthe global financial crisis. Not a single broad asset\nclass is expected to have double-digit returns. Cash\nhas an expected return of 1%. Expected returns\nfor intermediate investment grade fixed income\nsecurities range between 0% and 1% depending\non maturities, an expectation driven by our view of\nrising rates as the Federal Reserve hikes the federal\nfunds rate two or three times in 2017. US equities,\nwhich are the most expensive of global equities,\nhave an expected return of about 3%, and we\nexpect slightly higher returns in other developed\nmarket equities. Hedge funds, an asset class for\nwhich we have had modest single-digit return\nexpectations since our 2013 Outlook (as shown in\nExhibit 21), should continue to have modest returns;\nwe expect a 3% return before taxes, compared to a\n5% annualized return expectation in 2013 and an\nannualized return of 3% over the last four years.\nIn aggregate, a moderate-risk diversified\nportfolio for taxable clients is expected to\nhave a return of about 3%. We must note\nthat our return expectations are not meant\nto promote a specific investment, and\nthat their basis on current capital market\nassumptions implies they will likely\nchange over the course of the year.\nAt this point, our clients may well be\nasking why they should remain invested\nin a diversified portfolio with such paltry\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n23\nreturn expectations, given all the economic policy\nand geopolitical uncertainty mentioned earlier. We\nbelieve there are three compelling arguments.\nFirst, there is potential for upside\nsurprises in 2017:\n• Saudi Arabia and the rest of the oil producers\nmay stick to the announced oil production cuts,\nthereby boosting energy sector earnings.\n• A Trump administration fiscal stimulus could\nboost growth by more than we expect.\n• Corporate tax cuts could increase corporate\nsector profitability.\n• A possible tax holiday could encourage US\nmultinational corporations to repatriate\nsome of their earnings and deploy them for\nstock buybacks.\nWe assign a 25% probability of such upside\nsurprises relative to a 60% probability of our base\ncase scenario and a 15% downside probability.\n(Please see Section III, 2017 Financial Markets\nOutlook, for a more detailed discussion.)\nSecond, we recommend staying invested\nbecause we believe that the probability of a\nrecession in the US is about 15% over the next\nyear. There is an 85% chance that the economy\nwill grow at a rate of about 2% or higher. Absent\na recession, equities are more likely to generate\npositive returns. Obviously, the probability of\na recession is substantially higher over the next\nfive years, and our five-year annualized expected\nreturns incorporate a 70–80% probability of a\nrecession.\nThird, and most importantly, we do not see\nbetter investment alternatives. Cash will provide\nnegligible returns with no upside, and we expect\ninvestment grade bonds to have equally negligible\nreturns with little upside, if any. We also expect\nhedge funds, in aggregate, to lag equities on an\nafter-tax basis.\nWe expect similarly modest returns from our\ntactical tilts.\nAs equities, high yield and the dollar\nhave rallied over the course of the\nyear, we have continued to reduce the\noverall risk level of our tactical tilts.\nOur Tactical Tilts\nAs equities, high yield and the dollar have rallied\nover the course of the year, we have continued to\nreduce the overall risk level of our tactical tilts. At\nthe beginning of 2016, we had already reduced our\nexposures by 50% relative to peak levels in 2015, as\nmeasured by value at risk. By the end of 2016, we had\nreduced exposures further, based on our investment\ndiscipline of averaging in and out of our tactical tilts.\nUnderweight Fixed Income: We continue to\nrecommend underweighting US fixed income assets\nas the Federal Reserve slowly but steadily raises the\nfederal funds rate. We expect the 10-year Treasury\nbond yield to range between 2.5% and 3.0%. As\na result, we forecast a 1% return across short- and\nintermediate-maturity fixed income assets and a\nnear zero return for the 10-year Treasury. Longer\nmaturities are expected to have negative returns.\nWe also recommend underweighting fixed income\nassets to fund tactical tilts given their higher\nexpected returns.\nOverweight to High Yield: While we reduced\nour tactical allocation to high yield assets by half\nthroughout 2016, we continue to recommend an\nallocation to general high yield bonds, high yield\nenergy bonds and high yield bank loans. The\nincremental yield in such securities, adjusted for\ndefaults, is still compelling, with expected returns\nof about 4% for high yield bonds and high yield\nenergy bonds and about 5% for bank loans.\nWe forecast that crude oil prices will stay in the\n$45–65 range, partly owing to some production\ndiscipline by Saudi Arabia as the largest swing\nproducer. Our bank loan tilt is further supported\nby a rising rate environment; the coupon rate on\nbank loans will be reset higher as LIBOR rises. 54\nModest Overweight to US Banks: We maintain\na modest overweight to US banks despite their\n31% return in 2016. Banks will benefit from rising\nrates, especially if the increase is greater in the\nshort end of the yield curve. About 60%\nof changes in the net interest margin of\nbanks is typically driven by changes in\nshort rates since they are used for setting\nthe banks’ prime lending rate. Banks will\nalso likely benefit from a more favorable\nregulatory environment under a Trump\nadministration. We forecast a return\nof about 7%.\n24 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nOverweight US Energy Infrastructure Master\nLimited Partnerships (MLPs): We initiated a\ndirect allocation to energy MLPs in late January\n2016 and have maintained that tilt. Given our\nassumptions about oil prices, we believe that the\ncash distributions from MLPs are generally secure\nand provide a yield to investors of just over 7%.\nIn the absence of any valuation changes, the yield\ntranslates into a high single-digit tax-advantaged\nreturn. Any growth in cash flow distribution or\nimprovements in valuation relative to the S&P 500\nwould provide some upside.\nOverweight Spanish Equities: We maintain an\noverweight to Spanish equities on a currencyhedged\nbasis. This tactical tilt was introduced in\nAugust 2013, and we have adjusted the size of\nthe overweight about a dozen times since. Spanish\nequities offer some of the cheapest valuations\nacross the developed markets, attractive dividend\nyields, expected earnings growth of 4.6%, aided\nby healthy domestic growth, and a particularly\nwell-capitalized 55 banking sector that has a lower\nnonperforming loan ratio than the Eurozone bank\naverage. Furthermore, Spain is unlikely to face the\nsame political uncertainty as Germany, France and\nItaly in 2017. We expect high single-digit returns\nfor Spanish equities.\nShort Five-Year German Bunds: We recommend\na short position in five-year German bunds as\nthe ECB embarks upon the process of shifting\nits monetary policy. After the December 2016\nmeeting, the ECB announced that it would reduce\nits monthly purchases of bonds from €80 billion to\n€60 billion starting in March 2017 and continuing\nthrough December 2017. We expect the ECB to\nend all purchases sometime in 2018, barring any\nshocks. As a result, we think interest rates for\nEurozone sovereign debt will rise gradually over\nthe course of the year, which in the case of German\nbunds means they will become less negative. We\nexpect a modest 2% return from this tilt.\nShort Chinese Renminbi: We have increased our\nbearish position on the Chinese renminbi over\nthe course of 2016. China is under pressure from\nmultiple sides: the need for loose monetary policy\nto achieve the leadership’s 6.5% target GDP\ngrowth rate, 32 months of capital outflows that\nhave accelerated in late 2016, a strong dollar and\nan incoming Trump administration that will likely\npursue a US-centric policy toward China. Risks are\nexacerbated by the leadership’s lack of experience\nin handling financial market volatility, as evidenced\nby China’s policy response to its equity market\ncollapse in June 2015 and its approach to shifting\nthe currency regime to a more flexible one in\nAugust 2015 and January 2016. We expect the\ncurrency to depreciate about 7% in 2017; since\n4% is already priced in the forward markets, we\nexpect a return of about 3%. There is considerable\nscope for further upside from this tilt if China\nabandons its current control of the currency,\na move that could lead to depreciation in the\nrenminbi of about 20%.\nOur tactical tilts are based on above-trend growth\nof 2.3% in the US, global growth of 2.9%,\ngenerally favorable monetary policy and more\nstimulative fiscal policy across developed and\nemerging market countries. We expect returns to\nbe muted across asset classes, resulting in modest\nreturns in a diversified portfolio with a modest\nenhancement from tactical tilts. Of course, our\nviews are not without risks. As we discuss below,\nsome are low-probability risks with the potential\nfor high impact while others are high-probability\nrisks with low impact potential.\nThe Risks to Our Outlook\nWhen we think about the risks to our economic\nand financial market outlook, we are reminded of\nthe words of French writer Jean-Baptiste Alphonse\nKarr: Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose—the\nmore things change, the more they stay the same.\nThis year’s list of risks overlaps with those of the\nlast several years. As far back as 2011, investors\nhave worried about a hard landing in China. From\nthe inception of the European sovereign debt\ncrisis in 2010 through the Brexit vote in 2016, the\npotential breakup of the Eurozone has been a source\nof concern. As soon as the Federal Reserve raised\nthe federal funds rate in December 2015, investors\nworried about tightening policy causing a recession.\nCybersecurity and terrorism are constant threats.\nAnd geopolitical risks have grown over time. This\nyear, we are adding trade policy uncertainty and US-\nChina geopolitical relations as new risks.\nAs we said in our 2013 Outlook, there is no\nshortage of concerns as markets climb a wall\nof worry. In our view, there are eight risks that\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n25\nWe do not believe this tightening cycle will lead to a US recession in 2017.\ncould derail the last innings of this recovery and\nbull market. The first three are low-probability\nrisks in our view, the next three risks have a\nhigh probability of occurring but their impact is\nuncertain and the last two are high-probability and\nhigh-impact risks beginning as early as 2017.\nLow-Probability but High-Impact Risks:\n• The pace of Federal Reserve tightening\nis disruptive and financial markets\nreact negatively.\n• The economy slips into recession.\n• Populist parties in the Eurozone\ngain greater influence.\noffing. Interest rates have increased from\na low of 1.3% for the 10-year Treasury\nin July 2016 to 2.4% by year-end. While\nthis increase in interest rates would\nordinarily tighten financial conditions,\nit has been partially offset by stronger\nequity markets and tighter corporate\nbond spreads. In fact, financial conditions\nwere looser at the end of the year than\nthey were at the beginning of 2016\ndespite expectations of a slow but steady\nincrease in the federal funds rate.\nWe share the market view that the\npace of monetary policy tightening will\naccelerate but remain benign. As shown\nin Exhibit 23, the difference between\nthe Federal Reserve dots, the view implied by the\nbond market, the forecast by our colleagues in\nGIR and our view is negligible. The bond market\nhas priced two hikes, the Federal Reserve and GIR\nexpect three hikes, and we think two or three hikes\nare equally likely in 2017. We assume that the\nFederal Reserve will slow down the pace of interest\nHigh-Probability but Uncertain-Impact Risks:\n• Geopolitical hot spots get hotter.\n• Terrorism escalates.\n• Cyberattacks continue.\nHigh-Probability and High-Impact Risks:\n• China submerges under its debt burden and\ncapital outflows.\n• US-China relations deteriorate under the Trump\nadministration.\nPace of Federal Reserve Tightening\nUnlike the December 2015 interest rate hike that\nprompted a vocal response from naysayers but had\nlimited impact on the bond market, the December\n2016 hike has elicited a muted response from\nmarket commentators but has had a larger impact\non the bond market. The underlying strength of the\nlabor market and the steady improvement in the\neconomy have led to a change of sentiment toward\nmore interest rate hikes, which are clearly in the\nThere is no shortage of concerns as markets climb a wall of worry.\n26 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 23: Policy Rate Path Projections\nWe expect the pace of monetary policy tightening to\naccelerate but remain benign.\nFederal Funds Rate (%)\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\nISG View\nGIR View\nMarket Implied\nMedian Federal Reserve Projection\n1.4\n1.4\n1.3\n1.2\n0.0\nDec-16 Dec-17 Dec-18 Dec-19\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nNote: For informational purposes only.

Roosevelt\nMemorial. Art © The George and Helen Segal Foundation/Licensed by VAGA,\nNew York, NY.\n3.4\n2.9\n2.8\n2.0\nLow Expectations of a US Recession\nRecessions in the US have been triggered by\nFederal Reserve tightening of monetary policy; by\neconomic imbalances such as the bursting of the\ndot-com and housing bubbles in 2000 and 2008,\nrespectively; or by external shocks such as the Arab\noil embargo in 1973. The first two triggers are\nunlikely to occur in 2017, and the third, a shock,\nis not something that we can typically anticipate.\nHowever, we do think that China will be a\nsource of downside risk sometime over the next\nthree years.\nFirst, as we mentioned in last year’s Outlook,\nthere have been five tightening cycles in the post-\nWWII period that have not triggered a recession.\nFour of those cycles occurred during the three\nlongest recoveries, as shown in Exhibit 24. Those\ncycles have been characterized by an early start\nto the tightening cycle, a slow pace relative to\nhistorical averages (220 basis points per year for\nnonrecessionary tightening and 330 basis points per\nyear in recessionary cycles), low core inflation and\nslack in the labor market. This cycle shares those\ncharacteristics: the tightening cycle started in 2015,\nthe pace has been 25 basis points per year, the core\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) index—\nthe Federal Reserve’s preferred benchmark for\ninflation—is at 1.6% year over year as of November\n2016, and our colleagues in GIR estimate that the\nlabor market still has about 0.3% slack.\nSecond, the US economy does not\nsuffer from any imbalances in which one\nsector of the economy has become the\nsole driver of growth or equity market\nreturns. Before the global financial crisis,\nresidential investment as a percentage\nof GDP had peaked at 6.7% in 2005,\ncompared to a long-term average of\n4.7%, and the credit-to-GDP gap as a\nmeasure of nonfinancial sector leverage\nhad peaked at 12.4% in 2007 compared\nto a long-term average of -1%, leading\nto meaningful imbalances. Similarly, in\n2000, technology and telecommunication\nsector valuations were more than three\nstandard deviations higher than the\naverage of other sectors. Such imbalances\ndo not exist in the US at this time.\nThird, while we cannot anticipate an\nexternal shock—otherwise it would not\nbe a shock—we do not see imbalances in\nother large economies except in China.\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n27\nExhibit 24: US Real GDP During the Longest Post-WWII Recoveries\nFour of the five tightening cycles that did not trigger a recession occurred during the three longest recoveries in the\npost-WWII period.\nBeginning of Recovery = 100\n160\nMar-61\nDec-82\n150\nMar-91\nCurrent (Jun-09)\n140\nAug-61–Nov-66\nDid NOT Trigger\nRecession\nDec-86–Mar-89\nTriggered Recession\nCAGR: 4.4%\nAug-67–Aug-69\nTriggered Recession\nCAGR: 4.9%\nCAGR: 3.6%\n130\n120\nMar-83–Aug-84\nDid NOT Trigger\nRecession\nCAGR: 2.1%\nJun-99–Jul-00\nDid NOT Trigger\nRecession\n110\nDec-15–?\n100\n90\nFeb-94–Apr-95\nDid NOT Trigger\nRecession\nDenotes Beginning of Fed Tightening Cycle\nDenotes End of Fed Tightening Cycle\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40\nQuarters After Recession Trough\nData as of December 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg, National Bureau of Economic Research.\nIn our 2016 Outlook and our 2016 Insight report,\nWalled In: China’s Great Dilemma, we stated that\nChina was unlikely to have a hard landing over the\nnext two years (i.e., 2016 and 2017). We believe\nthe view still holds. We do not expect a hard\nlanding in China that would destabilize the US\neconomy in 2017, but the risks grow significantly\nin 2018 and 2019. As we discuss below, China may\nnevertheless represent a geopolitical risk in 2017.\nHistorically, since WWII, the odds of a\nrecession occurring over a 12-month period\nhave been 18%. Our composite recession model,\nincorporating end-of-year financial and economic\ndata, estimates the probability of a recession in\n2017 at 23%. Once we incorporate the likely\npassage of a fiscal stimulus package of tax cuts\nand infrastructure investments in the latter half\nof 2017, the probability of a recession this year\ndeclines to about 15%.\nRising Influence of Populist Parties in\nthe Eurozone\nSince the election of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\nand the Syriza Party in Greece in January 2015,\npopulism has been gaining momentum across\nEurope. The support for populist parties has\nincreased to varying degrees in Spain, Greece, Italy,\nFrance, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.\nThe common themes among populists have been\nanti-immigration and anti-European Union.\nOutside the Eurozone, the 2016 Brexit vote in\nGreat Britain has been interpreted as a populist\nvote against immigration from Eastern Europe, the\nMiddle East and North Africa, as well as against\nthe bureaucracy of the European Union.\nThe increasing enthusiasm for populist parties\nin Europe raises two questions. First, will any of\nthe more extremist parties win enough support to\nbreak away from the European Union? In France,\nfor example, upcoming elections in May 2017 are\nlikely to pit François Fillon of Les Républicains\nagainst Marine Le Pen of the far right Front\nNational. Le Pen has promised a referendum on\nwhether France should stay in the European Union,\nand, should she win, questions about the viability\nof the Eurozone will surface immediately. 56 While\npolls show Fillon well ahead of Le Pen, polls\nhave been wrong on the UK and Italian referenda\nand the US election. The Eurasia Group, for one,\nassigns a 30% probability to a Le Pen victory. 57\nSecond, to what extent will the rise of populism\ninfluence policies in the Eurozone? Here, Germany\nwill probably provide a litmus test. Chancellor\nAngela Merkel and her coalition government are\nlikely to respond to recent terrorist attacks there by\nproposing a stronger police and military presence,\naccording to the Eurasia Group. Security checks\nwill probably be increased as well, since at least\n800,000 asylum-seekers entered Germany with\nminimal security checks and terrorist suspects have\nalready been arrested among them. 58 With German\nelections scheduled for September 2017, it remains\nto be seen whether Chancellor Merkel will adjust\nher immigration policy.\n28 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nWhile populism is on the rise and the support\nfor such parties has increased, we do not think that\nthese movements will threaten the viability of the\nEurozone in 2017. In fact, in response to Brexit,\nwe believe that Eurozone policymakers will take a\nhard line with Britain to make sure other countries\ndo not think it realistic to manage an exit that\nretains all the benefits while shouldering none of\nthe costs.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the\n“Obama administration considers North Korea\nto be the top national security priority for the\nincoming administration.” 65 Nuclear weapons\nalready in place, long-range ballistic missile\ncapabilities in development, and an unpredictable\nand provocative leader are a deadly combination.\nNorth Korea will remain a serious risk for the\nforeseeable future.\nGeopolitical Hot Spots Get Hotter\nWe rely on the insights of external experts\nto formulate our geopolitical views. They\ninclude members of prominent research groups,\nthink tanks and universities as well as former\ngovernment officials, both in the US and abroad.\nSo informed, we highlight activity in North Korea,\nRussia and the Middle East among our group of\nrisks with high probability but uncertain impact.\nNorth Korean Belligerence Continues: North\nKorea’s unpredictable and belligerent military\nactivities have continued unabated. In early 2016,\nNorth Korea announced that it had tested its first\nhydrogen bomb. 59 By the end of 2016, North Korea\nhad conducted nine other military actions, including\nthe launch of a ballistic missile from a submarine, 60\nlaunches of long-range ballistic missiles toward\nJapan 61 and additional nuclear tests. 62\nWe can only expect further tests in 2017, given\nthe estimates by a Council on Foreign Relations\ntask force chaired by retired Admiral Michael\nMullen that North Korea may have between 13\nand 21 nuclear weapons as of June 2016. 63\nEven more troubling is a pattern highlighted by\nDavid Gordon, adjunct senior fellow at the Center\nfor a New American Security. Gordon points out\nthat North Korea makes a habit of testing new\npresidents, as it did in May 2009, early in President\nObama’s first term, and again in February 2013\nafter South Korean President Park Geun-hye was\ninaugurated. 64\nWhile populism is on the rise and\nthe support for such parties has\nincreased, we do not think that these\nmovements will threaten the viability\nof the Eurozone in 2017.\nRussian Adventurism Intensifies: While attention\nhas been focused on Russia’s adventurism in Syria,\nthe frozen conflict in Ukraine remains intact, with\nincreasing violations of the Minsk agreements\nof 2014 and 2015. 66 Since the first agreement\nin September 2014, nearly 10,000 people have\nbeen killed, 67 and most recently, Russian-backed\nseparatists attempted to break through Ukrainian\ngovernment lines. 68 In response to such lack of\nprogress and concerns about further Russian\naggression in the region, the heads of North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member\ncountries agreed, at a summit in Warsaw in\nJuly 2016, to deploy as many as 4,000 troops\nto the Baltic States and Poland in early 2017 as\na deterrent to further adventurism in Eastern\nEurope. 69 The risks of accidents and intentional\nskirmishes will inevitably rise.\nFurthermore, the direction of foreign policy\nin the region under a Trump administration is\nuncertain given President-elect Trump’s July 2016\nstatement that the US would not automatically\ndefend the Baltic States. 70\nRussia is likely to stay involved in the Middle\nEast as well. Russia has been a constructive force\nwith respect to the fight against the Islamic State of\nIraq and the Levant (ISIL) and a stabilizing force\nwith respect to keeping Syrian President Bashar\nal-Assad in place in the absence of any attractive\nalternatives. Syria would not have made as much\nprogress in pushing back ISIL and the rebels\nwithout Russian air power support. Russia has also\nhosted a meeting in Moscow with Iran\nand Turkey to work toward an accord\nto end the war in Syria 71 —a six-year war\nthat has resulted in 400,000 72 to 470,000\nfatalities 73 and an estimated economic\ncost of $250 billion to $275 billion. 74\nGiven the prospects of continued\ngeopolitical turmoil in the region,\nRussian involvement in the Middle East\nwill not be reduced anytime soon.\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n29\nMiddle East Conflicts and Tensions Persist: The\nMiddle East will remain a source of conflict for\nyears to come. Many countries have weak or\ncollapsing nation-state structures with varying\ndegrees of civil war. As Zalmay Khalilzad,\nformer ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and\nthe United Nations, and president of Gryphon\nPartners, wrote recently, “the national borders\ndevised by Western powers for Iraq and Syria, in\nparticular, are not standing up well to the test of\ntime … and Pakistan’s policies have contributed\nto Afghanistan’s precarious condition.” 75 Iran\nand Saudi Arabia compete for influence in the\nregion, and the Sunni-Shia divide that was not a\ngeopolitical factor 40 years ago will continue to\nescalate tensions in the region.\nAnother potential risk in the region is the\ndismantling of the Iran nuclear deal by the Trump\nadministration. 76 In the absence of a deal, Iran\nwould return to building its nuclear capabilities,\nthereby increasing the risks of a military strike by\nIsrael or the US.\nWe assign a low probability to such an event\nfor two reasons. First, we point to comments made\nby secretary of defense nominee retired General\nJames Mattis, which suggest a different approach\nin dealing with Iran. 77 In a speech in April 2016 at\nthe Center for Strategic and International Studies,\nMattis said “there is no going back” on the deal\n“absent a clear and present violation.” 78 Second,\nother signatories to the deal, including Russia and\nChina, would not support a unilateral dismantling\nof the deal by the new administration. 79 That is not\nto say that tensions between the US and Iran will\nnot continue this year.\nTurmoil in the region will continue into 2017\nand beyond. While the direct impact of such\nconflicts on global growth and world equity\nmarkets is limited outside a war among major\npowers, the threat posed by terrorism is significant\nand growing.\nTerrorism Escalates\nAnother high-probability but uncertain-impact\nrisk is increased terrorism. The Middle East has\nbeen the main source of terrorism even before the\nSeptember 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade\nCenter. The majority of the 9/11 perpetrators,\n15 out of 19, were from Saudi Arabia, with the\nrest from other Arab countries in the region. 80\nSince then, the spread of ISIL, the Syrian civil\nwar, extremism in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and\nthe immigration of Arabs and North Africans\nto Europe and, to a lesser extent, the US, have\nincreased the incidence of terrorism in the West.\nIn 2016, there were five key terrorist incidents\nin the US and 15 in Europe, including a December\n19 attack when a truck rammed into a Christmas\nmarket in Berlin. 81 Some of the terrorists\nresponsible were inspired by ISIL, 82 and some were\nlone-wolf Islamic extremists who had lived in their\nrespective countries for years. 83 With a growing\nnumber of refugees in Europe, it is highly likely\nthat this pace of terrorism will continue.\nTerrorist attacks and geopolitical tensions in\nthe Middle East take more than their immediate\nhuman toll. While consumer confidence in the\nUS is now above the pre-global financial crisis\npeak of July 2007 (see Exhibit 25), Gallup Poll\ndata shows that dissatisfaction remains at a very\nhigh level, similar to that at the beginning of\nthe global financial crisis. As shown in Exhibit\n26, the dissatisfaction rate increased steadily in\nthe aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and\nthe US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It had\nalready reached current levels before the global\nfinancial crisis.\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Ben\nBernanke has named traumatic national shocks\nsuch as 9/11 along with political polarization\nand “shrill” political debates as possible culprits\nof the contradictory signals between the high\nlevels of consumer confidence as measured by\nthe Conference Board and the high levels of\ndissatisfaction as measured by Gallup Polls. 84\nRisks of continued terrorism are very high,\nbut the broader economic impact of the type of\nterrorist acts we witnessed in 2016 is limited. We\ncan only hope that large attacks such as 9/11 do\nnot occur again.\nCyberattacks Continue\nHigh-profile cyberattacks or cyberattack\nannouncements were a regular feature of 2016.\nThe highest-profile attacks were those perpetrated\nby the Russian government on the Democratic\nNational Committee computer network, according\nto a joint statement from the Department of\nHomeland Security and Office of the Director\nof National Intelligence on Election Security. 85\nThe US government expelled 35 Russian officials\nand imposed sanctions on four high-ranking\nmembers of the Russian military intelligence unit\nas a result. 86\n30 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 25: Conference Board Consumer\nConfidence Index\nThe labor market recovery has led to a steady increase in\nconsumer confidence.\nIndex Points\n160\n140\nExhibit 26: Gallup Poll on Satisfaction With the\nDirection of the US\nDissatisfaction remains at a very high level, similar to that at\nthe beginning of the global financial crisis.\n% of Respondents\n100\n90\n120\n113.7\n80\n70\n71\n100\n91.5\n60\n80\n60\n75.1\n50\n40\nBeginning of Global\nFinancial Crisis\n40\n20\nConference Board Consumer Confidence\nHistorical Average\nPost-Global Financial Crisis Average\n30\n20\n10\nSeptember 11th\nWar in Iraq\nWar in Afghanistan\n0\n1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014\nData through December 2016.\nNote: Series starts in January 1978.

Any major\nslowdown or volatility across bond,\ncurrency and equity markets in China,\nincluding Hong Kong, would have major\nramifications for the rest of the world.\nWhile the US has limited direct\neconomic exposure to China—only 0.6%\nof exports as a share of GDP, 0.6%\nof bank assets and 0.7% of corporate\nprofits—any shocks in China will\nreverberate through US financial markets.\nAs shown earlier in Exhibit 18 on page\n19, US financial conditions tightened by\n118 basis points in the summer of 2015\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n31\nwhen China’s leadership intervened in the local\nequity markets and adjusted the trading band\naround the renminbi, and by 104 basis points in\nlate 2015 and early 2016 when the leadership\nchanged the reference currency from the dollar to a\nbasket of 13 currencies. If US financial conditions\nhad stayed at those levels for over a year, US\nGDP growth would have slowed by about one\npercentage point, all else being equal. Financial\nconditions are the mechanism by which shocks\nfrom China would have the most immediate\nimpact on key developed economies such as the US.\nAs mentioned above, one of the triggers of\nUS recessions has been economic imbalances.\nWhile we do not see such imbalances in the US,\nor in other major developed economies, at this\ntime, we see significant imbalances in China. Such\nimbalances have led to crises in other countries,\nand there is no reason to believe that they will not\nlead to a financial crisis in China. In our view, it is\nnot a question of if—it is only a question of when.\nThe biggest imbalance in China is the high level\nof debt relative to GDP. The Bank for International\nSettlements (BIS) has a series of early warning\nindicators. One of the more widely followed\nand reliable measures is the credit-to-GDP gap,\nmeasured as the total credit extended to the\nprivate nonfinancial sector as a percentage of GDP\ncompared with its long-term trend. As shown in\nExhibit 27, China breached the high-risk threshold\nin June 2012, when its credit-to-GDP gap rose\nabove the 10% level. At 30.1% as of March\n2016 (latest data available) and rising, China’s\ngap exceeds the 10% threshold by 20 percentage\npoints, levels previously seen in Spain before the\nEuropean sovereign debt crisis. Major developed\nand emerging market countries have experienced a\nfinancial crisis within three years of their credit-to-\nGDP gap exceeding 10%.\nIn our 2016 Outlook and our 2016 Insight\nreport, Walled In: China’s Great Dilemma, we\nstated that we did not expect a hard landing in\nChina over the next two years—2016 and 2017.\nWe continue to assign a low probability to a hard\nlanding in China in 2017. However, it is unlikely\nthat China can avoid a financial crisis over the\nnext three years. In prior years, we have pointed to\nChina’s high savings rate and government control\nof many aspects of the economy as reasons for\nits ability to avert a hard landing. However, the\ncountry’s debt levels have risen rapidly, the pace\nof capital outflows has picked up, and net foreign\nExhibit 27: Credit-to-GDP Gap Across Economies\nChina’s gap reached the high-risk threshold in June 2012 and\nhas continued to rise.\nCredit-to-GDP Gap (% of GDP)\n50\n30\n10\n-10\n-30\nHigh Risk\nUK\nElevated Risk\nEurozone\n-50\nUS\nJapan\nSpain\nChina\nRussia\n-70\n1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\nData through Q1 2016.\nNote: Estimates based on series of total credit to the private nonfinancial sector.

Keep\nin mind that even the US was not able to avert a\nfinancial crisis after its credit-to-GDP gap briefly\nbreached the 10% high-risk threshold in December\n2006 and peaked at 12.4% in December 2007.\nThe US has the highest GDP per capita of any\nmajor country in the world. The large countries\nthat come closest to the US on this score have\nGDP per capita levels that stand at about 70% of\nUS levels on a nominal basis and slightly higher\non a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. The US\ndollar is also the unquestioned reserve currency\nof the world; its reserve-currency status has only\nbeen fortified after the Eurozone sovereign debt\ncrisis and the British referendum for Brexit. Thus,\nthe US is able to access the excess savings of the\nentire world. The US also receives the largest share\nof world foreign direct investment flows, capturing\n14% of global flows between 2011 and 2015.\nThe US now accounts for 20% of the stock of all\nforeign direct investment. Yet, despite all these\nmajor advantages, it did not avert a financial crisis\nin 2008. It defies logic to assume that China will\nbe the one major country that avoids a financial\ncrisis and a hard landing when it does not enjoy\nsuch advantages. As we often say, stating that “this\n32 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 28: Total Foreign Currency Holdings of\nChina’s Official Sector\nIf the recent pace of decline continues, China’s reserves\ncould soon fall below the IMF’s adequacy threshold.\nUS$ billions\n5,000\n4,500\n4,000\n3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\nPBOC FX reserves\nOther official FX holdings\nScenario 1 (avg. pace since Aug-2015)\nScenario 2 (avg. pace in 2016)\n0\nJan-15 Jul-15 Jan-16 Jul-16 Jan-17 Jul-17\nData through November 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, CEIC, Bloomberg, IMF.\nIMF FX reserve threshold\n(without capital controls)\n2,800\n1,700\nIMF FX reserve threshold\n(with capital controls)\ntime is different” is extremely dangerous for the\ninvestment well-being of our clients’ portfolios.\nChina, in fact, faces greater risk of a financial\ncrisis because of growing capital outflows. An\nastounding $1.3 trillion of capital has flowed out\nof China since August 2015, when it broadened the\ntrading range for its currency against the US dollar.\nThe outflows averaged $64 billion per month in\n2016. At that pace, China’s total official foreign\ncurrency holdings could drop below the IMF’s\nreserve threshold of $2.8 trillion by mid-2017, as\nshown in Exhibit 28.\nOf course, China’s leadership has not stood on\nthe sidelines. Since September 2015, the People’s\nBank of China and the State Administration of\nForeign Exchange have introduced a series of\nmeasures to limit capital outflows. These measures\nhave included orders to financial institutions\nto carefully check and strengthen controls on\nall foreign exchange transactions 91 and strict\noversight of Chinese companies’ outward\ninvestment in overseas property, hotels, cinemas\nand the entertainment and sports industries. 92\nAccording to reports, leadership has also ordered\nincreased oversight of trade activities to make\nsure companies are not over-invoicing the value\nof their imports or under-invoicing the value of\ntheir exports as a means of circumventing capital\ncontrols. 93 Exports and imports are 20% and\n15%, respectively, of China’s GDP. It is virtually\nimpossible for China to halt capital flows in such\na porous economy without slowing GDP growth\nrates. Thus, China will not be able to completely\nstem outflows despite all its measures to slow the\npace as much as possible.\nIrrespective of the success of such capital\ncontrols, China’s growing debt problem poses\nsignificant risks to China’s growth\ntrajectory. We estimate that the risk\nof a hard landing is only about 25%\nin 2017 but will increase rapidly to\nabout 50% in 2018 and be closer to\n75% in 2019. Therefore, while China\nis not a near-term risk, there is a high\nprobability of an intermediate-term crisis\nthat will reverberate through financial\nmarkets. We also know that we cannot\nanticipate the exact timing of such crises,\nespecially given the uncertainty of how\nUS-China relations will unfold under a\nTrump administration.\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, China has installed\nanti-aircraft guns and other weapons systems on seven man-made islands in the\nSouth China Sea, including the Johnson Reef, shown above.\nMap data: Google, DigitalGlobe\nUS-China Relations Deteriorate Under\nthe Trump Administration\nThere is no doubt that US strategy\ntoward China will shift; the only\nquestion is when and how. There are\ntwo channels by which the Trump\nadministration could affect US-China\nrelations: trade and foreign policy.\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n33\nWe may see some fireworks in US-China relations during the Trump administration.\nWith respect to trade, President-elect Trump\ncan use any one of six US statutes, including the\nTrading with the Enemy Act of 1917 and the\nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act of\n1977, to shift trade policy. The latter two statutes\ngive him latitude to change foreign commerce\nwithout interference from Congress or the courts.\nPresident-elect Trump has advocated\nimposing tariffs and labeling China a “currency\nmanipulator.” While he has continued to\nthreaten tariffs of 45% on imports from China,\nthere is considerable uncertainty as to what\nhis administration will actually impose. If the\nUS and China engage in a full trade war, the\nPeterson Institute for International Economics has\nestimated a notable drag on US GDP growth over\nthree years. 94\nAny of these actions by the Trump\nadministration may provoke a strong reaction\nfrom China, including a sizable depreciation of the\nrenminbi. Such depreciation would certainly be\ndisruptive to financial markets.\nWith respect to foreign policy, many policy\nexperts have been calling for a change in strategy\ntoward China. In April 2015, the Council on\nForeign Relations published a special report on\nChina, suggesting that Washington needed “a\nnew grand strategy toward China that centers\non balancing the rise of Chinese power rather\nthan continuing to assist its ascendancy.” 95 The\nmilitarization of the seven artificial islands in the\nSouth China Sea (see image on page 33), according\nto the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies, 96\nwill only expedite such a shift in strategy.\nIf President-elect Trump’s actions to date,\nsuch as the telephone conversation with Taiwan\nPresident Tsai Ing-wen 97 and his response to the\nrecent Chinese seizure of a US Navy drone, 98 are\nany indication, we may see some fireworks in US-\nChina relations during the Trump administration.\n34 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nKey Takeaways\nAs we mentioned in last year’s Outlook, forecasting is difficult under the\nbest of circumstances but particularly so in the last innings of an eightyear-long\neconomic expansion and bull market. This year brings the\nadditional challenge of a new president whose policies are likely to follow an\nunconventional script.\nNevertheless, there are seven key takeaways from our 2017 Outlook:\n• Improving growth: We expect global economic activity to accelerate\nthis year, with modestly higher GDP growth rates in the US, Eurozone,\nJapan and many emerging market economies. We expect a small\nslowdown in China.\n• Low recession risk: Favorable monetary and fiscal policies substantially\nreduce the probability of a recession in key developed and emerging\nmarket countries.\n• Still accommodative monetary policy: US monetary conditions will still\nbe relatively easy because of the slow and steady pace of tightening of\nthe federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve. At the same time, other\ndeveloped central banks are still expanding their balance sheets.\n• Remain vigilant: Despite a favorable economic and policy backdrop, there\nis no shortage of global risks, including rising populism in Europe, growing\ngeopolitical tensions, the spread of terrorism and the proliferation of\nserious cyberattacks.\n• China concerns: China is the biggest source of uncertainty given its\ngrowing debt burden, accelerating capital outflows and potential for a\nnotable deterioration in the US-China relationship driven by changing US\ntrade and foreign policy toward China.\n• Stay invested: The collective impact of these various risks is not yet sizable\nenough to undermine our core view: that we are in a longer-than-normal\nUS recovery that supports equity returns, which are likely to exceed those\nof cash and bonds. Thus, we recommend staying invested in US equities\nwith some tactical tilts to US high yield bonds and European equities.\n• Modest returns: While we recommend clients remain invested, we\nhave modest return expectations.

In response, central banks around the world\nhave expanded their balance sheets by a staggering $12.5\ntrillion, 99 while fiscal austerity measures in the G-7 economies\nhave reduced the general government budget deficit from 10%\nof GDP to just 3.6% today.\nAlthough this mix of policies may have helped avoid a\nsecond Great Depression, it has fallen short of fostering a\nrobust economic recovery. According to the IMF, the nominal\nGDP of advanced economies has grown at just a 1.6%\nannualized pace in US dollar terms since its 2009 trough,\nmaking it among the slowest expansions on record. The\novert reliance on monetary policy has also had unintended\nconsequences. Persistently low interest rates have crippled\nbank profitability and penalized savers. Moreover, the boost\nthat low rates provide to stock prices primarily benefited a\nnarrow segment of the income distribution, exacerbating\ninequality concerns. Not surprisingly, populism has been on\nthe rise globally.\n36 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n37\nLast year witnessed a growing repudiation of\nthis status quo, evident in the surprise outcome\nof the UK and Italian referenda, as well as US\npresidential election. As we begin 2017, these\nwinds of change are gaining force. Central banks\nare acknowledging the often counterproductive\nimpact of ultra-easy monetary policy and\nshifting attention to the eventual withdrawal of\naccommodation. At the same time, the recovery\nin commodity prices and recent firming in global\ngrowth is shifting the focus from deflation to\nreflation. The same could be said of the increasing\nfocus on expansionary fiscal policy.\nWhile this change brings hope, it also carries\nrisk. In the US, fiscal stimulus arrives eight years\ninto an economic expansion that is already near\nfull employment, increasing the danger of the\neconomy overheating. Although the Federal\nReserve could respond by hastening the pace\nof rate hikes, it might overdo it. Similarly, an\noverzealous negotiating stance on existing trade\nrelationships or imposition of protectionist policies\nby the incoming US administration could staunch\nthe flow of trade—an outcome that would be\nparticularly damaging to emerging markets. And\nin Europe, a victory of the far right in the French\npresidential election could unleash fears about\nFrance exiting the European Union and endanger\nthe survival of the euro.\nStill, we do not yet accord a high enough\nprobability to these risks to alter our base case,\nwhich assumes these winds of change fill the sails\nof the ongoing global recovery, rather than capsize\nit (see Exhibit 29).\nExhibit 30: Duration of Post-WWII Expansions\nThis expansion is already the fourth-longest since WWII.\nRecovery Duration (Quarters)\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n40\n35\n31\n30\nMar-91 Feb-61 Nov-82 Jun-09 Nov-01 Mar-75 May-54 Nov-70 Apr-58 Jul-80\nBusiness Cycle Trough\nData as of December 2016.\nNote: The recovery is measured from the business cycle trough.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, National Bureau of Economic Research.\nUnited States: Age Is Just a Number\n24\nThe US economic expansion is getting old by\nhistorical standards.

The depth of the financial\ncrisis and the lackluster pace of the recovery have\nallowed the US to avoid the imbalances that would\ntypically be evident this far into an expansion (see\nSection I of this year’s Outlook). If anything, there\nis scope for spending in cyclical parts of the US\neconomy relative to overall GDP to move toward\nits long-term average (see Exhibit 31).\nThere is also less risk of disruptive Federal\nReserve tightening, given how few signs we see\nof economic overheating. Headline inflation\nremains below the Federal Reserve’s 2.0% target,\nand though we expect it to move higher this year,\nnormalizing energy prices are a key driver (see\nExhibit 32). Further, while the November 2016\nunemployment rate of 4.6% suggests the economy\nis near full employment, broader measures of labor\nslack, as well as today’s depressed labor force\nparticipation rate, argue that the central bank is\nnot “behind the curve” (see Exhibit 33). Lastly,\nour expectation for continued modest gains for the\nUS dollar and a rebound in productivity growth\nfrom generational lows (see Exhibit 34) provides a\nnatural offset to inflation pressures, even as wages\ncontinue to rise.\nExhibit 33: US Unemployment Indicators\nThere are still signs of slack in the labor market.\n%\n14\nOverall Employment Population Ratio (Right, Inverted)\nUnemployment Rate\n%\n55\n12\nNatural Rate of Unemployment*\n57\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n1985 1988 1991 1994 1997 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015\nData through November 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Federal Reserve Economic Data, Datastream.\n* Long-term rate.\nOf equal importance, the Federal Reserve is\nacutely aware of the risks that tighter monetary\npolicy poses to the business cycle, which is\napparent in both its willingness to step back\nfrom planned rate hikes last year as well as\nChair Yellen’s acknowledgment that an “abrupt\ntightening would risk disrupting financial markets\nand perhaps even inadvertently push the economy\ninto recession.” 101 With neutral real interest rates\n59\n61\n63\n65\n67\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n39\nExhibit 34: US GDP per Hour Worked\nWe expect a rebound in productivity growth from\ngenerational lows.\n% YoY\n4\nExhibit 35: Goldman Sachs US Current\nActivity Indicator\nEconomic activity accelerated in the second half of 2016.\nAnnualized % Change\n3.0\n3\n2.5\n2.5\n2\n2.0\n1.5\n1.6\n2.1\n1\n0.6\n1.0\n0\n0.5\n-1\n1971 1975 1979 1983 1987 1991 1995 1999 2003 2007 2011 2015\n0.0\nAverage: January–May Average: June–November November Reading\nData through 2015.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, OECD.\nData as of November 2016.\nNote: The current activity indicator is the first principal component of real-activity indicators,\nexpressed in GDP-equivalent units.

With none of\nthe typical signs of economic contractions flashing\nred, we accord a 15% probability of a recession in\n2017, roughly in line with historical average risk.\nAgainst this backdrop, we expect US real GDP\ngrowth to accelerate from last year’s moderate\n1.6% pace, reaching 1.9–2.7% in 2017. There are\nthree key drivers to this story: fading headwinds,\na resilient US consumer and supportive policy. We\ndiscuss each below.\nFading Headwinds\nThe combination of falling oil prices and a\nrising dollar that began in mid-2014 has been a\nmeaningful drag on US growth, with energy-related\ncapital spending falling by more than 60% over\nthis period. In addition, exports have softened,\nthe S&P 500 has suffered almost two years of\ncontracting profits, and inventories throughout the\nsupply chain have ballooned as activity has slowed.\nSuch broad-based weakness has rarely\noccurred outside a recession.\nThe silver lining to last year’s\nslowdown, however, is that growth is\nnow poised to improve from depressed\nlevels. A modest recovery in oil prices\nand stabilization of the dollar enabled\nUS economic activity to accelerate\nnotably in the second half of last year\n(see Exhibit 35). This boost will be aided\n40 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 36: Contribution from Change in\nInventories to US GDP Growth\nInventories should support growth after five quarters of\nsubtracting from GDP.\nExhibit 37: National Association of Home Builders\nUS Housing Market Index\nThe post-crisis high in builder confidence bodes well for US\nresidential investment.\nPercentage Points, 5-Quarter Moving Total\nContribution\nRecession\nIndex Level\n14\n80\n10\n6\n70\n60\n50\n70\n2\n40\n-2\n-6\n30\n20\n10\n-10\n1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 2011 2016\n0\n2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\nData through Q3 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Haver Analytics.\nData through December 2016.\nNote: Based on a monthly survey of NAHB members who rate market conditions for the sale of\nnew homes, as well as the traffic of prospective buyers of new homes.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream.\nExhibit 38: US GDP Growth Impulse from\nGoldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index\nThe persistent drag from tight financial conditions over the\nlast two years should reverse in 2017.\nPercentage Points, 4-Quarter Moving Average\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1.0\nForecast\n-1.2\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nData as of Q3 2016.\nNote: The financial conditions index is a weighted average of riskless interest rates, credit\nspreads, equities and FX, based on effects on 1-year forward US GDP growth.

Similarly, residential\ninvestment is set to contribute, reflected in the\nNational Association of Home Builders (NAHB)\nhousing market index reaching a post-crisis high in\nDecember of last year (see Exhibit 37). Overall, we\nexpect this momentum to continue as the erstwhile\neasing in financial conditions provides a growth\ntailwind throughout 2017 (see Exhibit 38).\nA Resilient US Consumer\nThe stars are aligned for US consumers in 2017,\nas they enter the year with rising wages, higher\nnet worth from asset price gains, historically\nlow debt-servicing costs, ample savings and\nconfidence at a 12-year high. They also stand to\nbenefit directly from potentially lower tax rates\nand indirectly from higher fiscal spending, a\ntopic we discuss in the next section. The abovementioned\nfactors should mitigate the headwind\nfrom higher inflation. Overall, we expect private\nconsumption—a key driver of our GDP forecast—\nto expand at a pace of approximately 2.5%.\nSupportive Policy\nWhile government policy is always a source of\nuncertainty, it is even more so in 2017 given\npotential changes to tax, trade and immigration\npolicies in the wake of last year’s presidential\nelection. Nonetheless, our base case is that policy\nultimately supports growth this year, with some\nfiscal expansion and a measured pace of Federal\nReserve rate hikes.

But far from showing\nits age, the US economy begins 2017 at an abovetrend\ngrowth pace, with little evidence of cyclical\nimbalances or other excesses that typically portend\nthe end of the business cycle. If anything, the slow\npace of this recovery has elongated its life span, a\ndynamic that is likely to persist this year. Perhaps\nin macroeconomics, as in life, age is just a number.\nEurozone: Weathering the Storm\nThe Eurozone has faced its share of challenges in\nrecent years. Not only did it relapse into recession\nin 2011, but it also endured a domestic sovereign\nbond and banking crisis at the same time. More\nrecently, it has been buffeted by a spate of tragic\nterrorist attacks, an immigration crisis, the Brexit\nvote, a failed Italian constitutional referendum\nand renewed concerns about the solvency of its\nbanking system.\nYet despite this onslaught of headwinds, the\nreal economy has been remarkably stable in the\nlast two years. That fact is evident in Exhibit 40,\nwhich shows real GDP growth has sustained an\nabove-trend pace over this period, an outcome\nthat clearly exceeded consensus forecasts. Business\nsentiment has remained equally steadfast over this\nperiod, suggesting that the rapidity of shocks may\nhave effectively inured confidence to bad news (see\nExhibit 41). Meanwhile, real household disposable\nincome grew by 2.3% over the past year—the\nfastest pace since 2007.\nWe expect this stability to persist in 2017,\nwith our forecast calling for 1.2–1.9% real GDP\ngrowth. Keep in mind that there is ample scope\nfor above-trend growth to continue, as the level\nof Eurozone GDP still stands below its potential.\nOn this point, the OECD, IMF and European\nCommission each currently estimate an output gap\nof around 2%, indicating slack in the economy.\nThe Eurozone’s still elevated 9.8% unemployment\nrate corroborates this point.\n42 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 41: European Commission Industrial\nConfidence Survey\nEurozone business sentiment has remained steady despite\nrecent shocks, including Brexit.\nExhibit 42: Drivers of Eurozone 2-Year Capital\nSpending Plans\nKey factors that influence business investment stand at their\nhighest levels in years.\nIndex Level\n10\n0\n-10\n-1.1\n-6.0\nZ-Score\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n0.4\n0.7\n0.5\n0.8\n1.1\n0.8\n-20\n0.2\n-30\n-40\nIndustrial Confidence\nAverage Since 1985\n-50\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n0.0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-0.1\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.2\n-0.2\n-0.6\nExpected Demand Financial Conditions Technical Factors*\nData through November 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream.\nData through 2016.\nNote: Based on the European Commission investment survey.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream.\n* Technical factors include technological developments, the availability of labor and government\nincentives to invest.\nAs a result, Eurozone policy is likely to remain\naccommodative, keeping financial conditions\nsupportive of growth. While we expect the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) to gradually shift\nto a more neutral stance that is less punitive to\nbank profitability and acknowledges the uptrend\nin headline inflation, this shift does not imply the\nremoval of accommodation. Indeed, the ECB has\nalready announced an extension of quantitative\neasing through December 2017. Meanwhile, the\nEuropean Commission has endorsed a moderate\nfiscal easing of 0.5% of GDP for the Eurozone.\nGiven that fiscal policy is typically loosened ahead\nof major elections, this guidance could soon be\nembraced in France and Germany.\nOf equal importance, both consumption and\nbusiness investment are well positioned as we enter\n2017. On the former, continued improvement in\nthe labor market and ongoing GDP growth should\nOngoing uncertainty regarding Brexit,\nthe banking sector and upcoming\nelections remains a potential\ndownside risk.\nencourage consumers to spend a bit from their\nprecautionary savings, particularly given today’s\nrelatively high savings rate. At the same time, the\nfundamental justifications for increased business\nspending, such as higher demand and easy credit\nconditions, stand at their best levels in years (see\nExhibit 42). Perhaps not surprisingly, a late 2016\nsurvey of manufacturing firms revealed their\ninvestment intentions stood at all-time highs. 103\nOf course, ongoing uncertainty regarding\nBrexit, the banking sector and upcoming elections\nremains a potential downside risk, particularly\nfor an investment recovery. As a result, we\nacknowledge a greater-than-normal range of\npotential outcomes, both positive and negative. For\nexample, the victory of the far right in the French\npresidential election could unleash fears about\nFrance exiting the European Union and endanger\nthe survival of the euro, while the new government\nin Italy could speed up the long-overdue\nresolution of the banking sector’s\nproblems and change the electoral law to\nreduce political uncertainties.\nFor now, our base case assumes\nthat Italy will avoid a populist party in\ngovernment and that a centrist candidate\nwill win the French presidential election.\nThus, we expect the Eurozone to again\nweather the storm in 2017.\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n43\nExhibit 43: Japan Consumer Prices\nCore inflation and inflation expectations remain low.\n% YoY\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\nCore Inflation*\nExpectations of Average Inflation Over Following 10 Years**\nBOJ Inflation Target\n-1.0\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nData through November 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream, QUICK Bond Investors Survey.\n* Core inflation excludes fresh food and VAT impact.\n** Based on the QUICK Bond Investors Survey.\nUnited Kingdom: A Fork in the Road\nMuch like the Eurozone, the UK economy is\nnotable for its resilience, evident in 15 consecutive\nquarters of positive quarterly growth averaging\n2.5% annualized. This streak is even more\nimpressive considering last year’s Brexit vote and\nthe resulting consensus view that the UK was\ndestined for recession. Although the 20% decline\nin the trade-weighted sterling and rapid easing\nby the Bank of England were no doubt pivotal in\navoiding that fate, the immediate impact of the\nBrexit referendum has been far less destructive\nthan feared.\nBut as we begin 2017, the UK is rapidly\napproaching a fork in the road. The government\nmust choose which path Brexit will take once it\ntriggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which\nformally sets the process of the UK exit in motion.\nHere, the government’s current objectives—limiting\nfreedom of movement into the UK while retaining\nfull access to the European Union’s single market—\nUK authorities will have little room\nto cushion a downturn given today’s\nlarge fiscal deficits and already highly\naccommodative central bank.\n2.0\n0.9\n-0.4\nseem mutually exclusive and likely to engender a\npolitically charged negotiation process. This road\nis made all the more dangerous by the fact that\nUK authorities will have little room to cushion a\ndownturn given today’s large fiscal deficits and\nalready highly accommodative central bank.\nOf course, a softer stance on the issues is also a\npossible path, one that could elongate the effective\ntransitional period beyond two years and lead to a\nfar more benign outcome for the UK.\nThe uncertainty around the government’s\nultimate choices significantly increases the range of\nGDP outcomes in the medium term. Our current\nbase case assumes GDP will expand by 0.5–1.5%\nin 2017. This notable slowdown from last year’s\n2% pace reflects the likelihood that both hiring\nand investment activity will become more cautious\nonce the Brexit negotiations start. Even worse, this\nslowdown arrives just as consumer price inflation\nis accelerating from past sterling depreciation,\ncreating a lower growth/higher inflation backdrop\nthat is set to erode real income growth. For these\nreasons, the risks to our central case are skewed to\nthe downside.\nThat said, the fate of the UK economy is not\npreordained, even after the government chooses\nits path. As with any other negotiation, the result\nwill ultimately reflect the reasonableness of the\nparties, the concessions of both parties and how\nthe discussions evolve over time. Or in the words\nof golf legend Arnold Palmer: “The road to success\nis always under construction.” 104\nJapan: Same Battle, Different Year\nFor Japan, the decades-long battle against deflation\nnever seems to end. Despite two years of abovetrend\nGDP growth, including last year’s 1% gain,\ncore inflation remains negative, having fallen 0.4%\nin 2016 (see Exhibit 43). This comes despite a tight\nlabor market and record profits that should have\nencouraged companies to increase base\nwages. These already muted inflationary\npressures were exacerbated by low\nenergy prices and the appreciation of\nthe yen, once again pushing the Bank\nof Japan’s (BOJ’s) 2% inflation target\nfurther into the future.\nBut far from waving the white flag,\nJapan’s policymakers responded with\na range of bold measures, including a\n44 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 44: Emerging Market GDP Growth\nWe expect growth roughly in line with potential.\n% YoY (PPP Weighted)\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\nActual GDP\nPotential GDP\nForecast\n4.6\nThese pro-growth policies, coupled with less\nslack in the economy and a boost from higher\nenergy prices and past yen appreciation, should\nenable core inflation (excluding fresh food) to\nreach our expected range of 0.25–1.0%.

First, the fiscal stimulus announced in\nAugust is poised to contribute 0.4 percentage point\nto 2017 GDP growth, and the government has\nindicated a willingness to do more if necessary.\nSecond, the BOJ remains very accommodative,\nthereby providing easy financial conditions that\nshould foster an uptick in business investment.\nWhile the central bank may consider a modest\nrate increase in late 2017, we expect it to maintain\nits negative interest rate policy (NIRP) for short\nrates and a 0% target for 10-year JGB yields in the\ninterim. Lastly, the government is likely to push\nfor further wage increases during the spring wage\nnegotiations.\nEmerging market economies failed to live up\nto expectations once again in 2016, with GDP\nexpanding by an estimated 3.9% versus original\nexpectations closer to 5.0%. This marked the\nsecond-slowest growth rate in 15 years; only the\n2.6% expansion at the depth of the global financial\ncrisis in 2009 was slower. Yet this disappointing\nheadline belies the economic recovery that\nunfolded over the course of 2016. Consider that\ngrowth actually troughed during a challenging\nfirst quarter, with economic activity gradually\nimproving thereafter on the back of recovering\ncommodity prices, the Federal Reserve’s willingness\nto delay any further rate hikes and stable Chinese\ngrowth. These tailwinds were bolstered into the\nfinal quarter by early signs of recovery in Brazil\nand Russia, both of which had suffered deep\nrecessions in 2015.\nWe expect this momentum to persist, with GDP\nincreasing by 4.3–4.8% (purchasing power parity\n[PPP] weighted) this year, roughly in line with\npotential (see Exhibit 44). The pickup we expect\nis the product of two opposing forces. On the one\nhand, growth should benefit from the ongoing\nrecoveries in Brazil and Russia, and somewhat\nstronger activity in developed economies should\nprovide a small tailwind to emerging market\nexports. On the other hand, the further moderation\nin Chinese growth we expect is likely to weigh on\nactivity across emerging markets, particularly if the\nUS imposes tariffs.\nIndeed, the policy agenda of the incoming US\nadministration remains a critical unknown for\nemerging markets. Even if protectionist tariffs\nwere directed only at China and Mexico—which\naccount for 23% and 15% of US imports of\nmanufactured goods, respectively—they would still\nnegatively impact all emerging markets given the\nsensitivity of these countries to Chinese growth and\nfluctuations in the Chinese currency. This being the\ncase, countries with substantial trade exposure to\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n45\nExhibit 45: China Economic Activity Measures\nActual growth is likely lower than official figures.\n% YoY, 3-Month Moving Average\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\nReal GDP Growth\n2\nEmerging Advisors Group China Activity Index\nGoldman Sachs China Activity Indicator\n0\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\nData through Q3 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Emerging Advisors Group, Goldman Sachs Global\nInvestment Research.\nboth China and the US, such as Korea, Taiwan and\nMalaysia, would be particularly vulnerable.\nWhile the net effect of these competing forces\nis positive in our base case, the risks are tilted to\nthe downside.\nChina\nChina continues to drive its economy with\none foot on the gas pedal and the other on the\nbrake. Consider that the government reached its\nofficial GDP growth target of 6.5–7% last year\nonly by increasing public spending and allowing\nrampant credit growth. But these measures also\nexacerbated real estate bubble concerns and\nhastened capital outflows, forcing the government\nto apply the brakes through new restrictions within\nthe property market and more stringent capital\ncontrols. This focus on dual-footed driving has also\ncome at the expense of much-needed structural\nreforms. As a result, China continues to suffer from\nconsiderable excess capacity in industrial sectors,\nsuch as steel and coal, while its financial sector\nrisks have increased.\nEven so, we expect this approach to continue\nin 2017. Structural reforms are likely to stay\non the back burner because China’s leaders\nwill not risk slower growth ahead of important\nleadership changes at the 19th Communist Party\nof China National Congress in the fall. In turn,\nthe government is likely to use further fiscal easing\nand rapid credit expansion to target growth of\naround 6.5%. As a result, we expect official GDP\n6.7\n5.6\n4.8\nto expand by 6.0–6.75% in 2017, although actual\nGDP growth will likely be lower (see Exhibit 45).\nThe risks to our outlook are skewed to the\ndownside for two reasons. First, the new direction\nof US trade policy remains uncertain and could\nhave a sizable impact. For instance, a 15% tariff\nwould mechanically reduce China’s GDP by 0.9%.\nChina could respond by ramping up leverage,\nletting its currency depreciate faster and injecting\nmore fiscal stimulus, but that could risk further\nimbalances in the economy while also disrupting\nglobal financial markets. Second, striking the right\nbalance between stimulative and contractionary\nmeasures is a hazardous endeavor. On the road,\nas in government policy, accelerating and braking\nat the same time greatly increases the risk of\nan accident.\nIndia\nIndia’s streak of strong growth continues. The\neconomy expanded by an estimated 6.5% in\n2016, making it the fourth consecutive year of\nGDP growth in excess of 6.0%, a rare feat that\nIndia’s economy shares only with China’s. Growth\nwould likely have been even higher, were it not\nfor the “demonetization” scheme the government\nintroduced in November 2016. In a surprise\nmove, the government announced that largedenomination\nbank notes, representing 86% of\ncash in circulation, would no longer be accepted\nas legal tender. The scheme—intended to root out\nillegal income stored in cash—had the unfortunate\nside effect of starving households of liquidity and\nthereby thwarting consumption, the main engine of\ngrowth. Although the severity of the consumption\nshock remains uncertain, it should be temporary.\nThe silver lining for 2017 is that India will\nprobably benefit from a meaningful recovery in\nhousehold spending. Moreover, fiscal policy will\nlikely be eased ahead of the 15 state elections\noccurring in 2017 and 2018, while investment\nshould receive a modest boost as the Reserve Bank\nof India lowers borrowing costs. Accordingly, we\nexpect GDP growth of 6.5–7.5% in 2017.\n46 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nChina continues to suffer from\nconsiderable excess capacity in\nindustrial sectors, such as steel and\ncoal, while its financial sector risks\nhave increased.\nBrazil\nBrazil has had its share of hard times in recent\nyears. After being among the fastest-growing\neconomies in the world in 2010, it has more\nrecently suffered its worst recession in a\ncentury, evident in seven consecutive quarters of\ncontraction. In turn, GDP fell an estimated 3.3%\nlast year, leaving it on par with 2010 levels. Even\nworse, industrial production now stands where it\ndid in 2004.\nFortunately, there are already tentative signs\nof a recovery. Inflation has peaked; the current\naccount deficit has shrunk; and confidence\nindicators, while still weak, have stabilized. Of\nequal importance, the financial markets have\nwelcomed a new government amid expectations\nthat it will finally tackle Brazil’s fiscal problems\nand steer the economy out of recession.\nBut despite these promising green shoots,\nour base case does not call for a robust recovery\nin 2017. While the new administration is off to\na promising start, it is facing resistance to key\nstructural reforms while also navigating ongoing\ncorruption probes. Moreover, the recovery in\nhousehold consumption and business investment\nis likely to be hamstrung by continuing high real\ninterest rates, a function of falling inflation and a\nsimultaneously easing central bank. Meanwhile,\nfiscal policy will continue to tighten given a\nnew spending cap and proposed pension reform\nmeasures. Finally, the modest commodity price\ngains we expect are unlikely to foster a meaningful\nrise in exports for Brazil. Accordingly, we expect\na tepid recovery, with GDP expanding just\n0–1% in 2017.\nRussia\nRussia is also slowly recovering from a\ndeep recession. Although the economy\ncontracted for its second consecutive year\nin 2016, headwinds are now receding\nthanks to a recovery in real wages,\nrising oil prices and a related increase in\noil production. The economy has also\nreceived support from both fiscal and\nmonetary policy, with the central bank\ncutting the policy rate by 100 basis points last\nyear as inflation moderated. Still, the economy has\nlikely suffered some permanent damage from the\ncombination of depressed oil prices and Western\nsanctions, which have pushed down Russia’s longrun\ngrowth potential.\nWhile the cyclical recovery should continue in\n2017, it is apt to be measured. The government is\nplanning to reduce the fiscal deficit by 1% of GDP\nthis year, which will limit fiscal support. That said,\nelections in March 2018 could ultimately temper\nsuch fiscal prudence. Meanwhile, the central bank\nwill likely deliver more rate cuts, but their size and\npace will depend on the path of inflation, which\ncould be stickier than anticipated.\nAgainst this uncertain backdrop, we expect the\nRussian economy to return to modest growth in\n2017, expanding 0.5–1.5%. While not our base\ncase, growth could quicken if oil prices increase\nmore than we expect or if sanctions are lifted.\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n47\nSECTION III\n2017 Financial Markets\nOutlook: The Horns of\na Dilemma\ninvestors have had an amazing bull run. Including last\nyear’s 12% total return, the S&P 500 is nearly 3.5 times as high\nas its financial crisis trough. The advance has been equally longlasting,\nsecond in length only to the almost-decade-long period\nthat preceded the technology bubble in 2000. These impressive\ngains are not limited to just equities or US assets. US corporate\nhigh yield has gained 177% over the same time span, while the\ntotal return of the MSCI All Country World Index excluding\nthe United States has been higher only 5% of the time over\ncomparable eight-year periods since 1994.\nBut as we begin a new year, these gains have left investors\non the horns of a dilemma. Put simply, they must now choose\nto either remain invested at high valuations and bear the\nassociated risk of loss or exit the market and forgo the potential\nfor upside surprises as well as returns that are attractive\ncompared to the alternatives.\n48 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n49\nTo be sure, there are good reasons to be\ncautious, as we discussed in Section I, The Risks to\nOur Outlook. Even worse, investors are exposed to\nthese dangers at a time when most asset valuations\nare expensive by historical standards, providing\nthem with a narrow margin of safety to absorb\nsuch adverse developments. This is particularly\ntrue in the US, where valuations have been cheaper\nat least 90% of the time historically. 105 Even in\nEurope, where valuations are more attractive, that\nfact is counterbalanced by greater geopolitical risks\nand deeper structural fault lines.\nStill, as we highlighted in Section I of this\nOutlook, there are three reasons why remaining\ninvested in risk assets is still warranted despite\nwhat are likely to be uninspiring returns. First,\nwe see only a 15% probability of a US recession,\nwhich has historically been the key driver of\nlosses in risk assets. Indeed, the S&P 500 has\ngenerated positive annual total returns 86% of\nthe time during economic expansions in the post-\nWWII period. Second, the comparable returns\nof investment alternatives—such as cash and\nbonds—are unappealing, particularly in the rising\ninterest rate environment that we expect. Third,\nrisk assets can surprise us to the upside, as last year\ndemonstrated. The potential for returns to exceed\nour expectations is especially true in the US, given\nthe possibility of tax reforms, fiscal expansion\nand deregulation. The same could be said for\nour tactical positions across various asset classes,\nwhich we discussed in Section I, Our Tactical Tilts.\nWhile we have suggested that the dilemma\nshould be resolved in favor of remaining invested,\nwe are not Pollyannaish. Investors have ridden\nthis bull market for eight years, and while we\ndon’t expect the ride to end in 2017, we must stay\nvigilant to avoid the horns.\nExhibit 47: US Equity Price Returns from Each\nValuation Decile\nIn the past, subsequent returns from high valuation levels\nhave been muted.\n% Annualized\n5-Year Annualized Price Return\n%\n14\n13.0\n% Observations With Positive Returns (Right) 100\n90\n12\n11.2\n80\n10\n9.5\n70\n8\n8.3\n7.0\n6.6 6.6\n7.1\n60\n50\n6\n4.5\n40\n4\n30\n2\n0\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nLess Expensive\nValuation\nDecile\nMore Expensive\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nNote: Based on 5 valuation metrics for the S&P 500, beginning in September 1945: Price/Trend\nEarnings, Price/Peak Earnings, Price/Trailing 12m Earnings, Shiller Cyclically Adjusted Price/\nEarnings Ratio (CAPE) and Price/10-Year Average Earnings.

Moreover, valuations now stand in their\n10th decile, indicating they have been cheaper\nat least 90% of the time historically. In the past,\nstarting from such a high base has led to muted\nequity returns over the subsequent five years, with\nonly a third of those episodes generating a profit\n(see Exhibit 47).\nEven so, high valuations should not be\nconfused with certainty of loss, especially over\nshort periods. As seen in Exhibit 48, today’s\nequity multiples tell us very little about potential\ngains over the next year, explaining only 5% of\ntheir variation historically. Moreover, history\nteaches us that a strategy of selling equities based\nsolely on expensive valuations has been a losing\napproach over time. As we noted in our 2014\nOutlook, research conducted by three professors\nat the London Business School concluded that\nInvestors have ridden this bull market\nfor eight years, and while we don’t\nexpect the ride to end in 2017, we\nmust stay vigilant to avoid the horns.\nunderweighting equities based exclusively on high\nvaluations underperformed a strategy of remaining\ninvested across every one of the 20 countries and\nthree country aggregates they examined. 106 In\nshort, valuations alone are a poor tactical timing\nsignal. Indeed, the S&P 500 has returned more\nthan 36% since first entering its 9th valuation\ndecile in November 2013, a time when many\nwere already suggesting that US equities were\nin a bubble.\nValuations must also be considered in\nthe context of the prevailing macroeconomic\nenvironment. Consider that periods of low and\nstable inflation, such as we expect for the year\nahead, have supported higher valuations in the past\n(see Exhibit 49). The same could be said for lower\ntaxes and deregulation—were they to materialize\nlater this year—as both would boost real returns\non invested capital and justify higher equity values.\nSimilarly, today’s structurally lower interest rates—\nreflecting slower population and productivity\ngrowth—reduce the rate at which\nall future cash flows are discounted,\nincreasing their present value.\nHere, it’s helpful to remember that the\nS&P 500’s long-term average P/E ratio—\nwhich many investors use to gauge\nfair value—was forged over a period\nwhen risk-free rates averaged 4.5%. In\ncontrast, the risk-free rate now is just\n0.5–0.75% and the Federal Reserve\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n51\nExhibit 51: ISM Manufacturing Index and S&P\n500 Returns\nEquity market performance is closely related to the\nbusiness cycle.\nIndex\n65\n% YoY\n60\nExhibit 52: Estimated Incremental S&P 500\nEarnings per Share by Tax Rate\nProposals for lower corporate tax rates could lead to\nhigher earnings.\nIncremental EPS ($)\n16\n60\n55\n50\n40\n20\n0\n14\n12\n10\n8\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n45\n40\n-20\n6\n4\n3\n5\n6\n35\nISM Manufacturing Index\nS&P 500 Return (Right)\n30\n1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\n-40\n-60\n2\n0\n30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20\nUS Effective Tax Rate (%)\nData through November 30, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nNote: The current US effective tax rate for the S&P 500 companies is 33.3%.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Standard & Poor’s.\nestimates its new long-run equilibrium level has\nfallen to 3%, a full 1.5 percentage points below\nthe historical average. 107 Of equal importance, the\nFederal Reserve is not expected to reach that 3%\ntarget for six years based on current market pricing\nin Eurodollar futures.\nA similar valuation tailwind emerges from the\nmarket’s current sector composition. The combined\ntechnology and health-care sectors constitute about\n40% of S&P 500 earnings today, almost three\ntimes as high as their 15% share in the late 1980s.\nBecause these faster-growing, higher-margin sectors\nare generally accorded premium valuations, their\nhigher representation in the index today justifies a\nhigher S&P 500 P/E multiple.\nAlthough current valuations may be\nfundamentally justified, that does not mean\nthey are impervious to downward pressure. Our\ncentral-case equity view for 2017 acknowledges\nthis, calling for some contraction in P/E multiples\ngiven the uncertainty associated with a new\nadministration and continued Federal Reserve\ninterest rate hikes. Even so, that headwind will be\nmore than offset by the 6–10% earnings growth\nwe forecast, resulting in a 1–5% total return for US\nequities this year (see Exhibit 50).\nInvestors might rightly ask whether it is worth\nbearing equity risk for such meager returns.

The state of the business cycle is a\nkey driver of market performance, evident in the\ntight linkage between the S&P 500 and the ISM\nManufacturing Index (see Exhibit 51). Notably, the\nS&P 500 has generated positive annual total returns\n86% of the time during economic expansions in the\npost-WWII period, while suffering annual declines\nof greater than 10% just 4% of the time. During\nthe same postwar period, nearly three-fourths of the\nbear markets—defined here as declines of 20% or\nmore—occurred during US recessions.\nWith few signs of an economic contraction\non the horizon, the high odds of positive returns\nand low odds of large losses raise the hurdle\nfor underweighting equities significantly. This is\nparticularly true because the risks are not onesided:\nmarkets often surprise to the upside, too,\neven at high valuations. Last year was a case in\npoint: the S&P 500’s 12% return matched our\ngood-case scenario, although at the start of 2016\nwe had attached only 20% odds to it occurring.\nAs we consider the potential for similar upside\nsurprises in 2017, earnings growth tops the list for\nthree reasons. First, we expect the sizable profit\ndrag from energy earnings to reverse in 2017,\nwith scope for a greater than $4–5 contribution\nto S&P 500 EPS if recently announced global oil\nproduction cuts are realized. Keep in mind that this\ncontribution was closer to $15 prior to the collapse\nin oil prices. Second, a shift to a 25% corporate tax\nrate could add $9–10 to S&P 500 EPS in 2017 if\nenacted retroactively (see Exhibit 52). Finally, a tax\nholiday for the estimated $1 trillion of cash held\noverseas could lead to an additional $1–2 of EPS\nupside from repatriation-driven buybacks.\nThere are also other, less visible potential\ncatalysts for equities. Over the last 20 years, the\ntotal return of stocks has exceeded that of 10-year\nTreasury bonds by only 2 percentage points, well\nbelow the historical average of 4.4 percentage\npoints and a result that ranks in the bottom 20%\nof all post-WWII observations. But after similar\nperiods of underperformance, stocks generated\nwell above average relative returns over the\nnext three and five years (see Exhibit 53). Said\ndifferently, history suggests stock returns will\noutpace those of bonds, even if expected equity\nreturns are uninspiring.\nA related source of upside stems from the\nlopsided investor flows evident in Exhibit 54. Here,\neven moderate rebalancing out of bonds by retail\ninvestors—who represent 80% of mutual fund\nowners—would represent a sizable tailwind to\nequities. Historically, a shift in flows from bonds\ninto equities has been motivated by three factors:\nconfidence in the durability of the economic\nrecovery, unattractive prospects for bond returns\nand higher equity prices (see Exhibit 55). Our\ncentral case features all three factors, suggesting the\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n53\nExhibit 55: US Equity Fund Flows and Change in\n10-Year Treasury Yield\nBond returns can influence flows into equity funds.\nPercentage Points, YoY\n4\n3\nChange in 10-Year Yield\nEquity Minus Bond Flows (Right)\n% of Assets, 3-Month Moving Average\n8\n6\nExhibit 56: The AAII Bullish Investor Sentiment\nLack of investor euphoria is a contrarian positive for stocks.\n% Bullish, 52-Week Average\n60\n55\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n1984 1989 1994 1999 2004 2009 2014\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-8\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 2013\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg, ICI.\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg, American Association of Individual Investors.\nExhibit 57: Non-Dealer US Equity Index Futures\nPositioning\nThere is scope for increased US equity positions.\n$ bn\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n-80\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, CFTC, Goldman Sachs Securities Division Equity\nStrats Group.\nincipient uptick in bond outflows seen in late 2016\nmay persist, especially with “risk-free” Treasuries\ndelivering a notable loss in the fourth quarter.\nToday’s visible lack of market euphoria\nrepresents another potential positive for stocks.\nExhibit 56 shows the proportion of investors\nclassifying themselves as “bullish” near its lowest\nlevel in decades. Meanwhile, non-dealer positions\nin US index futures stand well below the levels\nseen in 2013–14, providing scope for upside (see\nExhibit 57). If bull markets “die on euphoria” as\nSir John Templeton observed, then these measures\nargue we have not yet reached the apex.\nA rare technical analysis signal corroborates\nthat view. As shown in Exhibit 58, the Coppock\ncurve—an intermediate-length momentum signal—\nhas generated only 17 buy signals over the past 71\nyears, but collectively they have provided attractive\nlow-risk entry points for long-term investors. If\nwe took the median path of S&P 500 prices after\npast signals, it would imply the market gains 9%\nthis year with 88% odds of a positive outcome. Of\nparticular note, Coppock buy signals on the NYSE,\nRussell 2000 and FTSE All-World Index were also\ntriggered in November, even before the post-election\nrally. For all the reasons discussed above, we accord\na 25% probability to our good-case scenario of the\nS&P 500 reaching 2,450 by year-end.\nOf course, we are equally aware of the myriad\ndownside risks investors face, including growing\nunease about a disorderly backup in bond yields.\nBut here, our work suggests that rates have scope\nto increase further before becoming a headwind for\nstocks, even if adjusted for today’s lower long-run\nequilibrium nominal rate (see Exhibit 59). Keep\nin mind that 88% of S&P 500 debt has a fixed\ninterest rate and only about 10% matures each\nyear. The impact of higher rates will be spread over\nmany years as a consequence.\n54 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 58: Coppock Curve S&P 500 Buy Signals\nOne of only 17 post-WWII buy signals was triggered in\nJuly 2016.\nExhibit 59: Inflection Point for Negative\nCorrelation Between Bond Yields and Stock Prices\nTypically stocks and interest rates move in the same\ndirection until yields reach levels far above those seen today.\nS&P 500 Index (Log Scale)\n10,000\nUS 10-Year Treasury Yield (%)\n6\n5\n5.1\n1,000\n4\n3\n2\n2.4\n3.9\n100\n1\n0\nCurrent Historical Since 1962 Adjusted for Today’s\nLower Equilibrium Rate*\n10\n1945 1955 1965 1975 1985 1995 2005 2015\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\nYield at Which Stock Prices and\nBond Yields Become Negatively Correlated\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg, Federal Reserve.\n* Adjusts for the reduction of 1.25 percentage points in the long-run equilibrium nominal rate, in\nline with the shift in Federal Reserve projections since 2012.\nSome have taken a less sanguine view, arguing\nthat the “taper tantrum” of 2013 suggests bond\nyields have already reached a troublesome level for\nstocks. However, the tantrum primarily reflected\nconcerns that by tightening policy prematurely, the\nFederal Reserve was committing a mistake that\nwould undermine growth—a fact evident in the\nepisode’s widening credit spreads and declining\nbreakeven inflation rates. Despite a similarly\nrapid increase in rates this time around, we have\nseen the opposite market reaction, with credit\nspreads tightening and breakeven inflation rates\nmoving higher alongside growth expectations.\nThis contrast reminds us that the reason rates are\nincreasing is as important as their resulting level.\nAside from rates, ongoing concern about a\nhard landing in China and a banking or political\ncrisis in Europe remain top of mind (see Section\nI, The Risks to Our Outlook). We also start the\nyear with less of a buffer to absorb such adverse\ndevelopments, given today’s high valuations. Even\nworse, this narrower margin of safety arrives\nat a time when policy uncertainty in the US is\nparticularly acute, given upcoming changes to\ntax, trade and immigration policies under the new\nadministration. A destination tax, for example,\ncould be particularly damaging to S&P 500\nmargins given the growth of global supply chains\nin the last decade, not to mention the sizable\nExhibit 60: US Dollar Index\nEven if the dollar stays unchanged, it will still act as a drag\non US multinational earnings in early 2017.\nYoY %\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\nUS Dollar Index\nUS Dollar Index Assuming Constant from 12/31/16 Level\n-20\n2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\nData through December 31, 2016, with illustrative projection through 2017.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\nupward pressure it would place on the US dollar.\nEven at current levels, the dollar will represent a\nrenewed drag on US multinational earnings in the\nfirst quarter (see Exhibit 60).\nThat said, the collective impact of these various\nrisks is not yet sizable enough to undermine our\ncore view: we are in a longer-than-normal US\nrecovery that supports equity returns that are\n14\n26\n11\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n55\nExhibit 61: EAFE Price to 10-Year Average Cash\nFlow Discount to the US\nToday’s larger-than-average discount provides a margin of\nsafety to EAFE equities.\nExhibit 62: MSCI EMU Trailing 12-Month\nEarnings per Share\nProfits have been range-bound for almost four years.\nDiscount (%)\n60\n40\n20\nMSCI EAFE Discount to MSCI US\nAverage Since 1982\nAverage Since 1992\nTrailing 12-Month EPS (€)\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n0\n-20\n-40\n-19\n-33\n-40\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\nSideways\nSince 2012\n-60\n1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007 2012\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, MSCI, Datastream.\n0\n1969 1974 1979 1984 1989 1994 1999 2004 2009 2014\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\nlikely to exceed those of cash and bonds. In turn,\nwe recommend that clients maintain their strategic\nweight in US equities, although we acknowledge\nthat risks have risen at the same time that returns\nappear likely to be lower going forward. While US\nequities are not yet running on fumes, we should\nkeep a close eye on the fuel gauge.\nEAFE Equities: Priced for Imperfection\nThere is no shortage of concerns surrounding the\nvarious countries that comprise Europe, Australasia\nand the Far East (EAFE) equity markets. The\nlist is both long and valid, including persistently\nlow economic growth, a slow pace of structural\nreforms and incessant political uncertainty, as well\nas incremental, reactive and inconsistent policy\nresponses. Ongoing questions about the health of\nthe banking system only compound these worries.\nBut these concerns are also not new and are\nconsequently well understood by the market.\nIn turn, the key question facing investors is not\nwhether EAFE exposure subjects them to downside\nrisks. As the preceding list demonstrates, it clearly\ndoes. The question instead is whether investors are\nbeing fairly compensated to bear these risks.\nOne can never know precisely what equity\nmarkets are discounting, but the above concerns\nare almost certainly a key driver of EAFE\nunderperformance and the main reason behind\ntoday’s larger-than-normal valuation discount to\nUS equities (see Exhibit 61). While this margin\nof safety does not guarantee outperformance,\nit may provide investors with a larger buffer to\nabsorb adverse developments and miscalculations\nin their forecasts. In our view, the risk/return\nprofile of EAFE equities is more attractive than it\nfirst appears.\nAs a result, we do not recommend that\ninvestors underweight EAFE equities. In fact, there\nare reasons to believe that EAFE equities will\noutperform US equities in local currency terms\nthis year. In the sections that follow, we explore\nthese reasons by examining the three main EAFE\nmarkets, beginning with the Eurozone.\nEurozone Equities: The Onus Is\non Earnings\nEarnings have been going nowhere fast for\nEurozone equities. That’s apparent in Exhibit\n62, which shows that profits have been rangebound—at\nnearly half their 2007 peak level—for\nalmost four years. As a result, rising valuation\nmultiples have accounted for all of the 25% price\nappreciation over this period.\nThis seeming contradiction between stagnant\nearnings and rising multiples reflects the copious\nliquidity provided by the ECB’s quantitative\neasing. By depressing interest rates, ECB policy\n56 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 63: Relative Performance of ”Stable” and\n“Volatile” EAFE Stocks\nInvestors have recently shifted toward firms more exposed\nto the business cycle.\nExhibit 64: Spain 5-Year Credit Default Swap and\nRelative Equity Performance\nThe dramatic reduction in Spanish default risks suggests\nequity valuations have scope for upside.\nRelative Return (%)\n8\nStable\nVolatile\n6\nPrice Ratio (July 24, 2012 = 100)\n150\n140\nBasis Points\n0\n100\n4\n130\n200\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n120\n110\n100\n300\n400\n500\n600\n-6\nLast 3\nMonths\n2016-to-Date 5 Years 10 Years 1987–2007 Since 1987\nAnnualized Returns\n90\nMSCI Spain vs. MSCI EMU (Sector-Adjusted)\nSpanish CDS Spread (Right, Inverted)\n80\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n700\n800\nData as of October 31, 2016.\nNote: Equally weighted USD-hedged returns relative to the developed markets (ex-US).

But with ECB policy unlikely\nto become any more accommodative, additional\nvaluation expansion can no longer be taken for\ngranted. Instead, the onus for Eurozone equity\nupside now rests with earnings.\nHere, the prospects are favorable for several\nreasons. First, above-trend Eurozone GDP growth\nis likely to lead to boosted domestic sales and\nreduced economic slack, both of which have lifted\nEurozone earnings in the past. Second, the broader\npickup in global GDP growth we expect should\nbenefit the 45% of the EuroStoxx 50’s sales that\nare generated outside Europe. Higher revenue\nis particularly beneficial to these EuroStoxx\nfirms given their operating leverage, as small\nimprovements in sales spread over their sizable\nfixed costs also push profit margins higher. Finally,\nfinancial sector earnings stand to benefit from the\nhigher interest rates we foresee.\nAgainst this backdrop, we expect earnings\nto expand 5% in 2017. Meanwhile, valuation\nmultiples are likely to contract slightly as interest\nrates normalize higher and investor focus shifts\ntoward eventual ECB tapering late this year.\nCombining these elements with a 3.6% dividend\nyield implies EuroStoxx 50 total returns of\n3% in 2017.\nThe risks to our base case are skewed mildly\nto the upside. After underperforming most equity\nmarkets in 2016, Eurozone equities have room to\nplay catch-up. Moreover, the passing of long-feared\nFrench and German elections could compress\ntoday’s elevated equity risk premium, although\npolitical uncertainty is likely to remain high in the\ninterim. Finally, investors’ recent shift toward firms\nmore exposed to the business cycle should benefit\nEurozone firms given their greater operating\nleverage (see Exhibit 63).\nWithin the Eurozone, we are overweight\nSpanish equities. Here, we are drawn to attractive\nvaluations (see Exhibit 64), domestic growth\nmomentum and embedded overweight to banks.\nUK Equities: Scaling the Wall of Worry\nWhile the Brexit vote was surprising, the\nsubsequent performance of the UK stock market\nwas even more so. Despite the tremendous\npolitical and social uncertainty engendered by the\nreferendum’s outcome, UK equities generated one\nof the strongest returns of any major equity market\nlast year in local currency terms.\nSeveral factors at the root of this\noutperformance should continue to work in favor\nof UK equities in 2017. First, FTSE 100’s global\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n57\nExhibit 65: FTSE 100 Price Level and British Pound\nA weaker pound benefits FTSE 100 companies, which\ngenerate 75% of sales outside the UK.\nExhibit 66: TOPIX Price Level\nJapanese equities have traded in a large-butcontained\nrange.\nIndex Level\n7,300\n7,100\n6,900\n6,700\nFTSE 100 Price Level\nGBP/USD (Right, Inverted)\nBrexit\nVote\nExchange Rate\n1.15\n1.20\n1.25\n1.30\nPrice Level\n3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n6,500\n1.35\n2,000\nFlat\n6,300\n6,100\n5,900\nGBP\nDepreciation\n1.40\n1.45\n1.50\n1,500\n1,000\nFat\n5,700\n1.55\n500\n5,500\nJan-16 Mar-16 May-16 Jul-16 Sep-16 Nov-16\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\n1.60\n0\n1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Bloomberg.\nfootprint—75% of sales come from outside the\nUK economy—should benefit from the accelerating\nglobal GDP growth we expect this year, just\nas this exposure profited from last year’s 16%\ndepreciation of the British pound (see Exhibit\n65). Second, last year’s best-performing sectors—\ncommodities and financials—are well positioned\nto extend their run. Financials—the largest UK\nsector—stands to benefit from rising interest rates,\nwhile the commodity sectors should get a boost\nfrom higher oil prices. Notably, these two sectors\naccount for nearly half of FTSE 100 market\ncapitalization.\nWith these tailwinds in mind, we forecast UK\nearnings growth of 11% this year, the highest of\nour estimates across EAFE markets. That said,\ncontinued uncertainty around the implications\nof Brexit coupled with higher interest rates will\nlikely weigh on FTSE 100’s well-above-average\nvaluations. This view, combined with the UK equity\nmarket’s hefty dividend yield of 4.0%, results in a\n4% total return projection for the FTSE 100.\nAlthough this return is attractive on its face,\nWe project UK earnings growth of\n11% this year, the highest of our\nestimates across EAFE markets.\nwe do not believe it offers investors a large enough\nmargin of safety to justify a tactical overweight.\nKeep in mind that significant uncertainties remain\naround the final contours of Brexit. Moreover,\na shift by the Bank of England toward raising\ninterest rates this year could reverse much of the\nBritish pound’s depreciation, to the detriment of\nUK earnings. Finally, FTSE 100’s global footprint\ncould magnify any disruption to global trade\nvolumes resulting from protectionist policies.\nJapanese Equities: Scaling a Familiar Peak\nJapanese equities have experienced their fair share\nof booms and busts over the last 25 years. As seen\nin Exhibit 66, this pattern of offsetting swings has\nresulted in a “fat and flat” 108 trading range. With\nthe TOPIX price level again in the upper third of\nits historical band, it is natural to ask whether\n2017 will mark yet another market top in Japan.\nThe earnings outlook is pivotal to answering\nthis question. While our forecast for accelerating\nglobal GDP growth points toward higher\nearnings, near-peak profit margins are\na headwind (see Exhibit 67). Moreover,\nwith less central bank easing given the\nBOJ’s already sizable balance sheet, yen\ndepreciation—a key driver of Japanese\nrevenue growth since 2012—is expected\nto moderate this year. Even so, the\n58 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 67: Japanese Profit Margins\nNear-peak profit margins could be a headwind for\nJapanese equities.\nExhibit 68: Japanese Equity Valuations\nValuations are near the median level of Japan’s deflationary\nperiod since 1999.\nTrailing 12-Month Net Income (% of Sales)\n6\n5\nPercentile\n80\n70\n65\n69\n4\n3\n2\n60\n50\n40\n38\n43\nAverage: 52%\n47\n1\n30\n0\n20\n-1\n10\n-2\n1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\n0\nPrice to 10-Year\nAverage Earnings\nPrice-to-Peak\nEarnings\nPrice-to-Book\nValue\nPrice to 10-Year\nAverage Cash\nFlow\nPrice-to-Peak\nCash Flow\nData through November 30, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream.\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nNote: Based on data since 1999.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream, MSCI.\ninterplay of these inputs should still lead to positive\nearnings growth of 6% in 2017.\nThe direction of valuation multiples is equally\nimportant. As shown in Exhibit 68, Japanese\nvaluations are middling based on their history\nsince 1999, which we believe is the relevant\nevaluation period given the deflationary headwinds\nthat emerged thereafter. For equity multiples\nto move significantly higher from here would\nrequire sustainable above-trend earnings growth\nor a sizable increase in direct equity purchases\nby the Japanese central bank. But with the BOJ\nalready holding a remarkable 60% of Japanese\nETF market assets 109 and profit margins near\ntheir peak levels, neither of these upside catalysts\nseems probable. In fact, P/E multiples are forecast\nto contract in our base case, as the 6% earnings\ngrowth we expect will likely disappoint current\nmarket expectations of 12%.\nPutting these pieces together, we expect neither\na boom nor a bust for Japanese equities. Instead,\nthe combination of mid-single-digit earnings\ngrowth, slight compression in valuation multiples\nand a 1.9% dividend yield should generate a\n5% total return. While this return is attractive\nfrom an absolute standpoint, it also comes with\nsignificant downside risks given the country’s\npoor demographics, declining labor force and\nhigh government debt load. Consequently, we are\ntactically neutral on Japanese equities currently.\nEmerging Market Equities: Finally in Gear,\nbut Potholes Ahead\nEmerging market equities as a whole finally moved\nforward in 2016 after three years in reverse:\nmultiples expanded, earnings estimates improved\nand currencies appreciated, generating a 12%\ntotal return. Politics and commodity prices were\nkey performance differentiators among emerging\nmarkets last year, leading Brazil and Russia to the\nwinners’ podium while leaving Turkey and Mexico\nin last place.\nWe expect emerging market equities to remain\non track in 2017. Our central case calls for\nearnings growth of 5% in US dollar terms, driven\nby faster nominal GDP growth and the lagged\nimpact of easier financial conditions and higher\ncommodity prices. But with multiples already at\npost-crisis highs in an environment of rising global\nrates and heightened risks, we see little scope for\nfurther expansion. Combining these two inputs\nwith a dividend yield of 2.6%, our forecast implies\na total return of about 7% this year.\nHowever, the uncertainty around this forecast\nis quite large, as emerging market equities face\nseveral potential potholes on the road ahead.\nChief among these is the ultimate policy agenda\nof the incoming US administration. On the one\nhand, a policy mix that favors US growth over\ntrade restrictions would support emerging market\nexports and boost profits and equity returns.\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n59\nExhibit 69: EM Equity Valuations\nAggregate valuations are near neutral levels.\nNormalized Composite Z-Score\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2 -0.2 -0.2 -0.2\nRussia (4.5%)\nTaiwan (12.2%)\nChile (1.2%)\nKorea (14.4%)\nTurkey (1.0%)\nMalaysia (2.5%)\nThailand (2.3%)\n0.1\nEM\nOn the other hand, a harsher US stance on trade\nand foreign policy would hurt emerging market\nearnings, sentiment and valuation multiples.\nChina, Korea, Mexico and Taiwan—which\naccount for about 60% of MSCI emerging market\ncapitalization and earnings—seem particularly\nvulnerable in the latter scenario.

That said, we continue\nto explore relative investment opportunities that\nexploit the significant domestic activity, external\nvulnerability and valuation differences among\nindividual emerging countries.\n2017 Global Currency Outlook\nIn a notable departure from recent years, the\nUS dollar did not enjoy unequivocal dominance\nin 2016 (see Exhibit 70). The yen, for example,\nended a four-year slide against the greenback as\nthe market questioned the BOJ’s commitment\nto monetary easing. Certain emerging market\ncurrencies—such as the Russian ruble and Brazilian\nreal—also outperformed the dollar on the back of\nstronger commodity prices and favorable political\ndevelopments at home. And while the dollar did\nmake notable gains against the euro, pound and\nMexican peso in particular, these currencies enter\n2017 with a more balanced risk/reward profile\nas a result.\nThe upshot is that while tightening monetary\npolicy and potential fiscal expansion in the US\nwill continue to favor dollar strength, those\ngains are likely to be more modest and reflected\nin a narrower set of currencies as the dollar bull\nmarket enters its fifth year.

After all, dollar\nvaluation is now close to its historic average level\nrelative to the currencies of US trade partners, after\nadjusting for inflation. Moreover, the length of this\ndollar bull market is approaching that of the two\nprior episodes shown in Exhibit 71 and shares a\nsimilar underlying driver—tighter monetary policy\nin the US relative to its global peer group.\nBut while we expect the pace of US dollar\nappreciation to slow, there are many reasons\nto believe the greenback’s outperformance can\ncontinue this year. Dollar valuation remains\nbelow the peaks reached in the 1985 and 2002\nbull cycles, suggesting it is not yet prohibitively\nexpensive. The dollar should also benefit from\nsolid US macroeconomic fundamentals relative to\nother developed economies. President-elect Trump\nran on a platform that includes fiscal expansion\nand corporate tax reform. Although his economic\nteam’s spending plan is still forthcoming, the\npackage could represent an economic tailwind that\nmay justify tighter US monetary conditions at a\ntime when foreign central banks have committed\nto easier policy. In turn, relatively higher US yields\nmay entice global investors to favor US dollar\nassets over lower-yielding foreign-denominated\nalternatives.\nFurthermore, some elements of the new\nadministration’s desired corporate tax reform\ncould present material upside risk to the US dollar.\nFor example, the destination-based tax system\nsupported by several House Republicans disallows\ndeductions for any imported good or service—\nDollar gains are likely to be more\nmodest and reflected in a narrower\nset of currencies as the dollar bull\nmarket enters its fifth year.\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n6.3 Years 6.8 Years 5.4 Years\n-3\n1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 2013\nData through November 30, 2016.\nNote: Z-score is calculated on data since 1973 and represents the number of standard deviations\nfrom the mean.

Economic theory suggests that\nfree-floating currencies such as the US dollar\nwould need to adjust higher by the amount of\nthe tax to create equilibrium with similar goods\nsourced across foreign borders. Taken at face\nvalue, this implies a 20% destination tax would\nrequire a simultaneous—and potentially very\ndisruptive—20% increase in the US dollar. A tax\nholiday for cash held abroad could be similarly\ndollar positive, in spirit if not in magnitude. While\nit is true that a majority of the $2.6 trillion of US\ncorporate earnings trapped overseas are already\nheld in US dollar assets, the greenback would still\nenjoy a tailwind if corporates elected to repatriate\nsome portion of the foreign currency balance.\nThat said, the risks to the US dollar are not\nexclusively to the upside, as much of the good\nnews is embedded in current prices (see Exhibit\n72). Consider that the bulk of last year’s dollar\nadvance occurred in the two weeks following the\nUS presidential election in November, as\nthe market quickly discounted a portion\nof potential policy changes. Moreover,\nFederal Reserve rate hike expectations\nfor 2017 have increased following\nstronger US activity data during the\nsecond half of 2016. Lastly, we expect\nthe BOJ and ECB to maintain their\nhighly accommodative policies again\nthis year.

Last\nyear’s modest 3.2% decline actually masked a\nmuch larger 10% drop from the euro’s intra-year\npeak, half of which came in the weeks following\nthe US elections in November. Needless to say, the\ncombination of potentially expansionary fiscal\npolicy put in place by the new administration\ncoupled with tighter US monetary policy represents\na stiff headwind to the euro, particularly since\nWe should not lose sight of the fact\nthat after such persistent weakness\nversus the US dollar, the euro is\nundervalued and investors are now\npositioned for further weakness.\nthe ECB just extended quantitative easing until\nDecember 2017.\nWe expect these transatlantic policy divergences\nto persist, driving European investors to continue\nseeking higher-yielding, non-euro-denominated\nassets abroad (see Exhibit 73). This preference\nwill likely be bolstered by uncertainty surrounding\nupcoming national elections in Germany, France,\nthe Netherlands and possibly Italy and Spain.\nWhile our central case assumes mainstream parties\nprevail, any result that raises questions about the\nlong-term viability of the European Monetary\nUnion could push the euro even lower.\nStill, we should not lose sight of the fact that\nafter such persistent weakness versus the US dollar,\nthe euro is undervalued and investors are now\npositioned for further weakness. Additionally, the\nabove-trend Eurozone growth and normalizing\ninflation we expect could justify the ECB shifting\ntoward a more neutral stance later this year.\nSuch a move would narrow the interest\nrate differential between the US and\nEurozone, weakening a linchpin of the\nweaker euro thesis.\nGiven this balance of risks, we\nremoved our tactical short positions in\nthe euro relative to the dollar following\nthe November US presidential election,\nreturning to a neutral view.\n62 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 74: Japanese Net Purchases of Foreign\nLong-Term Debt by Investor Type\nAdditional buying of foreign assets by Japanese investors\ncould put further downward pressure on the yen.\n12-Month Rolling Sum, % of GDP\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\nBanks\nPension Trusts\nInsurers\nAll Other*\nCapital Into Japan\n= Yen Appreciation\nCapital Out of Japan\n= Yen Depreciation\n2013 2014 2015 2016\nData through November 30, 2016.\nNote: Q3 2016 data used to calculate Q4 2016 share of GDP.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Haver Analytics.\n* All Other defined as central banks, general government, financial instruments firms, investment\ntrust management companies and others.\nYen\nFor yen investors, last year was a reminder that\nmarkets often take an escalator up but an elevator\ndown. After steadily appreciating almost 20%\nagainst the US dollar over the first nine months\nof 2016, the currency forfeited those gains in\njust weeks after the surprising US presidential\nelection. Although the net effect was a small 2.8%\nappreciation last year—breaking a four-year streak\nof yen weakness—we do not believe further yen\nstrength is likely.\nThere are two reasons for this view. First, the\nBOJ will likely keep rates negative or close to zero\nthis year by maintaining highly accommodative\nmonetary policy. In turn, Japanese investors will\ncontinue to sell low-yielding domestic assets—\nplacing downward pressure on the yen—in order\nto fund purchases of higher-yielding offshore assets\n(see Exhibit 74). Japan’s Government Pension\nInvestment Fund (GPIF)—which manages the\nworld’s largest public pension—is a case in point,\nas it will need to sell domestic fixed income assets\nto reach its stated targets for foreign investments.\nSimilarly, Japanese life insurers may increase\ntheir exposure to foreign currencies if interest\nrate differentials between the US and Japan\nremain wide.\nSecond, Japanese corporations are likely\nto sell yen to invest in foreign operations with\nbetter growth prospects, which will also place\ndownward pressure on the Japanese currency; such\nannouncements are already on the rise. 110\nThis is not to suggest that the prospects for the\nyen are completely one-sided. The higher global\nrates we expect may make it difficult for the BOJ\nto maintain such low domestic yields, which would\nalleviate some of the downward pressure on the\ncurrency. Moreover, the many sources of global\nuncertainty in the year ahead could lead investors\nback into the yen as a liquid hedge, as we saw in\nthe first half of 2016. Finally, after four years of\nweakness, the yen has reached undervalued levels.\nGiven this more balanced risk profile, we\ncurrently have no tactical position in the yen.\nBritish Pound\nWhile broader financial markets were unperturbed\nby the UK’s decision to leave the European Union,\nthe same cannot be said for currencies. Here,\nthe Brexit vote sent the pound tumbling to its\nlowest level versus the US dollar since the 1985\nPlaza Accord. 111 Although the pound has since\nrecovered some of those losses, its 16.3% decline\nrelative to the US dollar last year still ranks as the\nworst performance among all developed market\ncurrencies.\nThe trajectory of the pound will be largely\nshaped by the evolution of Brexit negotiations.\nEven though six months have passed since the\nvote, there is no greater clarity on how the UK\nwill ultimately exit the European Union and on\nwhat terms. Clearly a combative stance could see\nthe pound weaken further as the market discounts\nlower potential growth in the UK. Alternatively, a\nmore conciliatory negotiating position could lead\nto upside from today’s depressed levels.\nBarring a hostile negotiating tack from the\nUK government, the pound also has several other\nfactors working in its favor. First, foreigners\ncontinue to buy pounds to invest in UK-domiciled\nassets and firms, which is vital to funding the UK’s\nsizable 5.2% of GDP current account deficit. In\nfact, one of the largest cross-border acquisitions\nlast year was announced less than one month\nfollowing the EU referendum. 112 Importantly,\nhigher-frequency data shows this merger and\nacquisition (M&A) momentum is continuing (see\nExhibit 75).\nSecond, the Bank of England may need to raise\ninterest rates sooner than markets now expect, as\nerstwhile sterling depreciation is quickly feeding\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n63\nExhibit 75: UK Cash Merger and Acquisition\nAnnouncement Pipeline\nContinued inbound M&A activity could benefit the pound.\n6-Month Rolling Sum, $ bn\n150\n100\n50\n0\n-50\n-100\n-150\nInbound M&A\nOutbound M&A\nNet M&A\nCapital Into the UK\n= Pound Appreciation\nCapital Out of the UK\n= Pound Depreciation\nMay-16 Jun-16 Jul-16 Aug-16 Sep-16 Oct-16 Nov-16 Dec-16\nData through December 31, 2016.\nNote: October 2016 outbound M&A adjusted to exclude stock portion of British American\nTobacco’s takeover of Reynolds.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\nthrough to higher domestic inflation. In turn,\nhigher UK interest rates would make sterlingdenominated\nassets more appealing to foreign\ninvestors and support the currency.\nFinally, while sterling certainly has scope to\ndepreciate, market participants are already wellpositioned\nfor further weakness. Those positions\nmay become vulnerable if the UK’s negotiations\nwith its trade partners turn more amicable and the\ndomestic UK economy remains resilient.\nWith these upside risks being tempered by the\nunknowable evolution of Brexit negotiations for\nnow, we see balanced risks for the pound this year\nand thus remain tactically neutral.\nEmerging Market Currencies\nEmerging market currencies caught a welcome\nupdraft last year, following a 45% freefall since\nmid-2011. The flight was not without turbulence,\nhowever. Following a 12% rally in the first half of\nthe year—reflecting a dovish shift in US monetary\npolicy and waning fears about Chinese capital\noutflows—emerging market currencies hit an air\npocket that erased much of these gains following\nthe surprise outcome of the US elections.\nWe believe this downdraft is likely to persist.\nThe prospect of higher US interest rates, a stronger\ndollar and China’s bumpy deceleration spells\ntighter global financial conditions and a risk\nof capital outflows from emerging markets—\nconditions that have historically constituted a stiff\nheadwind to their currencies.\nThese risks are magnified by the uncertainty\nsurrounding the incoming US administration’s\ntrade policies. Fears of protectionism have already\nnegatively impacted the currencies of China and\nMexico—the two largest sources of manufacturing\nexports to the US—with the peso and Chinese\nrenminbi down 11.6% and 2.3%, respectively,\nsince the election.\nEven so, we do not think a broad tactical short\nin emerging market currencies is appealing at this\nstage. Despite the small rally last year, emerging\nmarket currencies remain attractively valued (see\nExhibit 76), particularly given their enticing 5%\nyield differential to the US dollar. Moreover, the\nnew US administration may prove to be more\nmeasured in its actions than its rhetoric—a nonnegligible\nrisk that could revive sentiment and\nimprove prospects for emerging market currencies.\nThe Mexican peso, in particular, could benefit in\nthat event.\nFor now, we remain tactically positioned to\nbenefit from further renminbi weakness given our\nlong-standing concerns about China’s economic\nvulnerabilities and the likelihood of looser policy,\npolicy mistakes and capital outflows. The potential\nfor US trade protectionism directed at China,\nthough not our base case, would further benefit\nthis position.\n2017 Global Fixed Income Outlook\nLast year witnessed a notable reversal of fortune\nfor global interest rates. Despite reaching all-time\nclosing lows shortly after the surprise Brexit vote,\n10-year yields in developed markets had reclaimed\nmuch—if not all—of those declines by year-end.\nIn the US, a more than one percentage point swing\nwas sufficient to turn the 10-year bond’s 9% gain\ninto a loss.\nWhile some have portrayed this reversal as\njust another setback in the now three-decade-old\nbond bull market, we are more skeptical. The\npolicy mix that has depressed interest rates in\nthe post-crisis period—a combination of fiscal\nausterity, negative or near-zero central bank policy\nrates and large-scale asset purchases—is losing\nfavor, as even policymakers acknowledge the often\ncounterproductive impact of these policies.

Losses from\nthese long-duration positions in response to higher\nrates could beget more bond sales, creating a\nvicious cycle. That yields are still extremely low\nby historical standards does little to assuage these\nfears. Consider that 10-year government bond\nyields in all G-7 countries have been higher at least\n90% of the time since 1958. Given all the above,\nFor now, we remain tactically\npositioned to benefit from further\nrenminbi weakness given our longstanding\nconcerns about China’s\neconomic vulnerabilities and the\nlikelihood of looser policy, policy\nmistakes and capital outflows.\nwe believe the ascent of interest rates remains in\nits infancy.\nStill, it is important to differentiate between\na normalization of interest rates and a disorderly\nbackup. While we expect higher interest rates over\nthe coming years, secular headwinds—like aging\ndemographics and slower productivity growth—\nsuggest the terminal point of that increase will be\nlower than the historical average. This fact is not\nlost on the Federal Reserve, which has reduced\nits estimate of the long-run equilibrium nominal\nrate—the rate consistent with full employment and\nstable inflation in the medium term—from 4.25%\nto 3% over recent years.\nWith a lower interest rate target\nto reach, the Federal Reserve is likely\nto proceed slowly, particularly given\nuncertainty around its estimate of the\neconomy’s equilibrium rate and lingering\ninternational risks. Even if the Federal\nReserve were to raise rates three times in\n2017, that pace would still be less than\nhalf of the historical median tightening\npace. 113 Thus far in this cycle, the\nFederal Reserve has raised rates only\nonce per year.\nAgainst this backdrop, we recommend\ninvestors favor credit over duration risk\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n65\nby remaining overweight US corporate high yield\ncredit versus investment grade fixed income and by\nfunding various tactical tilts from their high-quality\nbond allocation. While most investment grade\nbonds may have uninspiring tactical prospects, we\nemphasize that investors should not completely\nabandon their bond allocation in search of higher\nyields. As the last several years have reminded\nus, investment grade fixed income serves a vital\nstrategic role in the portfolio, due to its ability to\nhedge against deflation, reduce portfolio volatility\nand generate income.\nIn the sections that follow, we review the\nspecifics of each fixed income market.\nUS Treasuries\nWhile 2016 began as a bumper year for US\nTreasuries, it ended in a rout. The yield on 10-year\nTreasury bonds, for example, reached an all-time\nlow of just 1.36% by the middle of last year before\njolting higher by more than one percentage point\nby year-end. As a result, investors’ nearly doubledigit\ngains devolved into a small loss. Even worse,\nthe bulk of the rate increase occurred in just the\nlast three months of 2016, generating a 7% loss for\nthe quarter that has been exceeded less than 1% of\nthe time historically since 1981.\nWe expect rates to continue to increase, albeit\nat a slower pace in 2017, as many of the forces\nthat have restrained yields are slowly fading.\nInflation, in particular, has been a persistent drag,\nreflecting a toxic combination of excess labor slack\nthat depressed wages, a strong dollar that lowered\nimport prices and a significant decline in oil prices\nthat weighed on breakeven inflation rates. But\nas we begin the eighth year of the US expansion,\nlabor slack has been largely absorbed, evident in\ntoday’s firming wages. Moreover, the impact of the\ndollar is diminishing as its pace of ascent slows,\nwhile the recovery in oil is boosting breakeven\ninflation rates.\nOther headwinds are also receding. The fiscal\nausterity among the advanced economies that\nhas dampened economic growth and decreased\nsovereign bond issuance—both of which depress\ninterest rates—is now reversing (see Exhibit 78).\nIndeed, US fiscal spending is expected to add\n0.3–0.5 percentage points to GDP growth in each\nof the next two years. 114\nAt the same time, there is reduced demand\nfor risk-free assets, like US Treasuries, given\nthe unexpectedly sanguine reaction to negative\nExhibit 78: Fiscal Stance of Advanced Economies\nFiscal austerity in developed markets has reversed in\nrecent years.\nNumber of Countries\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n5 6\n6\n6\n23 22 22\n8\n4\n10 9\n9 12\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, IMF.\nTightened Remained Neutral Loosened\ngeopolitical events—such as the UK and Italian\nreferenda—and the results of the US election.\nFinally, the deleterious impact of depressed interest\nrates on banking sector profitability has raised the\nhurdle for global central banks to cut interest rates\nfurther and/or increase the scale of QE programs. In\nturn, market focus has shifted toward the eventual\ntapering of BOJ, ECB and BOE accommodation,\nwhich has helped lift bond term premiums and\nboosted long-term yields (see Exhibit 79).\nIn light of these waning headwinds, the Federal\nReserve is likely to hike two or three times in 2017,\nwith upside risks from a larger-than-anticipated\nfiscal expansion. Combined with some further\nnormalization in the term premium, we expect 10-\nyear rates to increase to 2.50–3.00% by year-end.\nGiven the balance of risks, we remain comfortable\nfunding tactical tilts out of investment grade\nfixed income.\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)\nTIPS fared better than nominal bonds in 2016,\ndelivering a positive mid-single-digit return. Their\noutperformance was driven by the recovery in\nbreakeven inflation rates, which began the year at\nvery depressed levels consistent with only 1.5%\nannual inflation over the next 10 years—well\nbelow long-run forecasts (see Exhibit 80). In fact,\nour work suggests that breakeven inflation rates\nwere reflecting high odds of a deep recession over\nthe course of 2016, well above the risk suggested\nby our recession models.\n15\n13\n16\n9\n9\n66 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 79: US 10-Year Yields and Term Premium\nExpected tapering from major central banks has contributed\nto higher long-term yields and bond term premiums.\nExhibit 80: US 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate\nand Consensus Inflation Rate Forecasts\nTIPS benefited from a recovery in breakeven inflation\nrates in 2016.\n%\n4\n3\n10-Year Treasury Yield\nRisk-Neutral Yield\nTerm Premium\n% Annualized\n3.0\n2.5\n10-Year Breakeven Inflation\n10-Year Ahead Inflation Forecast\n2.0\n2\n1.5\n1\n1.0\n0\n0.5\n-1\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\n0.0\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\nWe think that breakeven inflation rates have\nfurther room to rise as the concerns that depressed\nthem last year fade. First, oil prices are recovering,\nreversing the persistent drag they had exerted\nthroughout much of early 2016. Second, wages are\nfirming and fiscal policy is being eased, dampening\ndeflation worries. Finally, recession odds are\nfalling as the drag from oil weakness and dollar\nstrength fades.\nWith breakeven inflation rates still below longterm\nconsensus forecasts and the Federal Reserve’s\ntarget, we expect positive total returns from TIPS\nin 2017. Still, TIPS’ absolute returns are likely to\nbe modest, as their eight-year duration will make it\ndifficult for coupon income to meaningfully exceed\nprincipal losses as rates rise. Moreover, given TIPS’\nunfavorable tax treatment (discussed at length\nin our 2011 Outlook), we continue to advise US\nclients with taxable accounts to use municipal\nbonds for their strategic allocation.\nWe expect rates to continue to\nincrease, albeit at a slower pace in\n2017, as many of the forces that have\nrestrained yields are slowly fading.\nUS Municipal Bond Market\nMunicipal bond holders were not immune from\n2016’s about-face in US Treasury yields. Last\nOctober, municipal bonds were enjoying some of\ntheir best returns in years, only to be hit by losses\narising from both rising interest rates and budding\nconcerns about tax changes in the wake of the US\npresidential election. The abrupt redemptions of\nmunicipal bond mutual funds only exacerbated\nthese losses, with the pace of outflows second only\nto the mid-2013 taper tantrum (see Exhibit 81).\nAll told, municipal bonds suffered one of their\nworst years in recent history, with intermediate\nmunicipal bonds actually experiencing a rare loss\n(see Exhibit 82).\nUnfortunately, the near-term outlook remains\nchallenging. As Exhibit 81 reminds us, mutual\nfund flows tend to be sticky in this asset class,\nwith persistent periods of both buying and selling\ndepending on the trajectory of interest rates. Based\non historical episodes, there is scope for the current\nstring of outflows to extend further.\nMoreover, clarity on tax policy will\nremain elusive for months, during which\ntime headline risk will be significant.\nEven worse, a sizable reduction in the\ntop individual tax rate for municipal\nbonds—if ultimately passed—could\nsignificantly shift the economics of\nowning them, leading to further sales.\nThese fresh worries on tax policies\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n67\nExhibit 81: Municipal Bond Mutual Fund Flows\nThe pace of outflows at the end of 2016 was surpassed in\nrecent history only by the 2013 taper tantrum.\n4-Week Rolling Average, $ bn\n3\nExhibit 82: Annual Municipal Bond Returns\nSince 1994\nIntermediate municipal bonds experienced a rare\nloss in 2016.\nRanked Annual Returns (%)\n15\n2\n1\n10\n0\n-1\n5\n-2\n-3\n0\n-4\n-5\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n-5\n1995\n2002\n2000\n2011\n1997\n2009\n1998\n2001\n2007\n2014\n1996\n2003\n2008\n2006\n2012\n2010\n2004\n2015\n2005\n1999\n2016\n2013\n1994\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, ICI.\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Barclays.\nonly add to existing concerns about pension\nfunding levels.\nWhile there is clearly no shortage of risks, the\nsilver lining to last year’s rout is that we begin\n2017 with a much larger valuation buffer to help\nabsorb them. As seen in Exhibit 83, the ratio\nof municipal yields to Treasury yields is above\naverage for both 5- and 10-year maturities. In\nturn, investors can currently earn an extra 70\nbasis points of after-tax yield by owning fiveyear\nmunicipal bonds instead of same-maturity\nTreasuries—a yield pickup more than double the\npost-crisis median of 31 basis points. Moreover,\nthis incremental after-tax yield would still be\naround 50 basis points if the top individual tax on\ninvestment income were reduced by 10 percentage\npoints—from 43.4% with the Affordable\nCare Act (ACA) tax to 33% under new policy\nrecommendations. In short, municipal spreads\ncurrently offer a potential offset to rising rates and\npotential tax changes.\nAlso keep in mind that municipal fundamentals\nremain stable. Major state and local tax revenues\nhave continued to increase at a moderate 3% pace,\nwhich should be supported by the above-trend\nUS economic growth and rising home prices we\nforecast. Meanwhile, governments have exercised\nrestraint on capital spending. Consider that net\nissuance expectations of $30 billion for 2017 stand\nwell below the pre-crisis 10-year annual average\nof $110 billion. 115 This restraint has not only kept\nnet supply low—as new issuance has been largely\noffset by maturing debt—but has also helped\nmunicipal finances. Ratings trends have improved\nas a result of both stable revenue and spending\ndiscipline, with upgrades in the Moody’s universe\nseeing a notable uptick in last year’s third quarter\n(see Exhibit 84).\nOf course, underfunded long-term pension\nliabilities remain a source of concern. But with\naggregate funding levels holding steady at around\n74%, we do not think this will be a primary focus\nin 2017, particularly given last year’s increase in\nstock prices. While rising equity values will do\nlittle to remedy municipals’ inadequate funding\ncontributions, they will help increase the value\nof pension assets. Moreover, these medium-term\nconcerns are not the primary driver of recent\nmunicipal bond weakness. After all, today’s\nfunding levels are no worse than they were in\nOctober of last year, a time when municipal bonds\nwere enjoying some of their best returns ever.\nAll told, we expect intermediate municipal\nstrategies to gain about 1% in 2017. With\nthis return close to that of cash but with more\ndownside potential, we still think it makes sense\nfor clients to fund various tactical tilts from their\nhigh-quality municipal bond allocation. This\nrecommendation is motivated primarily by rate\nrisk and not credit concerns, since we expect\nmunicipal defaults to be rare events.

Given their important\nportfolio hedging characteristics, municipal bonds\nshould remain the bedrock of the “sleep-well”\nportion of a US-based client’s portfolio.\nThe same can be said for high yield municipal\nbonds. Despite their almost 10-year duration, these\nbonds currently offer attractive spreads of close to\n3%, a level that has been higher only 29% of the\ntime since 2000. This spread provides a substantial\nbuffer that could partially offset higher Treasury\nyields, enabling the high yield municipal market\nto deliver positive returns of around 4% in our\nbase case. Therefore, we recommend clients stay\ninvested at their customized strategic weight.\nUS Corporate High Yield Credit\nEven for the bullish among us, last year’s\n17% total return in corporate high yield was\nsurprisingly strong.

What makes this performance even more\nimpressive is that high yield was down about 5%\nat its worst point in early 2016.\nBut these sizable gains have come at a cost.\nSpreads—which compensate investors for the risk\nof default losses—now stand well below their longterm\naverage. In fact, the level of spreads has been\nlower only a third of the time in the last 30 years.\nMoreover, yields have fallen from above 10%\nearly last year to less than 7% now, diminishing\nthe allure of these bonds to investors searching for\nhigh returns.\nEven so, we think the strong fundamentals\nunderpinning the asset class still warrant an\noverweight, though returns are almost certain to\nbe more modest going forward. At the heart of\nthis stance is our benign view on default losses,\nwhich are the primary risk to high yield investors.\nHere, several factors support our below-historicalaverage\n2.5% par-weighted default\nforecast for 2017.\nFirst, high yield firms stand to benefit\ndirectly from the strengthening US\neconomy we expect this year, considering\nalmost three-quarters of their sales\noriginate domestically. 116 Second, leading\nindicators of defaults—such as Moody’s\nliquidity and covenant stress indexes—\nare trending downward, suggesting\nfewer speculative-grade companies are\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n69\nExhibit 85: Moody’s Liquidity Stress Index and\nDefault Rates\nLeading indicators suggest the path of defaults for high\nyield is lower.\nExhibit 86: Cumulative US High Yield Debt\nMaturity by Year\nLess than 10% of existing debt matures in the next\ntwo years.\nIndex (%) Trailing 12-Month Rate (%)\n25\nComposite Liquidity Stress Index\n16\nSpeculative-Grade Issuer-Weighted Default Rate (Right)\n14\nCumulative Maturity (%)\n100\nHigh Yield Bonds\n90\nBank Loans\n86\n100 100\n20\n15\n12\n10\n80\n70\n60\n67\n63\n8\n10\n6\n4\n5\n2\n0\n0\n2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n47\n42\n33\n20 19\n10\n7\n4\n1\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 or later\nData through November 30, 2016.\nNote: Moody’s Liquidity Stress Indexes fall when corporate liquidity appears to improve and rise\nwhen it appears to weaken.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Moody’s.\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, JP Morgan.\nexperiencing liquidity problems or are at risk of\nbreaching financial covenants. As seen in Exhibit\n85, Moody’s composite Liquidity Stress Index\n(LSI) began to deteriorate in advance of previous\ndefault cycles. Third, the commodity sectors of the\nhigh yield universe—which collectively generated\na staggering 85% of last year’s defaults—are\nrecovering along with oil prices. Keep in mind\nthat the par-weighted default rate excluding\nthese sectors was just 0.5% last year, a fraction\nof the 3.2% long-run average. 117 Finally, our\ndefault model—which incorporates the leading\ncharacteristics of the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan\nOfficer Opinion Survey and the percentage of\ndistressed bonds—is projecting 2–3% par-weighted\ndefaults in the year ahead.\nOther factors corroborate our low-default view.\nAs seen in Exhibit 86, there is very little refinancing\nWe think the strong fundamentals\nunderpinning US corporate high yield\nstill warrant an overweight, though\nreturns are almost certain to be more\nmodest going forward.\nrisk, given that less than 10% of existing debt\nmatures in the next two years. Of equal importance,\ninterest coverage stands near all-time highs today,\nin stark contrast to the period preceding the\nfinancial crisis (see Exhibit 87). This point is further\nillustrated by Exhibit 88, which shows that today’s\nhigh yield universe is much healthier than the precrisis\ncohort, regardless of measure. Keep in mind\nthat low-rated CCC bonds represented just 8% of\nhigh yield issuance last year, a 14-year low. 118\nWe also note that high yield may be a better\ninterest rate hedge than many investors realize.\nConsider that during unexpected interest rate\nbackups in the past, high yield has generated a\npositive return 69% of the time and a return that\nexceeded investment grade fixed income 85%\nof the time (see Exhibit 89). This last point is\nimportant, as our high yield overweight is funded\nout of investment grade fixed income.\nHigh yield’s hedging qualities were\napparent last year, as the asset class\nappreciated nearly 7% in the second\nhalf of the year despite an increase in\nTreasury yields of more than 100 basis\npoints. Although we assume that any\nfurther increase in 10-year Treasury\nrates this year will not be offset by high\nyield spreads, this historical relationship\nsuggests that may be overly conservative.\n70 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 87: High Yield Par-Weighted Interest\nCoverage Ratio\nInterest coverage today stands near all-time highs,\nunlike the pre-crisis period.\nExhibit 88: Characteristics of US High\nYield Issuance\nToday’s high yield universe is much healthier than the\npre-crisis cohort.\nCoverage Ratio\nUse of New Issuance Proceeds (%)\n5\n4.5\n4.6\n4.4\n60\n2006–07 Average 2015–16 Average\n4\n50\n48\n40\n3\n30\n27\n29\n2\n20\n1\n10\n12\n10\n0\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n1Q16\n2Q16\n3Q16\n0\nLBO and M&A Low-Rated Companies Aggressive Securities\n(PIK/Toggle Bonds)\n0\nData through Q3 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Barclays.\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, JP Morgan.\nOf course, a more constructive view of high\nyield fundamentals does not necessarily suggest\nrobust returns. In high yield bonds, today’s belowaverage\nspreads already reflect our subdued default\nexpectations and are less likely to offset any further\nincrease in rates. We thus expect returns of around\n4% in the year ahead. Although high yield energy\nis likely to generate similar gains, the potential\nupside is more significant given wider starting\nspreads and the potential for distressed bonds to\npull to par amid higher oil prices. Finally, with a\n5% return, bank loans should perform marginally\nbetter than bonds, reflecting their attractive\n0.25-year duration and continued investor demand\nfor floating rates—a feature that is back in vogue\nnow that 3-month LIBOR is almost above the\n1% LIBOR floor that more than 90% of bank\nloans possess.\nWhile these returns may pale in comparison to\nthose of last year, they remain attractive relative to\ninvestment grade fixed income, where we expect\nrising rates to generate lower returns. Even if rates\nstagnate while US growth remains positive, the\ndefault-adjusted return in high yield should still\ntrump high-quality bonds. Said differently, US\ncorporate high yield credit remains a better house\nin a bad fixed income neighborhood, supporting\nour modest overweight recommendation.\nExhibit 89: High Yield Credit Performance During\nPeriods of Rising Rates\nHigh yield has historically outperformed investment grade\nbonds during episodes of rising rates.\nAverage Return (%)\n5\nAverage Total Return During\nEpisodes of Rising Rates*\n4\n% of Time Positive (Right)\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\nInv.

This served as a poignant\nreminder of how divergent monetary policies\ncan shape returns. Three ECB actions in March\ndrove this robust relative performance. First,\nthe ECB reversed its prior commitment to avoid\n75\n50\n25\n0\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n71\nfurther rate cuts and lowered the deposit rate to\n-0.40%. Second, it increased the size of its asset\npurchase program from €60 billion to €80 billion\nper month, effectively buying more Eurozone\nbonds each year than are actually issued (see\nExhibit 90). Finally, it continued to limit its buying\nto bonds with yields above the deposit rate,\nwhich concentrated its purchases toward longmaturity\nbonds.\nThese measures created an extreme scarcity\neffect in long-term German bunds, as investors\nscrambled to buy today for fear of even lower\ninterest rates tomorrow. In response, German\n10-year rates fell to an all-time low of -18 basis\npoints in July of 2016. During these same summer\nmonths, all German government bonds with less\nthan a 15-year maturity offered negative yields.\nHowever, monetary policy does not operate in\na vacuum. With negative interest rates impairing\nthe profitability of the European banking system,\nthe ECB has already begun to alter its policy mix.\nAt its December 2016 meeting, the ECB reversed\nthe increase in asset purchases mentioned above,\ntargeting €60 billion per month for the upcoming\nMarch–December 2017 period. Moreover, it lifted\nthe restriction on purchasing bonds with yields\nbelow the deposit rate, alleviating the scarcity\npremium attached to long-maturity bonds meeting\nthis criterion. While these adjustments are well\nshort of QE “tapering,” they have shifted the\nmarket focus toward the eventual end of asset\npurchases and the timing of the first ECB rate\nhike—currently priced for late 2018.\nWith less ECB policy pressure on long-maturity\nbonds, coupled with continued above-trend\nEurozone growth and some further normalization\nin global term premiums, we expect 10-year bund\nyields to increase to 0.5–1.0% by the end of 2017.\nWhile overall peripheral bond spreads should be\nmostly range-bound in 2017, political woes in\nItaly and France pose upside risks to the spreads of\nthose countries.\nIn the UK, we expect gilt yields to reach 1.5–\n2.25%. Here, persistently high headline inflation\ninduced by the depreciation of sterling and a\nless-than-feared economic drag from Brexit thus\nfar could encourage the BOE to unwind a portion\nof the preemptive easing it deployed in response to\nthe surprise referendum outcome.\nGiven this outlook and today’s still depressed\nbond yields, we remain underweight UK and\nEurozone government bonds for European\nExhibit 90: European Government Bond Issuance\nand ECB Purchases\nECB buying is outpacing net issuance of Eurozone bonds.\n€ bn\n400\n200\n0\n-200\n-400\n-600\n-800\nNet Issuance ECB Purchases Net Issuance Including ECB Purchases\n240 211\n-626\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, JP Morgan.\ninvestors. After all, just a 2 basis point increase in\nGerman 10-year bund yields generates a capital\nloss sufficient to offset an entire year of income.\nThat said, we should not confuse an underweight\nwith a zero weighting, as European clients should\nretain some exposure to German bunds and other\nhigh-quality Eurozone bonds in the “sleep-well”\nportion of their portfolios. These high-quality\nbonds would provide an attractive hedge in the\nevent of a Eurozone recession or the return of\ndeflationary concerns.\nEmerging Market Local Debt\nLast year’s 10% return for emerging market local\ndebt (EMLD) provided some solace to those who\nhave suffered through nearly three years of losses\ntotaling more than 30%. But investors had to\nendure considerable volatility to realize this gain,\nas returns fluctuated between -4% and +18% in\n2016. In fact, the asset class lost roughly 5% in just\nthe last two months of the year.\nThis last point is important, since many of the\ntailwinds that drove EMLD’s strong returns in the\nfirst half of 2016 reversed toward year-end and are\nlikely to impact the asset class again in 2017. Here,\nwe refer specifically to the resumption of Federal\nReserve rate hikes, renewed US dollar appreciation\nand a resumption of Chinese renminbi depreciation\nagainst the dollar. Just as falling global interest\nrates helped the asset class for the first part of\n2016, so too should the rising rates we expect\n-386\n-511\n2016 2017\n-300\n72 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 91: EM Local Debt Currencies and\nDeveloped Market Interest Rates\nRising global interest rates would be a headwind to EM\nlocal debt.\nExhibit 92: S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Total\nReturn Index\nCommodities generated their first double-digit return\nsince 2009.\n%\n1.2\n1.0\nAverage G3 10-Year Rate\nEM Local Debt FX (Right, Inverted)\n1/1/2016 = 100\n94\n96\nAnnual Returns (%)\n60\n40\n98\n0.8\n100\n20\n2016 Return: 11%\n0.6\n102\n0\n0.4\n104\n-20\n106\n0.2\n108\n-40\n0.0\nJan-16 Apr-16 Jul-16 Oct-16\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg, Datastream.\n110\n-60\n1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012 2016\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\nrepresent a headwind this year (see Exhibit\n91). Meanwhile, any boost to emerging market\nexports from the modest pickup in global growth\nwe expect is likely to be dwarfed by ongoing US\ntrade policy uncertainty, European political risk\nand China fears. Lastly, an acceleration of recent\noutflows from EMLD markets could magnify these\nrisks, particularly since 60% of the cumulative\ninflows into the asset class since 2004 are\nexperiencing losses at current market levels.\nAlthough the number of concerns is large, so is\nthe risk premium of the asset class. As previously\nseen in Exhibit 76, the currencies in the EMLD\nindex are 15% undervalued. From this starting\npoint, the asset class could deliver attractive total\nreturns if US trade policy proves to be more benign\nthan feared and China worries abate.\nConsidering this balance of risks, our central\ncase calls for low single-digit returns. While\npositive, this return is not sufficient to justify\na tactical long position in EMLD in our view,\ngiven the still considerable downside risks\ndiscussed above.\nEmerging Market Dollar Debt\nEmerging market dollar debt (EMD) returned 10%\nin 2016, capping a surprising four-year period\nof outperformance that has greatly benefited\nfrom stable US rates and dollar strength. But the\nprospects for a fifth year of upside are questionable\nfor several reasons.\nFirst, EMD’s almost seven-year duration is\na liability in a rising-rate environment. This is\nparticularly true now that the Federal Reserve\nhas resumed tightening policy, a fact evident in\nEMD’s 4.3% drop in response to increasing rate\nhike expectations late last year. Second, with\nspreads standing near two-year lows, there is scope\nfor spread widening based on US and European\npolicy uncertainty and renewed China growth\nfears. Third, countries accounting for 37% of\nEMD—including Mexico, China, South Africa\nand Brazil—have negative outlooks from at least\ntwo rating agencies, raising the potential for\ndowngrades. 119 A potential default by Venezuela\nand its national oil company could also sour\nsentiment, as could unfavorable tariffs or trade\nrestrictions from the new US administration.\nFinally, the backup in interest rates we expect\ncould raise funding costs for EM corporate issuers,\nwhich could also heighten concerns about spillover\ninto EMD. Indeed, a recent stress test by Standard\n& Poor’s revealed that EM corporate borrowers—\nwho must repay $200 billion per year through\n2020 120 —are twice as susceptible to downgrades\nas US corporates if dollar funding costs rise by\na third. 121\nBased on the above, we do not recommend a\ntactical position in EMD at this time.\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n73\nExhibit 94: US Crude Oil Production\nSupply has stabilized after declining by 1 million barrels/day\nfrom its peak.\nExhibit 95: OPEC Crude Oil Production\nOPEC producers have exceeded their quota 90% of the time\nsince 2000.\nMillion Barrels/Day\n2.0\n1.5\n9.6\nMillion Barrels/Day\n10\nMillion Barrels/Day\n36\n34\nOPEC Production Subject to Quota\nHistorical OPEC Quota Levels\n8.8\n9\n32\n1.0\n8.6\n30\n0.5\n8\n28\n0.0\n26\n7\n24\n-0.5\nYoY US Crude Production Change\nUS Crude Production Levels (Right)\n22\n-1.0\nJan-13 Jul-13 Jan-14 Jul-14 Jan-15 Jul-15 Jan-16 Jul-16\n6\n20\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\nData through November 30, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, US Department of Energy.\nData through November 30, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\n2017 Global Commodity Outlook\nAfter losing more than half its value in the span\nof two years, the S&P GSCI broke its downward\ntrend with an 11% gain in 2016, its first doubledigit\nreturn since 2009 (see Exhibit 92). The\nrebound in oil prices was a key contributor, as oil\nfinished the year with a staggering 52% spot price\ngain—an outcome made all the more remarkable\nby the fact that oil was down 25% at its worst\npoint early last year. This strength was not limited\nto the oil patch, as industrial metals rallied 17%\non average and precious metals advanced 8% (see\nExhibit 93).\nDespite last year’s broad-based gains, we are\nmore circumspect about the outlook for 2017.\nWhile we expect oil to advance, it begins the\nyear closer to the midpoint of our target range,\nproviding a more balanced risk/reward profile.\nMeanwhile, we believe the key elements of\nour macroeconomic forecast—Federal Reserve\ntightening, rising interest rates, modest US dollar\ngains and average inflation—represent continued\nheadwinds to gold prices. Comparable headwinds\nexist for industrial metals and agricultural goods,\ngiven the continued slowdown we expect in\nChinese growth.\nWe discuss the specifics of our outlook for oil\nand gold in the sections that follow.\nOil: Regaining Its Balance\nOil is finding its footing again after having\nstumbled dramatically over the last two years.\nWhile the market is still awash in oil inventories,\nthe sizable reductions in capital expenditures by\nthe largest international oil and gas companies\nExhibit 93: Commodity Returns in 2016\nMost commodity subcomponents saw positive returns in 2016, reversing several years of declines.\nS&P GSCI Energy Agriculture Industrial Metals Precious Metals Livestock\nSpot Price Average, 2016 vs. 2015 -10% -14% 0% -6% 8% -17%\nSpot Price Return 28% 48% 3% 19% 9% -10%\nExcess Return* 11% 18% -5% 17% 8% -8%\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\n* Excess return corresponds to the actual return from being invested in the front-month contract and differs from spot price return, depending on the shape of the forward curve.

The same could be said for the dramatic\ncuts in US drilling budgets, which have precipitated\nnotable declines in US shale output (see Exhibit\n94). Lower oil prices have also supported aboveaverage\nglobal demand growth, helping to absorb\nexcess inventories. Lastly, OPEC agreed to\nlower production in November 2016, while also\nsecuring a promise from its significant non-OPEC\ncounterparts to do the same. Taken together, these\ndevelopments support our forecast for moderately\nhigher oil prices in 2017.\nThis balancing act is still precarious, however.\nOil inventories stand well above seasonal averages,\nso failure to honor the announced production\ncuts could delay the recovery in oil prices or, even\nworse, cause renewed declines. The risk of poor\ncompliance is not trivial, given that producers\nhave exceeded their quota 90% of the time by an\naverage of 1 million barrels per day (mmbd) since\n2000 (see Exhibit 95). The pledges from Russia\nand certain smaller non-OPEC producers are\nparticularly suspect, as similar promises to cut their\nOil is finding its footing again after\nhaving stumbled dramatically over\nthe last two years.\nown output along with OPEC have been broken\nin the past.\nMoreover, while the announced cuts are\nsignificant—the OPEC agreement would reduce\nproduction by up to 1.2 mmbd, equivalent to\nabout one year of average global demand growth—\nthey are largely a reversal of production growth\nseen over the last six months (see Exhibit 96).\nMeanwhile, Libya and Nigeria were excluded from\nthese new OPEC quotas given sizable domestic\ndisruptions that have depressed their production.\nRecent signs of improvement, however, suggest a\nrebound in their production cannot be dismissed.\nTherefore, the announced cuts are not a panacea to\nthe current oil imbalance, particularly if US shale\noutput increases meaningfully in response.\nThis last point is important, as US shale\naccounted for 60% of global production growth\nbetween 2012 and 2015 despite representing\nless than 5% of the total output. Although US\nproduction is now declining, two factors may\narrest its slide in 2017. First, the breakeven price\nfor shale drilling has fallen to an average of $50\nper barrel, reflecting a 20% decline in\nproduction costs and improvements to\nthe shale model, including faster drilling,\nlarger wells and better resource recovery.\nIn response, more than 200 oil rigs have\nbeen placed in service since their number\ntroughed in May 2016. 122 Second, capital\nspending by the US energy sector is\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n75\nExhibit 98: Full-Year Average Global Crude Oil\nSupply and Demand\nOil consumption in 2017 could exceed supply for the first\ntime since 2013.\nExhibit 99: Gold Prices and US 10-Year Real\nInterest Rates\nGold prices and real interest rates are closely linked.\nMillion Barrels/Day\n100\n98\n96\n94\n92\nWorld Production\nWorld Consumption\nProduction\nExceeded\nConsumption\nBetween 2014 and 2016\nWorld\nConsumption\nExceeded\nProduction\nAverage Forecast\nSupply/Demand\nForecasts Point to\nSmall Deficit in 2017\n$/Ounce\n2,000\n1,600\n1,200\n%\n-1.5\n-1.0\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n90\n800\n1.5\n88\n86\n400\nGold Price\n10-Year US Real Rate (Right, Inverted)\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n84\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016e 2017f\n0\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n3.5\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, International\nEnergy Agency, OPEC, US Department of Energy, Energy Aspects, PIRA, Bloomberg, Barclays,\nJP Morgan.\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\nvery depressed despite the recent uptick in rigs,\nproviding scope for further increases (see Exhibit\n97). As a result, we expect shale production to\nrecover in 2017, partially offsetting cuts elsewhere.\nDespite these potentially destabilizing forces,\nwe still think the oil market can swing to a small\ndeficit this year. While lower input costs create\nupside risks to US shale production, these costs are\nhighly correlated with oil itself. As a result, today’s\n$50 average breakeven level for shale is likely to\nmove higher with oil prices, limiting the rebound\nin US production. Moreover, even if just half of\nthe proposed production cuts are realized, our\nwork suggests the oil market will still switch into a\ndeficit this year. Finally, OPEC spare capacity has\nbeen largely exhausted by the production increases\nof the last year, while Iran’s production has now\nreturned to pre-sanction levels. In turn, the risk of\nanother disorderly market-share battle has declined\nsignificantly.\nAgainst this backdrop, we expect oil supply\ngrowth to moderate and enable oil demand to\nagain exceed oil production, creating the first\ndeficit since 2013 (see Exhibit 98). With balance\nrestored, we expect oil to trade in a $45–65 range\nin the year ahead. Thus we continue to recommend\nan overweight to US high yield energy bonds\nand US MLPs.\nGold: Still Searching for Its Luster\nGold was not immune from the reversal of fortune\nthat befell interest rates last year, reminding us\nthat their fates are fundamentally linked (see\nExhibit 99). Put simply, higher interest rates raise\nthe opportunity cost of holding gold, since the\nyellow metal generates no cash flow and must\nbe physically stored, often at a cost. A similarly\ninverse relationship exists with the US dollar, as\ninvestors often purchase gold as a hedge against\nthe debasement of fiat currencies; gold has traded\ninversely to the dollar index 73% of the time on an\nannual basis over the last 40 years.\nGiven these relationships, we believe the key\nelements of our macroeconomic forecast—Federal\nReserve tightening, rising interest rates, modest US\ndollar gains and average inflation—will represent\nheadwinds for the yellow metal in 2017. Keep in\nmind that gold prices have declined in four of the\nlast five Federal Reserve tightening cycles, with\nthe only exception occurring during a period of\ndollar weakness in the mid-2000s. Based on these\nprecedents, our expectation of two or three Federal\nReserve rate increases in 2017 does not bode well\nfor gold prices.\n76 Goldman Sachs january 2017\nExhibit 100: Average Annual Gold Prices\nGold remains expensive relative to its inflation-adjusted\nlong-term average price.\n2016 US $/Ounce\n2,000\nAnnual Average Price\nLong-Term Average\nPost Bretton Woods Average\n1,788\n1,743\n1,600\n1,200\n12/31/16\n800\n822\n547\n400\n0\n1871 1885 1899 1913 1927 1941 1955 1969 1983 1997 2011\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\nThe same could be said of continued outflows\nfrom gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Absent a rebound\nin gold prices, these ETF holders might prefer to\nrealize their losses and rotate into instruments with\na yield component. Value-minded investors should\nalso consider that gold prices remains well above\ntheir long-term average (see Exhibit 100).\nDespite this challenging outlook, a number\nof factors could still buoy gold prices in the year\nahead. Emerging market central banks have\ncontinued to buy gold to diversify their reserves.\nMoreover, the stronger global growth we expect\ncould lift jewelry demand, particularly in gold’s\ntwo largest end markets—China and India. Finally,\ngold’s allure as an inflation hedge could come back\ninto focus if the market begins to worry about\neconomic overheating in the US, although this is\nnot our base case.\nIn light of these crosscurrents, we are tactically\nneutral on gold at this time.\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n77\n78 Goldman Sachs january 2017\n2017 OUTLOOK\nIn Closing\nwe do not believe the coming year will bring an end\nto the prolonged run of positive performance for either the\nUS economy or the bull market for equities. Despite greater\nuncertainties, including those tied to a new US administration,\nthe policy backdrop in the US will likely prove particularly\nfavorable for the economy, with looser fiscal policy, still easy\nmonetary policy and a lighter regulatory burden. As these\nfactors diminish the probability of recession in 2017, they\nalso support the case for clients remaining invested in global\nequities at their strategic allocation. We believe US equity\ngains are likely to be modest but still more attractive than the\ncomparable returns of investment alternatives such as cash\nand bonds. And, as last year demonstrated, US equities often\nsurprise to the upside.\nWhile we see the glass as half-full, there is no shortage of\nrisks—some of which have high probability and uncertain\nimpact for the year ahead—that could cause our forecasts for\nthe economy and asset class returns to miss the mark.\nAs always, we will adjust and communicate our views\naccordingly should the economic, financial or geopolitical\nbackdrop change materially over the course of 2017.\nOutlook\nInvestment Strategy Group\n79\nAbbreviations Glossary\nACA: Affordable Care Act\nBEA: Bureau of Economic Analysis\nBIS: Bank for International Settlements\nBLS: Bureau of Labor Statistics\nBOE: Bank of England\nBOJ: Bank of Japan\nCAGR: compound annual growth rate\nCDS: credit default swap\nCFO: chief financial officer\nCFTC: Commodity Futures Trading Commission\nCPI: consumer price index\nEAFE: Europe, Australasia and the Far East\nECB: European Central Bank\nEM: emerging market\nEMD: emerging market dollar debt\nEMLD: emerging market local debt\nEMEA: Europe, the Middle East and Africa\nEMU: European Monetary Union\nEPS: earnings per share\nETF: exchange-traded fund\nFTSE: Financial Times Stock Exchange\nFX: Foreign Exchange\nGBP: British pound\nGDP: gross domestic product\nGFC: global financial crisis\nGIR: [Goldman Sachs] Global Investment Research\nGPIF: Government Pension Investment Fund\nGSCI: Goldman Sachs Commodity Index\nNAHB: National Association of Home Builders\nNATO: North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nNBER: National Bureau of Economic Research\nNIPA: national income and product accounts\nNIRP: negative interest rate policy\nOECD: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\nOPEC: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\nPBOC: People’s Bank of China\nPCE: personal consumption expenditures\nPE: price to earnings\nPPI: Producer Price Index\nPPP: purchasing power parity\nQE: quantitative easing\nS&P: Standard and Poor’s\nTIPS: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities\nTOPIX: Tokyo Price Index\nUK: United Kingdom\nUS: United States\nVAT: value-added tax\nYoY: year-over-year\nIGFI: Investment grade fixed income\nIMF: International Monetary Fund\nISIL: Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\nISM: Institute of Supply Management\nJGB: Japanese government bond\nLBO: leveraged buyout\nLIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate\nLSI: Liquidity Stress Index\nM&A: merger and acquisition\nMLP: master limited partnership\nmmbd: million barrels per day\nMSCI: Morgan Stanley Capital International\nNotes\n1.

For example,\ninvestments that involve futures, equity\nswaps, and other derivatives, as well\nas non-investment grade securities,\ngive rise to substantial risk and are not\navailable to or suitable for all investors.\nWe have described some of the risks\nassociated with certain investments\nbelow. Additional information regarding\nrisks may be available in the materials\nprovided in connection with specific\ninvestments. You should not enter into\na transaction or make an investment\nunless you understand the terms of\nthe transaction or investment and the\nnature and extent of the associated\nrisks. You should also be satisfied that\nthe investment is appropriate for you in\nlight of your circumstances and financial\ncondition.\nAlternative Investments. Alternative\ninvestments may involve a substantial\ndegree of risk, including the risk of total\nloss of an investor’s capital and the use\nof leverage, and therefore may not be\nappropriate for all investors. Private\nequity, private real estate, hedge funds\nand other alternative investments\nstructured as private investment\nfunds are subject to less regulation\nthan other types of pooled vehicles\nand liquidity may be limited. Investors\nin private investment funds should\nreview the Offering Memorandum,\nthe Subscription Agreement and any\nother applicable disclosures for risks\nand potential conflicts of interest.\nTerms and conditions governing private\ninvestments are contained in the\napplicable offering documents, which\nalso include information regarding the\nliquidity of such investments, which may\nbe limited.\nCommodities. Commodity investments\nmay be less liquid and more volatile than\nother investments. The risk of loss in\ntrading commodities can be substantial\ndue, but not limited to, volatile political,\nmarket and economic conditions. An\ninvestor’s returns may change radically\nat any time since commodities are\nsubject, by nature, to abrupt changes\nin price. Commodity prices are volatile\nbecause they respond to many\nunpredictable factors including weather,\nlabor strikes, inflation, foreign exchange\nrates, etc. In an individual account,\nbecause your position is leveraged, a\nsmall move against your position may\nresult in a large loss. Losses may be\nlarger than your initial deposit. Investors\nshould carefully consider the inherent\nrisk of such an investment in light of\ntheir experience, objectives, financial\nresources and other circumstances. No\nrepresentation is made regarding the\nsuitability of commodity investments.\nCurrencies. Currency exchange rates\ncan be extremely volatile, particularly\nduring times of political or economic\nuncertainty. There is a risk of loss when\nan investor as exposure to foreign\ncurrency or are in foreign currency\ntraded investments.\nEmerging Markets and Growth Markets.\nInvesting in the securities of issuers in\nemerging markets and growth markets\ninvolves certain considerations,\nincluding: political and economic\nconditions, the potential difficulty\nof repatriating funds or enforcing\ncontractual or other legal rights, and\nthe small size of the securities markets\nin such countries coupled with a low\nvolume of trading, resulting in potential\nlack of liquidity and in price volatility.\nEquity Investments. Equity investments\nare subject to market risk, which means\nthat the value of the securities may go\nup or down in respect to the prospects\nof individual companies, particular\nindustry sectors and/or general\neconomic conditions. The securities of\nsmall and mid-capitalization companies\ninvolve greater risks than those\nassociated with larger, more established\ncompanies and may be subject to more\nabrupt or erratic price movements.\nFixed Income. Investments in fixed\nincome securities are subject to the\nrisks associated with debt securities\ngenerally, including credit/default,\nliquidity and interest rate risk. Any\nguarantee on an investment grade bond\nof a given country applies only if held\nto maturity.\nNon-US Securities. Investing in non-US\nsecurities involves the risk of loss\nas a result of more or less non-US\ngovernment regulation, less public\ninformation, less liquidity and greater\nvolatility in the countries of domicile\nof the issuers of the securities and/\nor the jurisdiction in which these\nsecurities are traded. In addition,\ninvestors in securities such as ADRs/\nGDRs, whose values are influenced by\nforeign currencies, effectively assume\ncurrency risk.\nTactical Tilts. Tactical tilts may involve\na high degree of risk. No assurance can\nbe made that profits will be achieved\nor that substantial losses will not be\nincurred. Prior to investing, investors\nmust determine whether a particular\ntactical tilt is suitable for them.\nTax Information. Goldman Sachs does\nnot provide legal, tax or accounting\nadvice.
