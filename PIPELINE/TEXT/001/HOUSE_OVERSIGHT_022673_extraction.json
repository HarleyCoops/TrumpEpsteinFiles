A detailed review by a team of BuzzFeed News reporters of \nmore than 2,000 pages of pleadings, depositions, affidavits, police reports, flight logs, and other documents filed in state and federal \ncourt found that many of the most provocative allegations about Clinton have little to no factual foundation and are exaggerated at \nbest; that the documents — which appear to be the source for nearly all current reporting on this subject — themselves never suggest \nthat Clinton was doing more than using his wealthy friend as a kind of global taxi service; and that many of the most lurid insinuations \nhave been floated without any visible support from verifiable information. \nWhile it's still possible that some Rosetta stone of Clintonian depravity will surface from a pair of ongoing lawsuits involving Epstein, the \nfact that nothing even close to that has been dug up over the course of a half-dozen years of heated litigation should not be \nencouraging for Republican operatives and other Clinton critics hotly anticipating the very worst. \nOne sign that the connection is a bit weak: The lawyers who have used the Clinton link to help publicize their cases have been \nmarkedly vague on details. \nWhen asked to present actual proof, Jack Scarola, the Florida attorney responsible for filing some of the most attention-grabbing \ndocuments that have come to light in recent weeks, warned darkly in an email of \"extortionate threats, power, wealth or political \npressure.\" \n\"The time will come when all your questions will be answered,\" said Scarola, who represents another trial attorney suing Epstein in \nPalm Beach County Court. \"But that time is not now.\" \nUnwilling to wait, perhaps, publications on both sides of the Atlantic have gleefully dipped into those documents to publish breathless \ndescriptions of Epstein's \"black book,\" which contains a host of Clinton phone numbers (along with just about every other powerful \nfigure in the Western world); dissections of handwritten flight logs for the financier's private 727 aircraft that frequently capture Bubba \nat 30,000 feet; and extensive allegations from a woman, Virginia Roberts, who claims she was Epstein's sex slave as a teenager and \nwhose recollection places the former commander-in-chief on \"Orgy Island\" in 2002 to participate in a sexual romp, possibly with \nwomen who were not yet of age. \nYORK & 'ORGY ISLAND,' SAYS TEEN SEX SLAVE \nBILL WAS ONE OF \nEPSTEIN'S FREQUENT FLYERS \nNo .1 \nM1M11/ \nvni 6.-•;=.1..L411111111111 IN \n•'IMIMENIMINIIMIIMIMO-\nS-21—\":\" rwill•-ma \n•sarucimem \n!-MIV-46;44FRIA OP \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022675 \nTellingly, many of those articles — which have notably increased in tempo in recent weeks following Roberts' late December accusation \nthat noted attorney Alan Dershowitz was one of the men she was forced to have sex with — contain language underscoring the fact \nthat none of this proves anything. \"It should at this stage be stressed that the Mail has no evidence to corroborate this and other \nclaims made by Virginia Roberts,\" the Daily Mail wrote in April. \"Though her LinkedIn page claims a certificate in Swedish massage, \nthere is no evidence that she ever actually treated Epstein to one,\" Gawker (in the on the \ndocuments to date) wrote last week. And the National Enquirerdid not appear to rely on the court record for its conclusions, instead to \nthe interpretation of who noted that \"Bill's name is all over the legal papers, which are chock-full of sordid claims.\" \nClinton's discretion on matters of sexual restraint has attained permanent notoriety, so maybe it's natural to assume that particular \nleopard doesn't change his spots. But at this point, there is simply nothing to back those sordid claims up. \nHere's what we do know: \nJeffrey Epstein is a secretive billionaire financier and who says he never attended college but whose\" \n\" He in New York, Florida, New Mexico, London, and Paris and also owns an island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nHe has at least two private jets, including the 727. \nHe has known Bill Clinton since about 1995, and his relationship with him grew stronger after he left office. There is no question they \nwere friendly. Epstein's so-called \"black book,\" which is less like something out of the Heidi Fleiss affair and more what most people \nwould call a \"phone directory,\" contains 21 numbers for getting in touch with Clinton, as well as emails and addresses. \nBut that 92-page directory also contains exactly the range of eye-poppingly famous and powerful contacts one might expect of an \nincredibly rich, connected person who owns Manhattan's largest private residence, from Tony Blair to Elie Wiesel to Courtney Love. \nEpstein was long rumored to be a sexual libertine; \"It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do,\" real estate \npersonality Donald Trump of his old friend. \"And many of them are on the younger side.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022676 \nFlorida Dept of Law Enforcement \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022677 \nIMPORTANT MESSAGE \noR tqf/rie--4( \nDATE 6f-5- TIME IY a' AM \u000bP M \n/C .7 - ZqC \nOF \nraEl i‘Ke‘ 1°a\" \nTELEPHONED \tA---- \tPLEASE CALL \nCAME TO SEE YOU \t\\MU CALL AGAIN \n'NANTS TO SEE YOU \tRuSH \nRETWINECI YOUR CALL \tSPECIAL ATTENTION \nME$EHe ha, a \nyou Atu lea( 47! yc,t, \n4-0 -s•Fcc). r ii-S 4 dia il . \n-She X l'S e X eycLyrs \n/ erfa.'7(.1e -.-5-52.1 C-Gree \nre CI 0 1, \n64,y e I c/ t aci \nco \nPalm Beach County Court \nEpstein, in his Florida sex offender photo; at right, a phone message to Epstein from a modeling agent offering Russian lessons from a \n\"2x8\" year old girl. \nIn 2006, that reputation caught up with him, when he was arrested by the Palm Beach Police on charges of sexually molesting \nnumerous underage girls. Police reports in the court record show that detectives found Epstein regularly paid very young women to \ngive him massages that he turned into sexual encounters. He allegedly had a preference for very young women, whom he carefully \ngroomed into increasingly extreme situations, including what some, including Roberts, allege to be sexual slavery. \nIn total, as possible victims of sexual abuse by Epstein, many of them teenagers at the time, including some \nyounger than 14 years old. Epstein was originally charged with a variety of crimes, including sexual assault, rape, and witness \ntampering. \nHe avoided most of those charges as well as federal prosecution in late 2007 by agreeing to plead guilty in Florida court, a deal that \nDershowitz, who was one of Epstein's lawyers, helped negotiate along with an all-star legal lineup that interestingly also included \nfamed Clinton-hunter Ken Starr. \nIn the end, Epstein got 18 months in prison for a single count of soliciting an underage prostitute, of which he served 13 months. He is \nnow a registered sex offender who lists his primary residence as the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nIn a pleading late last month in federal court, attorneys for Roberts allege that \"Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a \nprovision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution.\" Dershowitz has denied these charges vigorously, calling \nthem \"salacious and false\" and, possibly more importantly, \"completely irrelevant\" in a Jan. 12 filing. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022678 \nDespite what some called among the most exhaustive investigations in Palm Beach Police history — which dug up such evidence as an \nAmazon receipt for Epstein's purchase of titles including \"Training With Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Exotic Slaves and Their \nOwners\" — there is nothing in the police record suggesting any other men were involved in Epstein's predatory behavior. \n:. „,.... • •si•lc,::•.. . • , \n!'27;•'?, • ' .4;4;44 \nOillirst Addrtsii; .0. \nPsi= Bead), \nWhey.

One firm bringing some of those cases employed a young lawyer named Bradley \nEdwards, who managed some of the cases. In 2009, a founding partner at the firm, Scott Rothstein, fled the country before ultimately \nreturning to built around recruiting investors to buy stakes in litigation settlements \nthat turned out to be phony. \nAs details of the fraud emerged, Epstein sued Rothstein and Edwards in Palm Beach County Court for racketeering, alleging, among \nother things, that they dangled Bill Clinton's association with Epstein as a lure to investors, implying that settlements would be fast and \nsizable. Epstein ultimately dropped his suit in 2012, but by that time, Edwards had countersued for malicious prosecution and abuse of \nprocess. \nThat case, along with a claim by Virginia Roberts against the federal government over the 2007 prosecution deal in district court (which \nshe filed as a \"Jane Doe\" in 2008), are still pending and are the source of most of the scant information about Clinton that has \nappeared. Scarola, who in the past \nover payments to violent leftist Colombian rebels and won over \nMorgan Stanley (that was later overturned), is the lawyer bringing the suit in county court in West Palm Beach, while Paul Cassell, a \nformer federal judge known for his critical take on mandatory-minimum sentences, mans the federal case four blocks away. \nNeither Cassell nor Edwards responded to requests for comment. \nIt is primarily from pleadings in those cases that the press has been getting a glimpse inside the lifestyle of Epstein, and, by extension, \nClinton. \"Edwards had sound legal basis for believing former President Clinton had relevant and discoverable information,\" part of one \n. Roberts, in her case, \"to be sexually exploited by Defendant's adult male peers, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022679 \nincluding royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances,\" which, Edwards \nelsewhere claims, are \"categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into.\" \nPolice reports entered into the record go into stomach-wrenching detail about Epstein's alleged exploits with the girls and women he \nrecruited and paid for massages that became sexual acts, and mention other women participating as well. Epstein's longtime friend, \nthe socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, is accused of taking part, while his personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, is described procuring young \nwoman for him. \nBut neither of those women has ever said a word about Clinton being involved. Maxwell, for her part, has never been deposed. She \ncanceled a deposition in 2010, claiming she had to return to England indefinitely due to family illness, but was soon thereafter \nphotographed by Us Weekly at Chelsea Clinton's wedding in Rhinebeck, New York. \nThe father of \nthe bride \"was \nnodding his head \nat guests, but \nyou could tell he \nwas nervous,\" \nsays a source. \nView this image \nUs Weekly \nFrom the bling to bi \npart was prepped \nTill' Vemw \nFive hundred guests convent \nWhite—designed, century-ol \nmansion in Rhinebeck for th \nA Awaiting out-of-towners? Fz \nfull of goodies including Cher \nFor her part, Kellen, who won immunity from prosecution along with Epstein in 2007, did sit for a deposition, but repeatedly pleaded \nthe Fifth, refusing to even say if she'd ever even met the former president. \nEpstein's much-discussed flight logs show fairly conclusively that she has. \nA review of the handwritten documents shows Clinton taking 13 trips in Epstein's specially outfitted Boeing 727, including a much-\ndiscussed trip to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. In every single instance, the logs show, Kellen was also on the plane, as \nwas Epstein. That may sound suspicious, except for the fact that Kellen has been described as Epstein's right hand, profoundly involved \nin his professional activities as well as personal ones. Indeed, Doug Band, Clinton's personal aide, was on all but one of the flights the \nformer president took on Epstein's jet. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022680 \nIr..) owe I ••• \nk N-1-- e:S -VA \nKITA V W \nV \\-\n2.Cs Sz \nView this image \nWS SS \nPalm Beach County Court \nI 0.1  \n3-6,6,4,5)( \n, ,sr.pRe,toeNctil.u., Q_Ej• ro,, \n° ,W4741.1,0wirpN,OfivlAw-hr, Te..v5 5 U..11 \ntrvq.

The logs also show him flying with former advisor Ira Magaziner, ex-Transportation Secretary \nRodney Slater, and fashion model Naomi Campbell. \nThe pilots' documents also leave numerous and — understandably — intriguing questions unanswered: Clinton was on four flights with \nwomen identified as only \"Janice\" and \"Jessica,\" who have not been identified; he once flew with a person identified only as \"one \nfemale\" and also, during part of the trip throughout Africa, a young woman named Chauntae Davies, who appears in Epstein's phone \ndirectly under the massage category and whose expertise in Swedish massage was described in Gawkels story mentioning her last \nweek. And because the entries are hand-written in a very cramped log form, it's impossible to know if important names ended up \nillegible or left out altogether, nor if there are other logs that have not been revealed. \nBut based on what's in the court files, there are no further clues about those flights, other than the testimony and public statements of \nRoberts, who has described the airplane as a kind of high-altitude Gomorrah. What is on the record is a deposition of Larry Visoski, one \nof Epstein's former pilots, who recalls having Clinton on his plane as many as 20 times. When asked, \"Do you remember him being on \nthe airplane with younger girls?\" Visoski replies, simply, \"No.\" \nClinton flew literally around the world with Epstein, traveling from New York to London, to Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Morocco, \nPortugal, Russia, and throughout Africa. In almost every case, according to cross-referenced information on his speaking engagements, \nClinton was apparently traveling for professional reasons, and, according to the logs, he never flew with his wealthy friend anywhere \nnear the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nThat does little to bolster statements by Roberts, who in a 2011 conversation with her lawyers (which both New York Posts Page Six \nand Radar Online described as an \"interview\") claimed Clinton traveled to Epstein's infamous retreat on Little St. James Island in 2002. \nEarlier this month, it was reported that Roberts is writing a \"tell-all\" memoir about her experiences. In a sworn affidavit filed in court \nlast week, she claimed to have had sex with Epstein, Dershowitz, England's Prince Andrew, and several other men on numerous \noccasions, and portrayed a three-year period ending in 2002 when Epstein passed her off to his friends continually. But, she added, \"I \nhave never had sexual relations with Clinton, nor have I claimed to have had such relations. I have never seen him have sexual \nrelations with anyone.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022681 \nMUlI1I IltitLI MAW( Cvuryuung CIVIAILMC mat W/L1 new prevem mare timuiar 413USLI. \n53.

In fact, the logs show all of Clinton's \nflights came in 2002 and 2003, with not a single appearance aloft recorded in 2004 or 2005. \nThe closest potential link to Clinton in the period closer to Epstein's fall, the public record suggests, comes from one of his longtime \nconfidants, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. \nThe flight logs indicate Summers flew on Epstein's jet as far back as 1998, but also on April 15, 2004, September 14, 2005, and \nDecember 21, 2005. The final trip came 10 days after Summers got married, and the log for the flight — from Bedford, Massachusetts, \nto the Virgin Islands — shows what appears to be his new bride on board, as well as Ghislaine Maxwell, but not Epstein. \n7if \ntfixt.: \tTcs \tec-x, \t*-p. \tGm t..v \n2.1 \tIt \tii \tfici, \tT )6 T \t*16. \nm Lam./ 4.-Loor swow...e, LV \nA',1es \tti \t' k \t1-t--5- \tfoe!, _ \tit,it \ta \u000bz.6.:, N M c v \nView this image \nPalm Beach County Court \nEpstein was a significant donor to Harvard University, of which Summers was president at the time. According to a spokesperson for \nSummers, on a few occasions when Epstein was flying to where Summers was also traveling, he accepted rides on the billionaire's jet. \nAttorneys in the two cases have attempted to get the court to permit discovery from Clinton himself, but have been stymied by motions \nfrom Epstein's lawyers. Court records show they have also tried unsuccessfully to depose Donald Trump, former New Mexico Gov. Bill \nRichardson, former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, and magician David Copperfield. Notably, a list of 73 proposed witnesses in \nRoberts' trial does not include Clinton. \nThe tale of Epstein and his sexual activities is undoubtedly a fascinating, and harrowing, one. But with the star witness in one case \nswearing under oath that she has no such evidence, and everyone else in a position to know keeping their mouths firmly shut, it is at \nthis point extremely difficult to draw even a hazy, crooked, dotted line between Epstein's depredations, in the bedroom or aloft, and \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton. \nBuzzFeed News reporters Alex Campbell, Kyle Blaine, and Megan Apper contributed to this report. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022682 \nKathryn H.
