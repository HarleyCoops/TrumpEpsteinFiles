decrease UNFPA is experiencing as the US pulled all their funding under president Trump, and the European countries have re-directed their funding to deal with the migrant influx, there is a funding shortfall leading to Female Condom stock outs in countries. \n\nThe Female Health Company is looking for donors who are willing to donate money to UNFPA, and earmark that money for purchase of the FC2 female condom only, so that they can purchase the FC2 female condom for the following countries:\nUganda : 3 million units\t\tGhana: 1 million units\nBotswana: 1 million units\t\tTunesia: 1 million units\nSierra Leone: 500,000 units\t\tBolivia: 500,000 units\nTanzania: 1 million units\t\tHaiti: 500,000 units\nEthiopia: 1 million units\t\tCongo DR: 2 million units\n\n                    \n

million\nFC is 3%-6% of FP2020  condom market and 0,3%-0,6% of global condom market\n\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\nCustomers and Distribution\nKey purchasers:\n▪ Global

female initiated method that provides triple protection against STIs including HIV and Zika and against unplanned pregnancy\nIntroduction of male and female condoms in the same market leads to more overall protected sex acts\nCost effective, positive return on investment\n\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\nHIV/AIDS global overview\n• No. 1 cause of death globally for women age 15-44\n• 80% of female cases contracted via heterosexual transmission\n• Male and female condoms are the only prevention products available\n\n                                        Worldwide, women represent >50% of new  \n                                        Adult HIV/AIDS infections\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\nThe social case for FC2\nEmpowering women as a development tool by decreasing maternal mortality & fewer unwanted pregnancies and protecting from HIV-infection, and other STIs\n\n  ▪ Worldwide 215 million women who like to plan or limit number of children have no access to contraception\n  ▪ Worldwide 21.6 million unsafe abortions cause 5 million women hospitalized each year, and account for 13 % of maternal deaths\n  ▪ Worldwide women and girls account for slightly more than half of all HIV infections\n  ▪ In sub-Saharan Africa 23 million people live with HIV/AIDS: over 12 million are women and nearly 2.5 million are children\n\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\nThe product case for fc2\nOnly FDA and WHO approved Female Condom and as a result approved for bulk procurement by UNFPA and USAID\nThe strong preference for FC2 due to its non allergenic material nitrile and long standing reputation\nFC2 is has been distributed to 144 countries. \nThe backup support, materials, training provided by FHC\n\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\nThe product case for fc2 (2)\n5) The FC2 female condom, as opposed to the latex male condom, is made out of Nitrile which holds many benefits: \n- Three times stronger than latex, \n- Can be used by people who are latex sensitive, or allergic\n- Can hold both water and oil based lubricants (latex tears with oil)\n- Can be inserted hours in advance \n- Transfers body heat ensuring a more natural sensation\n\n6) The FC2 is hormone free, which means that it does not have the side effects of  some hormone based contraceptives.\n\n7) Preferable alternative to a male condom, according to males\n▪ Men don’t have to wear it\n▪ Not tight/restricting\n▪ Can be inserted in advance of sexual activity\n\n\n\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\nDebunking myths & Misconceptions\nCertain Myths and Misconceptions among decision still exist today, even though the evidence tells otherwise\n\nIt is too expensive\nThere is no demand\nWe already have male condoms and LARCs so the FC is not necessary\nMen do not like the product, and without them it will never succeed\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\n1) It is too Expensive: false\n                    “The Business Case for Female Condoms” \n                    (Global Health Visions, 2014)\n\nReturn on investment of female condom procurement for governments through 2 ways:\nCost savings to the health system, by focussing on prevention instead of treatment\nEconomic productivity losses averted, as more women are able to join the workforce. \n\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\nThe business case for female condoms (2)\n\tThe Business case for female condoms found that for every $1,- invested in buying female condoms in Kenya a return of $1,94 is made. In Nigeria for every $1,- invested a return of $3,20 is made. See table below for health benefits. \n\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\n2) There is no demand: False\nUruguay Study, UNFPA Uruguay and MOH Uruguay (2017):\n- 77% of average women said the FC2 was good or very good\nStudy participants cited greater comfort and practicality and greater protection and safety as the two main advantages of the FC2\n- 81% said they would continue using the FC2 in the future\n- 64 % said they experienced no difficulties at all\n\nSouth Africa National Female Condom Program \nEvaluation (2017)\n- 80% of women feld the FC put them in charge\n- The level of unprotected sex declined from 43,3 % at baseline\n to 8,4 % at 12 months after the introduction of the FC\n\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\n3) We already have other commodities: False\nAIGHD Research on the Female Condom in Mozambique (2017)\n                    The increase in female condom use was not accompanied by an\n                    off-setting decrease in ever or current use of alternative methods.\n                    If anything, current use of male condoms and other modern\n                    contraceptives increased slightly in the treatment group. Female condoms thus seemed to complement the existing choice set of regular contraceptives\n\nSouth Africa National Female Condom Program Evaluation (2017)\n                     Of the current FC users 73,4% reported using condoms in general more often than before they started using the female condom. \n\n\n\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\n4) Men do not like the product: false\nSouth Africa National Female Condom Program Evaluation (2017)\n\n\n- At their one month interview 58% of men said that the FC was better or much better than the MC and at 12 months this rose to 74%\n- At six months into the research 97% of women reported that their partners were supportive of using the FC\n\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\nIn summary\nFemale Condoms provide a return on investment\nFemale Condoms are in high demand with both men and women, average and key populations\nFemale Condoms increase the overall use of barrier methods and contraceptives, enforcing  decrease in overall number of unprotected sex acts\n\n\n                    \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\foleObject1.bin\n\n\n\n\n\fChart1\n\nFemale\t\nMale\t\n 0.52\t\n 0.48\t\n\n\n\n\n\fSheet1\n\n  \tColumn1\t\nFemale\t 52%\t\nMale\t 48%\t\n  \tTo resize chart data range, drag lower right corner of range.\t\n\n\nColumn1\n52%\nFemale\n48%\nMale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fimage14.emf\n\n\n52%\nFemale 48%\nMale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fimage16.emf\n\n\n1,000,000 female \ncondoms  Cameroon  Kenya  Myanmar  Nigeria \n# DALYs averted  9,292  9,713  4,122  9,488 \n# of unintended \npregnancies \naverted  1,939  1,939  1,939  1,939 \n#of HIV infections \naverted  108  125  62  100 \n#of maternal \ndeaths averted  8  4  2  7 \n#of infant deaths \naverted  53  39  14  77 \n#of unsafe \nabortions averted  243  265  521  213 \n \n\n\n\n"
