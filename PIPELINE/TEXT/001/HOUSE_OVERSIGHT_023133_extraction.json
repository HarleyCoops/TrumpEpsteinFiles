Nur\nLaiq laboriously and faithfully collected most of the relevant documents and contributed\nto the organization of the book and the drafting of the introduction and comments.\nFabrice Aidan, a French diplomat, who served for ten years as my special\nassistant and political adviser in my different United Nations capacities played an\ninstrumental role for the production of this volume. He made essential substantive\ninputs to the organization and compilation of the documents and the composition of\nthe comments, throughout the book, as well as to the introduction. David Makovsky\nand Marwan Muasher deserve thanks for reviewing the book and for providing\ninsightful comments.\nI would like also to thank my staff at the International Peace Institute (IPI), Walter\nKemp and Adam Lupel, for their editing contribution. Miklos Pinther, former chief\nUN cartographer, who in 2000 oversaw the delineation of the Blue Line between Israel,\nLebanon and Syria, compiled and produced the maps in this volume. Finally, my\nexecutive assistant, Jilla Moazami, gave invaluable administrative support. Without\nthese colleagues, the book would have never come to print. I am delighted that the\nvolume came to its conclusion on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the signing of\nthe Oslo Accords of 1993.\nI am grateful to the Government of Norway for generous support to the International\nPeace Institute’s (IPI) Middle East program over many years.\nI dedicate the book to my beloved wife, Ambassador Mona Juul, my companion in\nwar and peace, without whom I would never have become involved in the imbroglio of\nthe Middle East.\nParis\n16 September 2013\nTerje Rød-Larsen\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 12/9/2014, SPi\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 12/9/2014, SPi\nContents\nAbout the Editors\nList of Maps\nList of Abbreviations\nA Chronology of the Arab–Israeli Conflict\nThe Crooked Course: Step by Step on the Path to Peace\nMaps\nxiv\nxvi\nxvii\nxviii\nxxix\nxlii\nPart I.

It runs a crooked\ncourse. This work provides a paper trail of the meandering and rocky path of the peace\nprocess. Relevant documents related to the Arab–Israeli conflict over the past century\n(since the Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916) are compiled in this book. It provides an\nannotated and chronological overview of attempts to make peace in one of the most\ndifficult and protracted conflicts in the world, and it includes a full set of accompanying\nmaps specially made for this edition.\nThe sheer volume of such a work raises the critical problem of how to present the\ndocuments in a way that facilitates their accessibility and understanding. A simple\nchronological ordering would miss important connections between the documents,\nwhich are thus better grouped by common theme. To this end, we have divided the\nvolume into five thematic Parts. Part I compiles documents related to the formal peace\nagreements between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as those related to Israel’s\nunilateral disengagement from Gaza. The documents in Part II relate to the many\ninformal peace proposals and ideas offered over the years that have served to contribute\nto more official processes at a later date. Part III compiles the many important United\nNations documents specifically related to the question of Palestine. Part IV sets the\nIsraeli–Palestinian issue in a broader context, providing regional papers going back a\ncentury, up to the latest documents. Finally, Part V compiles Israeli and Palestinian\ndomestic documents relevant to the quest for peace in the Middle East.\nGrouping the documents by theme highlights the evolution of particular aspects of\nthe conflict and the peace process over time. When examined as a group, these\ndocuments provide valuable insights on the events, conditions, and actions that have\nbeen most important in influencing the different phases of the peace process.\nFor guidance, the reader will find a chronological overview of all the documents and\nkey events.\nON PART I: PEACE AGREEMENTS AND THE\nDISENGAGEMENT FROM GAZA\nNothing about the quest for peace in the Middle East has been simple or easily attained.\nMerely bringing Palestinians and Israelis together was a feat that took decades to\nachieve. Despite all the efforts exerted by not only the principal parties, but also local\nactors, regional neighbors, and international players, agreements between the two sides\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nxxx\nThe Crooked Course\nhave been scarce. This Part chronicles the rare moments when both Israeli and\nPalestinian negotiators put pen to paper in an effort to resolve a conflict that has\nseemed intractable.\nPart I begins with the Oslo peace talks, which in 1993 produced the Declaration of\nPrinciples (DoP) and the mutual recognition of the State of Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian\npeople. These two agreements formed the basis for all subsequent talks between the\nparties.\nIn 1992, as the director of the Norwegian research institute Fafo, I initiated, together\nwith then member of Knesset Yossi Beilin, secret talks between him and local Palestinian\nleader Faisal Husseini, at the American Colony Hotel in Jerusalem. These talks, which\nwere facilitated by Fafo and the Foreign Ministry of Norway, reached a dead end later that\nyear. The Norwegians realized that without involving the exiled and outlawed Palestinian\nleadership in Tunis, nothing could be accomplished. At the time, both Israeli and\nAmerican citizens were forbidden to engage with any member of the PLO. In December\n1992, I flew to Tunis to meet for the first time with PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat. In that\nmeeting in his villa, in the darkness of the early morning hours, he authorized the head of\nFatah’s financial wing, Ahmed Qorei (alias Abu Ala), to travel to Oslo for secret talks\nfacilitated by Fafo in cooperation with the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. The first meeting\ntook place at Borregaard Manor outside Oslo, in January 1993.\nFrom January to May 1993, secret talks were conducted as a pre-negotiation phase,\nin parallel to the Madrid process taking place in Washington. The goals of prenegotiations\nin Oslo were twofold: to build trust between the Palestinian and Israeli\nrepresentatives; and to explore possible parameters of an agreement. In order to reach\nthe first goal, the exercise was restricted to a small group, willing to engage in secret\nintense interaction over a lengthy period. Unlike the massive delegations in Washington,\nthe delegations in Oslo were never larger than three to five people on each side,\nwith continued interaction often from dawn to dusk.\nIn Oslo, the Palestinians were represented from day one by a delegation of the PLO,\nhandpicked by its chairman, Yasir Arafat. The rationale behind this unprecedented\nstep was that the Norwegians had discovered that the PLO was already controlling\nevery detail, albeit invisibly, of the bilateral and multilateral talks in Washington.\nFurthermore we believed that if the PLO and Yasir Arafat were not directly involved\nin the talks, they still had the ability and the will to block any agreement. Allowing\nothers to reach an agreement would be tantamount to political suicide by the PLO.\nTherefore, it was necessary to have them at the table. Without them, no agreement\ncould be reached.\nThe pre-negotiation phase ended on 1 May 1993. The talks had reached a point\nwhere both parties believed that the other was negotiating in good faith and that an\nagreement had to take the shape of a declaration of principles. On that date, the head of\nthe Palestinian negotiation team, Ahmed Qorei, invited me for a walk in the hills above\nOslo. He made it clear—in the most explicit of words—that the PLO would not\ncontinue into a final round of talks unless the Israelis “upgraded” their delegation to\nhigh-level officials. Up to this point, the Israelis were represented by two academics\n(Ron Pundak and Yair Hirschfeld) who did not hold any formal position in the\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nThe Crooked Course\nxxxi\ngovernment. In the following days, I flew to Israel to convey the request to Yossi Beilin,\nthen Deputy Foreign Minister. Shortly afterwards, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres\ndispatched the Director General of the ministry, Uri Savir, and the head of the\nministry’s legal department, Joel Singer, to Oslo. The Norwegians had, until then,\nseen the secret talks in Oslo and their potential outcome only as possible inputs to the\nnegotiations in Washington. We were puzzled—and pleasantly surprised—to realize\nthat the parties now wanted to negotiate the full deal under the Oslo framework.\nIndeed, in the spring of 1993 the parties started to conduct proper negotiations in\nOslo—out of the public eye—rather than through the formal process in Washington.\nWithin four months, the Declaration of Principles was initialed in a secret ceremony in\nthe Government Guest House in Oslo. This was followed by a new set of secret\nnegotiations in Paris, facilitated by the Norwegian team (Johan Jorgen Holst, Jan\nEgeland, Mona Juul, and myself). The outcome was the mutual recognition of the\nState of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which paved the way for the\nformal signing of the Oslo Accords on the White House lawn on 13 September 1993.\nThe Declaration of Principles was based on the approach that the easiest issues\nshould be resolved first, with remaining issues to be addressed later, step-by-step. A\nPalestinian Authority for self-rule would be established, first gaining control over Gaza\nand Jericho, and then gradually expanding into the West Bank. The details of the\nexpansion were to be hammered out in the so-called Oslo II Agreement, signed in\nCairo on 28 September 1995.\nAs unique and effective as this approach proved to be, the Oslo Accords would not\nhave been possible without the dramatic changes taking place within the international\nsystem at the time. The PLO had been financially dependent on the states of the Arab\nGulf and the Communist bloc. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Arafat’s support of\nSaddam Hussein during the Gulf War of 1991 resulted in the collapse of funding for the\nPLO and an end to remittances to Palestinian families in Gaza and the West Bank.\nSimultaneously, the first Intifada between 1987 and 1993 and the emergence of a new\nlocal leadership in Gaza and the West Bank created a threat to the leadership of the\nPLO in exile in Tunis. The organization needed desperately to regain its financial\nfooting, as well as its political stature. These were major incentives to move the\nOrganization into what was to become the Oslo process.\nThe Israeli leadership also had its reasons to come to the negotiating table. The rise\nof satellite television channels, such as CNN, beamed live images around the world of\nIsraeli soldiers armed to the teeth combating stone-throwing kids in Gaza and the West\nBank. Support for the government of Israel dropped dramatically in Europe and at\nhome. Israelis began to feel that they were losing the moral high ground. Israeli leaders\nsaw that using traditional military means to combat the Intifada came at a high political\nand moral cost. They too were in search of a political way out. In short, the Oslo\nchannel came precisely at the right time, providing a lifeline for both the Israeli and\nPalestinian leaderships.\nThe implementation of the Declaration of Principles started in earnest in 1994, with\nYasir Arafat’s spectacular arrival in Gaza and the rapid establishment of the Palestinian\nAuthority. I had the pleasure of welcoming him on behalf of UN Secretary-General\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, as his newly appointed Special Coordinator for the Occupied\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nxxxii\nThe Crooked Course\nTerritories and Personal Representative to the PLO and the Palestinian Authority at\nour new headquarters in Gaza city. The PLO had regained its uncontested leadership,\nand the Palestinian Authority received a massive financial boost with the influx of\ndonor money from across the world. Israel received a moral boost as a large number of\ncountries formally recognized its existence and established diplomatic relations.\nA hallmark of the Declaration of Principles was the establishment of a gradual\napproach to resolving the conflict. Gradualism now became the keyword for describing\nthe peace process. By breaking the overall goal of peace into manageable sections that\ncould be addressed in sequence, the Oslo process allowed for progress to be made and\ntrust to develop on less contentious issues before tackling more controversial topics like\nJerusalem, borders, security arrangements, and refugees, which could threaten to derail\nany talks.\nOne of the principal advantages of the step-by-step or gradualist approach was that\nit enabled the parties to reach compromises through ongoing dialogue and interaction\nwith each other by starting with the easiest issues and leaving the hardest for last. It\nallowed for an incremental change in perceptions and political positions. Although\ngradualism allowed success to be achieved in a variety of areas, moving the process\nforward, at each stage, depended on the parties taking the bold steps necessary to fulfill\ntheir respective commitments. The main weakness was slow movement in implementation,\nwith progress falling behind agreed upon timelines. This led to periodic\ndisillusionment and back-sliding.\nA recurrent problem was that the parties had failed to agree on a mechanism to\npenalize non-compliance. This critical deficiency undermined progress. As leaders and\nthe political climate changed, so too did the resolve to implement.\nSuccessful gradualism required the use of ambiguous language on the most contentious\nissues: Jerusalem, borders, security, and refugees. The successive Israeli governments\nand the Palestinian leadership had substantially different views on the final\nstatus of all four of these issues. The language contained within the Oslo documents, as\nwell as subsequent agreements, provides room for interpretation. Either side could\nclaim that the text represents their interests. This allowed leaders to go home to their\nrespective constituents and retain popular support.\nAnother practice that proved effective was the use of the annexes attached to agreements\nto flesh out disruptive details, or to substantially water down the impact of\ncertain commitments made within the body of the text. In many cases the annexes are\nexhaustively long and detailed but are rarely read by the public, affording the leaders\npolitical space to make agreements that might otherwise face public criticism.\nThe three Israeli Prime Ministers who were in office from 1993 to 1999—Rabin,\nPeres, and Netanyahu—approached the challenges of peace through a concept of\ngradualism, postponing the tricky final status issues. Barak, who took office in 1999,\nwas the first Israeli Prime Minister to address the final status head-on with a “totalist”\napproach (read below).\nWhile the Oslo process was based on the concept of gradualism, characterized by\nbilateral negotiations—facilitated by a third party—and cumulative small steps demonstrating\ngood faith, Ariel Sharon eventually took a contrary approach through\n“uncompromising unilateralism”. The day after he won the election in February 2001,\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nThe Crooked Course\nxxxiii\nhe invited me to meet him at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. During the course of\nthe conversation, he surprisingly asked what I would do with the peace process if I were\nhim. I had just re-read his autobiography, Warrior, and answered: “Both as a soldier\nand as a politician, you have a history of being bold, daunting, daring and making\nsurprise moves. In that spirit, I would suggest that you dismantle the settlements and\npull your troops completely out of Gaza.” For a minute I worried that this would anger\nhim, but he answered very calmly. “I cannot do it.” I asked why. He said: “Because of\nthe harbor.” I replied, rather perplexed: “But there is no harbor in Gaza.” He said:\n“That’s not the point. They could build one if we left Gaza.” Then I realized that,\ncontrary to common opinion, Sharon had no ideological inhibitions about leaving\nGaza. His concerns were only about security. This gave me high hopes that he would\neventually do it. Three years of stalemate were to follow. And then in December 2003,\nout of the blue, Sharon made the sweeping and stunning pronouncement that Israel\nwould leave Gaza and end its occupation of the Strip.\nAriel Sharon deserves praise for withdrawing from Gaza. But his unilateral move\nundermined the possibility of peaceful relations between the inhabitants of the Gaza\nStrip and Israel. The PLO and the Palestinian Authority were sidelined. They could not\nclaim credit for the move, and thus had scant motivation for supporting it. Instead,\nmilitants in Gaza and the West Bank harvested all the benefits. The Disengagement\nplan undermined those on the Palestinian side who claimed that the negotiating table\nwas a more efficient tool than the barrel of a gun in order to resolve the conflict.\nON PART II: PEACE PROPOSALS AND IDEAS\nThe formal agreements covered in Part I represent the conclusions of long and complex\ndiplomatic processes. Part II encompasses proposals and ideas that contributed to\nbreaking taboos and changing opinions that paved the way for precedent-setting\nagreements.\nIn the late 1970s and 1980s several plans and initiatives were put forward which\nmaintain relevance for the future of the peace process. One idea was a comprehensive\nand unified Arab approach which was first proposed in the Fahd Plan (1981), and later\nrefined in the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002. The latter peace proposal promoted by\nthen Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah al-Saud represented a unified shift in the Arab\nStates’ approach to Israel. Where there was once rejection, the Arab peace initiative\ncreated the possibility of universal recognition of the State of Israel. All 57 countries of\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) endorsed the initiative.\nThe aftermath of the Gulf War of 1991 opened new opportunities to address the\ncomplex issue of peace in the Middle East. This was the backdrop for the groundbreaking\nMadrid Peace Conference, convened by the United States and the Soviet Union. It\nraised new hopes for peaceful resolution to the enduring conflicts of the region. The\nconference created an unprecedented platform for peace talks, based on the principle of\n“land for peace”. The Israelis would have to cede land to their Arab adversaries in\nreturn for peace and security. The Madrid formula for organizing such talks followed a\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nxxxiv\nThe Crooked Course\ntwo-track approach: bilateral negotiations in Washington; and the formation of several\nmultilateral working groups to address specific issues such as water, refugees, the\neconomy, etc. It is worth noting that the PLO was not accepted at the negotiating\ntable. Instead the Palestinians were represented by a joint delegation of Jordanian\nofficials and prominent Palestinians, who allegedly were not associated with the PLO.\nIn stark contrast to the Oslo process, the Washington talks under the Madrid formula\nwere public and in the constant glare of the media. This resulted in the parties\ncontinuously posturing to win the favor of the complex power structures that they\nreported to, as well as of domestic public constituencies. However, Madrid broke the\ntaboo of direct bilateral talks between Arabs and Israelis. Madrid failed as a process, but\nsucceeded as a spectacular event for creating hope, and formed a springboard for the\nsubsequent secret Oslo talks.\nAs noted in the comments on Part I, Oslo and all subsequent agreements were\nembraced by the three Israeli Prime Ministers before Ehud Barak took office in 1999.\nAs opposed to the gradualist approach of his predecessors, Barak took the path of\ntotalism, i.e. aiming at solving all remaining issues in one go. Pursuant to this approach,\nas he put it: “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”. Heroically, he wanted to\nresolve simultaneously all matters with Lebanon, Syria, and the Palestinians, and put a\nfinal end to all conflicts.\nShortly after his election, I was invited to meet him at his home in the outskirts of Tel\nAviv. He described his new approach metaphorically: “In order to resolve a problem,\nyou need to analyze what the problem is, and define your objective. The problem at\nhand is that we have an ugly dog in front of us. The objective is to beautify the dog. In\norder to do so, you need to analyze why it is ugly. And then you see that it is the tail that\nmakes the dog ugly. Through this analysis, our task becomes easy: by chopping off the\ntail we will have a beautiful dog.” And then he added sarcastically: “But I will not chop\noff the tail of the dog the way you Oslo people have been doing it, painfully slice by slice\nlike a salami. We need to chop it off all in one go.”\nIn this spirit, in the summer of 2000 President Clinton brought the parties to the\npresidential estate at Camp David for marathon talks behind closed doors. The attempt\nfailed for many reasons. First of all, a few weeks of talks did not provide ample time to\naddress the thorniest issues (Oslo took six months of negotiation to address the least\ndifficult issues). Other reasons were internal Palestinian disagreements and difficult\ninterpersonal relations, in addition to a “take-it-or-leave it” approach by Israel.\nAlthough the leaders left Camp David without diplomatic feathers in their cap,\nPresident Clinton and his team now had a clear sense of what was needed to bridge\nthe gap between the two parties. In late December 2000, he presented what became\nknown as the Clinton Parameters. They were a comprehensive set of American ideas\non how to end the conflict. However, time was not on the side of peace. With his second\nterm coming to an end, Clinton was unable to persuade the parties to conclude an\nagreement. In addition, Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount /\nHaram al-Sharif in September 2000 signaled the second Palestinian uprising. This\nreduced the room for maneuver for the Palestinian negotiators.\nFollowing the election of George W. Bush as President of the United States, and\nagainst the backdrop of the new Intifada, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators gathered in\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nThe Crooked Course\nxxxv\nearly 2001 in the small Egyptian seaside town of Taba. They attempted, through\nbilateral talks, to capitalize on the basic ideas put forward by President Clinton. In\nspite of high hopes inspired by the Taba talks, hope was dashed by Israeli intransigence,\nreinforced by the violent uprising across the West Bank and Gaza, as well as internal\ntensions within the Palestinian leadership.\nIn an attempt to revive the peace process, President George W. Bush, in a speech in\nthe Rose Garden in June 2002, took the bold step of publicly declaring support for an\nindependent Palestinian state. However, he was convinced that Chairman Arafat was\nan impediment to peace, due to the continuing violence against Israelis emanating\nfrom Gaza and the West Bank. The President made further US involvement in peace\nnegotiations contingent upon Arafat’s removal from power, and the implementation of\ndemocratic reforms in the Palestinian Authority’s political structure. This was consistent\nwith Prime Minister Sharon’s policies. At this time, parts of the Palestinian\nleadership either passively turned a blind eye to the rise of bombings in Israel, or\ndiscreetly encouraged it. Arafat became a pariah for several essential players and was\nisolated in his Muqata headquarters in Ramallah.\nUnder these dire circumstances, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for a\nmeeting in the conference room of his executive office at United Nations’ Headquarters\nin New York with the US, Russia, and the European Union. The frustration was deep\namongst all parties. Bilateral talks did not happen. Trilateral talks did not work. In\nresponse to the breakdown of the peace process, he suggested that the four actors\ncoordinate a position to restart the process. The idea was to combine the political\npower of the US, Russia’s credibility amongst key Arab states, the European Union’s\nfinancial muscle, and the UN’s legitimacy in a potent new international coalition. The\nUN Secretary-General coined the phrase the “Middle East Quartet” for this informal\ngroup. The Quartet met both at principals level and at the level of special envoys.\nA novel approach to the imbroglio of Middle East peacemaking was launched:\nmultilateral unilateralism. The concept was launched at a Quartet Envoys’ working\ndinner at the Norwegian Ambassador’s residence in Herzliya (a suburb of Tel Aviv) by\nUS officials William Burns and David Satterfield. The idea was for the Quartet\nmembers to collectively produce an operational peace plan to be presented to the\nparties for implementation, without prior consultation. This resulted in the Quartet\npeace plan, referred to as the Road Map, which was eventually presented to the parties\nas an ultimatum in 2003. In other words, a unified position was imposed by a group of\nthird parties upon the disputants—thus, multilateral unilateralism.\nThe Quartet collectively submitted the text to Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud\nAbbas. The US ambassador to Israel presented it to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,\nwho refused to meet with the Quartet as a whole. The Palestinian side accepted the\nproposals in total while the Israeli side came up with fourteen reservations.\nThe Oslo Accords mapped a path towards a possible peace agreement, setting up\nmilestones to be passed along the way, and stipulating that the ride on this bumpy road\nwould take five years. It did not define the end point of the journey, because the parties\nwere not capable of closing the gaps between their positions at the time. The 2003\nPerformance-Based Road Map of the Quartet was, in many ways, the paper that\nconcluded the Declaration of Principles of 1993, by designating the last milestone,\nthe establishment of a Palestinian state.\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nxxxvi\nThe Crooked Course\nHowever, compromises among the Quartet members led to ambiguities which gave\nthe parties the opportunity to make radically different interpretations of their obligations\nunder the plan. The Israeli side claimed that the Road Map called for security first—a\ncomplete end of Palestinian violence—before any negotiations could start. This strategy\nwas called sequentialism. The Palestinian side, and the international community at large,\nsupported a strategy of parallelism that called for progress on both security and political\nissues to happen in lock-step. The collision of the concepts of parallelism and sequentialism\nmade it impossible to reach the final destination envisioned in the Road Map.\nWith gridlock in the formal negotiating process, civil society groups tried to take the\ninitiative. One example of several is the Geneva Accords of December 2003 led by PLO\nofficial Yasser Abed Rabbo and former Israeli Minister Yossi Beilin.\nThe stalemate in the process continued until Ehud Olmert’s election as Prime\nMinister in 2006. Through intense negotiations facilitated by US Secretary of State\nCondoleezza Rice and her team, the parties came close to striking a deal which would\nhave pushed the peace process forward. However, as the end game of this phase of the\nnegotiations, also known as the Annapolis process, unfolded, Prime Minister Olmert\nhad to step down because of an indictment for alleged financial misconduct. At the\nsame time also, a new wave of rockets emanating from Gaza, lead to a military\noperation in the Strip (Operation ‘Cast Lead’).\nThe scene and characters changed in early 2009 with the election of Barack Obama\nas President of the United States, and Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel\nfor a second time. Shortly after his inauguration, President Obama attempted to\nresuscitate the peace process with the appointment of a new high-level special envoy,\nSenator George Mitchell. An absolute freeze on settlements, including in Jerusalem,\nwas made a precondition for bringing the parties to the table. This turned out to be a\nself-defeating proposal. For any Israeli Prime Minister, such a major move could only\nbe the result of, and not the pre-condition for, negotiations.\nDuring this paralysis, the Palestinian leadership looked for alternative ways of\nmoving forward, and shifted their strategy from bilateralism to unilateralism through\na bid to upgrade the Palestinian status to be on a par with the Vatican at the United\nNations: that of an observer Member State in the General Assembly. This quest reached\nits climax during the UN General Assembly sessions of 2011 and 2012. In a speech to\nthe General Assembly in September 2011, President Abbas called for admission of\nPalestine as a Member State of the United Nations. It reflected the growing frustration\namong the Palestinian community with the lack of progress since the end of the\nAnnapolis process in 2008. In December 2012, the Palestinians were granted, with a\nlarge majority, state observer status at the UN.\nON PART III: UNITED NATIONS DOCUMENTS\nON THE QUESTION OF PALESTINE\nAn accurate picture of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict must include an understanding\nof the role of the United Nations. Part III provides a comprehensive collection of\nResolutions and documents which have significantly shaped the context of this seemingly\nintractable issue.\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nThe Crooked Course\nxxxvii\nMany of the political battles related to the Arab–Israeli conflict have been fought in\nthe halls of the United Nations. On 29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly\nvoted Resolution 181, also known as the Partition Plan. It called for the creation of two\nstates—one Palestinian and one Jewish.\nOther key UN Resolutions include General Assembly Resolution 194 (1948), which\ncalls for the return of Palestinian refugees; General Assembly Resolution 303 (1949),\nwhich designates Jerusalem to be placed under UN jurisdiction; and, most famously,\nSecurity Council Resolution 242 (1967), which calls on Israel to withdraw from all\nterritory seized during the Six Day War of 1967.\nParadoxically, some of the Resolutions are seen by both parties as supporting their\nside of the argument. For example, in Resolution 242 the interpretation of the clause\ncalling for “withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent\nconflict” has been controversially ambiguous, and the object of widely different interpretations.\nThe key argument relates to whether the clause requires Israel to withdraw\nfrom all territory occupied in the 1967 war, or only from some parts of the territory\ncaptured. While many Resolutions have had hardly any effect, they nevertheless\ncontinue to be used as points of reference in the different attempts to resolve the\nconflict.\nON PART IV: REGIONAL DOCUMENTS\nThe Israeli–Palestinian issue cannot be seen in isolation: it affects and has been affected\nby broader regional dynamics and conflicts for a century. After years of colonial\ncompetition, France and the United Kingdom drew lines in the sand through the\nSykes–Picot Agreement of 1916. This agreement divided the region into spheres of\ninfluence, and eventually led to the creation of new countries. In the subsequent thirty\nyears, several programmatic initiatives were taken in the context of multiple anticolonial\ncampaigns for national self-determination and political sovereignty, including\nthe quest of the Jewish people for a national homeland.\nThe 1948 war between Arab countries and the newly founded State of Israel resulted\nin the latter significantly expanding its territory beyond that allotted to it by the UN\nPartition Plan. This marked the beginning of more than half a century of Israeli–Arab\ntensions and conflicts. Gradually the focus moved from the legitimacy of the state of\nIsrael to the country’s territorial boundaries. This coincided with broadening support,\nnot only internationally but also in Israel, for the establishment of a Palestinian state\nliving peacefully, side by side, with the state of Israel, within mutually secured borders.\nObtaining the regional buy-in to peace with Israel began with the different armistice\nagreements signed in the wake of the 1948 war. While these agreements ended the war,\nthe fighting continued to flare up as the armistice lines established were not internationally\nrecognized borders.\nThe Arab–Israeli conflict came to a new head with the Six Day War in June 1967,\nwhen Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West\nBank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. In the\naftermath, Arab nations unified their position against Israel with the Arab League\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nxxxviii\nThe Crooked Course\nResolution at the Khartoum Summit, which is referred to as the “Three Noes Document”\ndue to its clause that states: “no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no\nnegotiations with it”. On 6 October 1973, Syria and Egypt launched a war against Israel\nthat ended in a political stand-off between Israel and its Arab adversaries.\nIn November 1977, Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat broke Arab unity when he—\nin a move which stunned the world—flew to Israel and addressed the Knesset in a bid\nfor a peaceful resolution of the Arab–Israeli conflict. Subsequently, in 1978, he signed\nthe Camp David Accords that established a separate bilateral peace agreement with\nIsrael.\nCamp David highlighted the importance of a third-party broker. When President\nSadat and his counterpart, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, reached a\nstalemate, US President Jimmy Carter invited the parties to his presidential estate for\ntrilateral discussions on 5 September 1978. Three scheduled days of negotiations\nturned into thirteen days of frustrating and intense talks. Since these tripartite discussions\nwere unable to break the impasse, President Carter decided to work separately\nwith both sides. The result was an American proposal which incorporated the requirements\nof both parties into a single text. After lengthy negotiations on this document,\nPresident Carter’s shuttle diplomacy resulted in the Camp David Accords of 17\nSeptember 1978.\nIn 1993, PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat followed the precedent of President Sadat and\nbroke ranks with fellow Arab leaders by secretly and bilaterally recognizing the State of\nIsrael and signing the Oslo Accords. The year after, building on the agreements\nbetween Israel and the PLO, King Hussein of Jordan followed suit by negotiating a\nbilateral peace treaty with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. This culminated in a\nspectacular signing ceremony at the desert border crossing of Wadi Araba in August\n1994. In the agreement, Israel acknowledged Jordan’s historical role over Muslim holy\nsites in Jerusalem and agreed to recognize this role in future permanent status\nnegotiations with the Palestinians. The two leaders also agreed on steps such as the\nopening of border crossings and economic cooperation.\nIn 1999, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak defeated incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu. As has been described above, the new Prime Minister broke radically\nwith the concept of gradualism that had been the hallmark of negotiations between\nYasir Arafat and three Israeli Prime Ministers, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, and\nBenjamin Netanyahu, favoring a more comprehensive approach to the peace process.\nFor the first half of 2000, Arafat and the Palestinians were left to wait for a Syrian peace\ndeal that was not to come. Despite Barak offering Syrian President Hafez al-Assad 99\nper cent of the Golan Heights, it still fell short of Assad’s demand for a return to the 4\nJune 1967 lines, and the Syria track subsequently crumbled. This put Arafat on the\nspot: how could he now, in front of the Arab world, accept less for the Palestinians than\nAssad had demanded for the Syrians?\nThe Lebanon track fared better. It began in late 1999 with a dialogue between Prime\nMinister Barak and me, as the newly appointed UN Special Coordinator for the Middle\nEast peace process. The Prime Minister confided to me that, as a part of his comprehensive\nquest for resolving all the conflicts that Israel had with its neighbors, he wanted\nto end Israel’s occupation of Southern Lebanon that had started in 1978. Eventually, he\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nThe Crooked Course\nxxxix\nconceded that only the United Nations, and not Israel alone, could delineate on a map\nand demarcate on the ground the line of withdrawal. Such a line had to be, to the best of\nthe United Nations’ knowledge, in conformity with Lebanon’s international boundaries.\nOn this basis, and with the consent of the parties, the UN Secretary-General could\nthen report to the Security Council and eventually recommend that it should confirm\nthat Israel had ended its occupation. This understanding led to an agreement for the\nUnited Nations to negotiate with the Governments of Lebanon, Syria and Israel.\nThrough intense, difficult, and stormy tripartite negotiations over five months, the\nUN Secretary-General was in May 2000 able to report to the Security Council that the\nUN had reached an agreement with Israel, Syria, and Lebanon on a line of withdrawal\n(the so-called Blue Line). On this basis, it was determined that Israeli troops had left all\nLebanese territory. Further, he reported that, consistent with UN requirements, Israel’s\nLebanese proxy, the South Lebanese Army (SLA), had been disarmed and disbanded.\nSubsequently, the UN Security Council confirmed the end of Israel’s occupation of\nSouthern Lebanon in fulfillment of Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 of 1978.\nIn September 2004, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1559. Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan appointed me as his special envoy for its implementation. In a\nnutshell the resolution called for respect for Lebanon’s sovereignty, territorial integrity,\nand political independence; the disbanding and disarming of all Lebanese and non-\nLebanese militias; and the withdrawal of all foreign troops. After Israel’s full withdrawal\nfrom Lebanon in 2000, the only remaining foreign troops were Syrian. Immediately\nafter the resolution was adopted, I engaged in intense negotiations with President\nAssad, who until the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri on 14\nFebruary 2005, was consistently resistant to move on the issue. On 12 March 2005, I\nwas airborne with a small UN team, among them Fabrice Aidan, on my way to\nDamascus for a new round of talks with the President. Midway, the captain informed\nme that he was requested to change course and land in Aleppo. Afterwards I was told\nthat the reason was to avoid the media who were waiting for the arrival of the UN team\nin Damascus. I was picked up at Aleppo airport by Walid Muallem, who was then\nDeputy Foreign Minister. He brought me to Assad’s villa, where a few hours of\nnegotiations resulted in the Aleppo understanding, which outlined Syria’s military\nwithdrawal from Lebanon with specific timelines. Assad honored his word, and\nended twenty-nine years of Syrian military presence in Lebanon consistent with\nResolution 1559.\nWhat is often forgotten in the recurrent doom and gloom in the Middle East, is that\nthe step-by-step approach, which started with the Camp David Accords of 1978, has\nfor more than thirty years led to conflict resolution: peace between Israel and Egypt; the\nOslo Accords; the mutual recognition of Israel and the PLO; the establishment of the\nPalestinian Authority in Gaza and the West Bank, which still functions with its\npresidency, cabinet, and ministries; peace between Israel and Jordan in 1994, with\nthe recognition of borders and a long-lasting security cooperation; Israel’s withdrawal\nfrom Southern Lebanon in 2000; and the subsequent Syrian military withdrawal five\nyears later; as well as Israel’s pull out from the Gaza Strip. All these steps would have\nbeen difficult, if not impossible, without the previous ones.\nIn 2000 the attempts to put a final end to the Syrian–Israeli and the Palestinian–\nIsraeli conflicts both failed. This exposes the risks of a totalist approach to solving such\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nxl\nThe Crooked Course\nconflicts. These heroic attempts, facilitated by President Bill Clinton and his team,\ncreated a crisis of expectations, leading to the second Intifada and violent confrontation\nbetween Israelis and Palestinians, with tragic loss of life on both sides. This illustrates a\nfundamental dilemma in the choice between a gradualist and a totalist approach.\nTotalism’s “all or nothing” approach is inherently risky. When it backfires, it easily\nleads to a relapse into violence. Gradualism is less spectacular and appealing, with its\nincremental and long-term approach. However, it is precisely these characteristics\nwhich make it less risky, and more successful under some circumstances.\nWhile totalism failed in 2000, with tragic consequences, it nevertheless broke down a\nnumber of taboos, such as addressing explicitly the partition of Jerusalem and the issue\nof Palestinian refugees.\nON PART V: ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN\nDOMESTIC DOCUMENTS\nPart V seeks to provide a fuller context to the quest for peace in the Middle East. All\npolitics are local, and the Arab–Israeli conflict typifies this axiom. The ability of\nnegotiators to come to conclusions is only half the story. Documents such as the\noriginal Palestinian National Charter or Israel’s Declaration of Independence shaped\nattitudes, policies, and action on both sides.\nFurthermore, the Part includes important policy statements that signal revisions of\nprevious policies such as Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad’s vision\nfor a new Palestinian state. In August 2009, Fayyad introduced the “Program of the\nThirteenth Government” (the Fayyad Plan), which established a path to develop a\nfunctional Palestinian state within a two-year time frame. The blueprint sought to\nestablish and improve governing institutions, end Palestinian economic dependence on\nIsrael, and enhance overall infrastructure. It was a move to create a de facto Palestinian\nstate within the existing Palestinian territory, regardless of any formal recognition of\nsuch an entity. Fayyad sought proactive steps to “end the occupation, despite the\noccupation”. He stressed it was not meant as a unilateral declaration of statehood.\nIndeed, substantial developments did take place during Prime Minister Fayyad’s\ntenure. In 2011, both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund made\nstatements that the Palestinian Authority was capable of running the economy of an\nindependent state, and that it was on track to developing the necessary functions of a\nstate.\nThe Middle East peace process continues to run its crooked course. There is no quick\nfix. Yet, as this volume demonstrates, many brave attempts have been made to bring\npeace to this troubled region.\nBy compiling annotated documents related to the quest for peace in the Middle East,\na useful record and reference tool are created. Our hope is also that this volume will\ninspire future students, analysts, policy makers, and negotiators to learn from, and\ndraw on, the experiences of the past.\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\nThe Crooked Course\nxli\nAs we continue to move on the crooked path, no doubt, this compendium will have\nto be updated in the future. Hopefully, one of those additions will be a peace agreement\nthat will eventually allow us all to close the book on the protracted conflicts in the\nMiddle East.\nOslo\n13 September 2013\nTerje Rød-Larsen\nOUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 12/9/2014, SPi\nMaps\nSOFIA\nBULGARIA Varna\nGREECE Istanbul\n40º\n30º\nBlack\nSea\nSamsun\nANKARA\n40º\nTrabzon\nRUSSIA\n50º\nGEORGIA\nTBILISI\nYEREVAN\nARMENIA\nAZERBAIJAN\nBAKU\nCaspian Sea\n40º\nATHENS\n30º\nCrete\nRhodes\nMediterranean\nMatruh\nIzmir\nAntalya\nAlexandria\nSea\nCAIRO\nEl Faiyum\nAsyut\nEGYPT\nCYPRUS\nNile\nKonya\nPort Said\nTURKEY\nNICOSIA\nEl Minya\nLuxor\nAdana\nBEIRUT\nLEBANON\nHaifa\nISRAEL\nTel Aviv\nGAZA\nSuez\nTaba\nQena\nLatakia\nTripoli\nJORDAN\nRed\nSYRIA\nHoms\nTadmur\nDAMASCUS\nWEST BANK\n'AMMAN\nJERUSALEM\nAqaba\nTabuk\nSharm el Sheikh\nQuseir\nAleppo\nIRAQ\nAZERBAIJAN\nVan\nTabriz\nMosul\nTEHRAN\nKirkuk\nTigris\nBAGHDAD\nAl Hillah\nHail\nSAUDI ARABIA\nIRAN\nHamadan\nEsfahan\nAl Kut\nAhwaz\nBasra\nAbadan 30º\nKUWAIT Bushehr\nKUWAIT\nEuphrates\nArabo-Persian Gulf\nDhahran BAHRAIN\nDOHA\nQATAR\nRIYADH\n20º\n30º\nWadi Halfa\nSUDAN\nAswan\nSea\nYanbu\nJeddah\nPort Sudan\nMedina\n40º\nMecca\nMIDDLE EAST REGION\n(2014)\nTaif\nMap 1.
