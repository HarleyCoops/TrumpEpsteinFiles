    "full_text": "From: Lisa New \nSent: 9/23/2014 10:17:55 PM \nTo: Jeffrey Epstein [jeevacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: Highlight \nImportance: High \nThat was fun- definitely the highlight of a day that was not without other interesting moments \nDon't know which was better-- the wholly unexpected surprise reminder (by a prime minister) of my \nboyfriend from 1976( who was in high school, who lived with his doting parents), or , getting creamed on \nmy producer's budget but then offered the opportunity to profess poetry for production funds . There may \nbe someone as good in New York, but i'll never tell you and you really have a heck of a seminar table \nthere . when do we do Whitman's \"song of Myself\" 1-15 Who else is reading with us? I'm ready . \nA few other follow ups : \nDavid and Brigid point out that reality tv doesn't cost anything because it is, as it sounds, very low \nbudget . No writing , no special expertise or knowledge or research , no archival footage , no copyright \nclearance , no actors , no travel beyond the one location , certainly no clinton or woody allen or \njustice elena kagan or david brooks or Lena Dunham or even Professor New. That said , I think if were \nhiring the crew id do it for less -- probably 1, 250,000 all in . But I haven't won 10 Emmys and David \nhas . That has value too. As does wgbh . But I'll be more prepared for the next conversation and want to \nbe much more prepared for templeton, so thank you . \nreally liked Michael. I would like to send him some stuff , but in googling him I noticed that we have \nthe same birthday! May I have his email? \nYou are in! Yeay! Lets see what this may mean? improve my numbers and you'll improve your deep \nreading ? \nSent from my iPhone \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023426 \n"
