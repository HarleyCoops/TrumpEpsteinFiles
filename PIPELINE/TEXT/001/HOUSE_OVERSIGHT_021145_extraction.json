    "full_text": "﻿The Billionaire' s Playboy Club\nBy Virginia Roberts\nTo my true love Robbie who believes in me every step of the way and\nto all of my children, you are all my very inspirations!\nChapterl\nEvery single person in this shared world together has a unique story of\nhis or her own to tell, this one is mine.\nIt was coming up to my third night camping out at Miami Beach in the\nsummer of 1997. I was thirteen years old and hiding from a world full of\nhurt. Sitting on the shoreline for hours watching the sunset fall deeper\ninto the horizon, my eyes were glazed over with tears, not from being\nwind -whipped by the rough sea breeze, but from reflecting on the abuse 1\nencountered as a young girl and how everyone in my life who was\nsupposed to be there for me had now turned their backs on me in\nabandonment. My fears crept up and the excitement of escaping all of\nthem faded now realizing how alone I really was now, and for the hunger\nthat was paining my belly. At this point, with nowhere to go and only\ntime to waste, I wiped the tears from my eyes and set out to find an\nempathetic person that I could manage to get dinner money from. If not,\nit wouldn' t have been the first time I had gone hungry for the night. I\nwalked to the nearest bus stop and asked a handful of people for any\nspare change, none of whom that could help me. Sitting down on a\nnearby curb disappointed in grief of my current state, I put my head into\nmy knees and began to sob.\nOut of nowhere, it seemed, a black stretch limousine turned the corner\nand stopped in front of the curb where 1 had been hopelessly lost. The\nback door opened to reveal a heavy weight and balding, old man with a\nbig cheesy smile. Neatly dressed in black trousers and a collared shirt, he\nwas sitting next to a striking young, blonde girl, drop dead beautiful and\ndressed in a foxy red mini dress she looked like a model just stepping off\na runway.\nTheir smiles greeted me warmly and he kindly asked, \" What is such a\nsweet little girl like you doing sitting alone on the street looking so\nupset?\" Shocked from this strangers concern I was hesitant in telling him\nthe truth. Reluctantly I decided to tell him that I was a runaway, not from\naround here and really hungry. Hoping at most, I would get some money\nfor food from him. He instantly displayed a chilling excitement and\noffered me to come into his car so we could talk some more. That\nshould' ve been my first queue to get out of there quick but with no where\nto go, and so naive I didn' t realize how much worse it could get. Setting\nfoot into that limo, I made my first entrance into a world that would\nentrap me for many years to come.\nHe introduced himself immediately as Ron Eppinger, a businessman\nand owner of a successful modeling agency, called \" Perfect 10\".\nFlaunting his oozing wealth by introducing one of his many girlfriends,\nthe beauty next to him was Yana, a supposed model from the Czech\nRepublic who looked like she could be in her early twenties with the\nheavy load of makeup she was wearing, but really was only in her late\nteens. She kissed me on both cheeks and politely said \" Hello\" in a thick\nCzech accent, making me feel a little more at ease. Convinced it couldn' t\nbe that bad there was another girl in the car, right? I couldn' t be more\nwrong.\nWhat he didn' t tell me to begin with was that his modeling agency was\nonly posing for an undercover trade. By the time I found out 1 thought it\nwas too late to run. His business was really an illegal immigrant\ntrafficking ring of young women mostly consisting of underage girls that\nhe was using as escorts to make him Liber rich. Only available to a\nselective clientele costing them anywhere from S 1000. 00 and over per\nhour of erotic entertainment, the girls were trained to fulfill every sexual\ndesire asked of them, no matter how bizarre the requests might be. The\nhigh paid escorts, for Ron' s super rich clientele, such as Yana and many\nother charismatic beauties would only benefit a fraction of their earnings\nfor themselves, Ron reaping in the majority of the financial rewards and\nbeing they were all illegal immigrants they were further trapped by his\nenslavement.\nI proceeded to introduce myself, besides what he had found out about\nme on the curbside. Telling him my name and a little about how 1 ended\nup on the streets explaining that I could take care of myself and didn' t\nneed my family or anyone to look after me anymore. Looking back later\nin life I can now admit I was in a terrible state, but being such a\nheadstrong teenager, I refused to give in. He asked my age and I told him\nI was sixteen at first. He coyly replied, \" Are you sure? I think you could\nbe telling me a fib? How old are you... really? I wont be mad\" Being a\nterrible liar, I knew had been caught out and couldn' t deny it any further.\nI told him the truth and he chuckled then paused and answered in a very\nserious tone \" As long as you never lie to me again I will take you in\"\nRight away I pondered to myself what did he mean ... take me in?\nHe gave the driver the location of our destination and rolled the middle\nwindow back up to then tell me a story of how his daughter had passed\naway seven years ago from a horrific car accident in which four other\nteens were killed and he has never gotten over it. I reacted with sheer\nCop- ght I' - wed Mat - al\nCONIgDEN' i 1AL\nGIUF17RE004134\ng\nCopvtight Protcctcd Ma - 31 .\nCONFIDENnAL\nGIUI'FRE004I35\nAGREN BLANDO REPORTING\n31 J C I A\n\nsympathy and gave him my pity, believing this man had a heart. His next\nproposal was eerie, he said,\" If you wanted, I can be your new Daddy.\nSomeone to take care of you and you' ll be my new baby forever\" he\nstroked my hair such as a caring parent would comfort a scared child. A\npart of me wanted to accept his words and believe he really could feel\nthat way, and then I also considered how hard it was living on the streets.\nIn the end I convinced myself this would be the lesser of two evils.\nThe car stopped at a plaza on the water, surrounded by little boutique\nshops, restaurants, and little stalls with items for sale like sunglasses and\ncostume jewelry. I didn' t know what to say or do or how to act, it all\nhappened so fast I just went along with everything lie said, for now.\nWe went to a take out restaurant and ate on the waterside, and\nafterwards he took me to G. A. P Kids co. to dress me in his idea of proper\nattire, tiny cutoff shorts revealing the cusp of my buttocks and some shirts\nthat barely fit, even the sales assistant was shocked at what she thought\nwas my Grandfathers choice in clothing. I couldn' t even believe it myself\nonly an hour ago I was begging for money living on the streets and now I\nwas dining alfresco and shopping at name brand outlets. We then hit a\ncouple of more specialty stores afterwards. He said he had to buy me a\nfew more necessities to start with. Lacy G- strings and what looked to me\nlike lingerie pieces I had only seen grown women wearing in magazine\nad' s or movies was now a part of my wardrobe, in my mind it was a big\nstep up from being a little girl any longer.\nThe driver took us back to Ron' s grand apartment overlooking the isle\nof Key Biscayne and a large bridge leading into a Miami Harbor.\nEntering his residence, I was blown away by the spectacular view, rich\ndecor, and white marble floors that were so glossy it looked as if I was\nstepping on glass. He took my shopping bags to a large room at the back\nof the apartment and put them into a small closet. The room was\nconsiderably large with glass exterior walls that maximized the potential\nof the panorama landscape soaking in the seascape of Miami. In the room\nwas a gigantic round bed raised off the floor by three steps and mirrors on\nthe ceiling. It looked like a honeymoon suite out of a raunchy hotel. He\nthen exclaimed, \" This is my room here and you will be sharing it with\nme\" When I asked him where I would sleep he then sickly replied \" With\nme silly, where else of course?\" With no room for argument I pretended\nto be OX with everything that my common sense was screaming out in\nmy head to run.\nNext I was taken down a long hall at the other end of the apartment to\nmeet five more exotic beauties. Three girls were in their late teens and the\nother two in were in their early twenties. All of them were from the\nCzech, here under false passports provided by Ron and his contacts. Yana\nheld my hand while introducing me to the group of girls as \" Baby\" a pet\nname she came up with for me, being I was the youngest one among them\nor ever to be brought in by Ron for that matter. It became my new\nidentity not even worrying to mention my real name to anyone anymore.\nMy identity was no longer important to myself, I wanted to become\nsomeone new and \" Baby\" is who I was.\nA shocking first impression, the girls were completely nude revealing\ntheir voluptuous young bodies with such a careless ease and others were\nin just a G- string, similar to the one' s Ron had bought me earlier. They\nwere all stunning girls and full of life. Charismatic and beautiful, they\nwere the girls who should be on the front of billboards not selling their\nbodies to old crewed men for sex. Doing each other' s make- up in front of\nthe mirror and chatting away on the bed with no care in the world, aiming\nat persuading me to see the highlights of the life Ron gave them and they\nalmost did. Ron left the room for a few moments, letting us all get to\nknow each other a little better and that' s when I started to compile an\nunderstanding of what really went on here.\nJust catching a bit of their conversation from before my introduction, I\nheard them chatting about the night they were preparing for. Speaking\nexcitedly about some men they would be entertaining in a few hours, one\ngirl was talking about going out to sea with one o these clients on a yacht\nfor a few days. Since none of the girls seemed shy to talk about their\nprofessions or anything for that matter, I decided to ask them a few\nquestions about what they did. They were more than happy to expand on\ntheir point of view in the conversation, attempting to paint a pretty picture\nof what they were paid to do.\nThey all began to jump up and down with excitement like giddy school\ngirls at a slumber party. Another girl with jet-black hair and a thick\naccent, wearing absolutely nothing at all, grabbed me onto the bed with\nthem and into their fiasco, instantly making me feel accepted into their\nsorority, like I actually belonged somewhere for once. Yana went on to\nexplain a little more in detail, \" We accompany the wealthy friends of\nRon. They want only beautiful girls by their side so we come and act\nhowever they want us too but most importantly we make them think we\nwant them back too.\" Other girls began to jump in with their vivid points\nof view while playing with my hair, they were taking turns brushing and\nstyling it as they were filling my head with all of the prospects I could\nhave as an escort too. They made me feel beautiful like them, too\nbeautiful for what a girl beyond my years should feel. I was simply being\nlured into a dangerous trap, just like they had been at a young age too.\nIt pretty much all came down to two things in their game, the money\nthey would make and the lifestyle they were given. Their enthusiasm only\ninterested me further, making it not only sound like an acceptable way of\nliving but also appearing to keep them all vivaciously satisfied. This way\nIl Copvright ]', elected Material 11 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDLN I IAL GIUFFRE004136 CONFIDENTIAL GIUITRE004137\nof life was just mind blowing to even comprehend at first. With such a\nnew outlook of the world to try and grasp at my young age I was listening\nto every word spoken to me with such attentiveness, I was going to try\nand model what I was observing from the girls. I justified their way of\nthinking in my head for now, thinking if all these girls seem happy\nenough, why couldn' t I try to be, it was this or the streets for me.\nRon came back for me not long after our conversation got out of hand\nand took me to a bathroom down the hall. He opened the tap and filled a\nsmall plastic cup with water and handed me two small blue oval pills.\nTelling me to take them both as they would help me to relax a little bit\nmore. I swallowed the pills just following his orders. I put the cup on the\ncounter top and turned back around to face him. Backing me up against\nthe wall and now cornered by this large man I felt his slithering hands\nbegan to creep under my shirt, writhing my skin_ I closed my eyes tightly\nand turned my head away from him, hoping he would take my actions as\na sign of being extremely uncomfortable but that wouldn' t bother him at\nall. He was half enjoying my reaction from the smug look on his face,\nand persisted through it.\nContinuing to undress my clothes he said he wanted to look me over\nand clean me up. It was so humiliating having to expose myself to this\nageing man and now I knew he was going to end up with his hands and\nwhatever else all over me. All too soon I hated to be right, as I stood\nnaked before his widened eyes, he told me \" you' re a hairy bagger I' ll\nhave to shave you right up young lady\", and I didn' t know he wasn' t just\ntalking about my legs. Standing with my legs wide apart while this man\ncoaxed me through the entire ordeal of shaving, his hands made me feel\nso dirty. \" Have I lost my mind?\" I thought to myself but I had to play\nnice until I had an opportunity to get away, this was not as fun as the girls\nmade it out to be after all, this was utterly disgusting. I had no idea what\nwas going to happen next with this guy, and due to whatever\npharmaceuticals he gave me, I still don' t know to this day.\nWaking up the next morning my head was pounding in an agonizing\nthumping pain and I was so thirsty. The satin sheets thankfully covered\nmy body, which was still nude from the night before, and I could hear\nhushed voices standing over the bed where I was pretending to still be\nasleep. Listening in on their conversation I kept my eyes shut. I knew\nRon' s voice from two of the men but not recognizing the other guys I just\nstayed quiet hoping they' d soon leave. Ron was telling the other man\nwhat atrocities he got up to the night before with me and I heard him say,\nDoesn' t she even look like an angel the way she sleeps? She' s my own\nlittle angel!\" He exclaimed proudly. I opened my eyes and rolled over to\nface them both having to wrap the sheets over my body, really not\nknowing what to say except \" Good -morning\" in a blushful tone. Ron\nintroduced me to his business partner and told to go get dressed. He had\nmy whole day planned out for me already. Booked into get my hair\ncolored, a much lighter tint of blonde, and afterwards a day of shopping\nwith the girls I was becoming exactly what he wanted me too, a carbon\ncopy of the teenage Barbie... only I wasn' t plastic and came with many\nbenefits.\nDays turned into weeks, being a servant to the sexual desires of this\ndistorted pervert. I dreamt of escaping but where would I go and how\nwould I get away from Ron with him controlling my every second of my\nday. Separating myself from the other girls being so uncomfortable with\nenduring the everyday occurrences I was longing for the solitude of the\nbeach again. They were training me up to be an escort prodigy or\nsomething like it. Outrageous orgies were conducted as my lessons with\nthe girls teaching me all of their tricks in the game, it was all for the sake\nof men' s perverted fantasies, they didn' t get anything from being sexually\nexploited and molesting each other, except getting paid for it. Everything\nfrom oral sex too penetration with toys, i was expected to not only to join\nin but even perform ludicrous acts of hedonism.\n1 was Thirteen years old and had never heard the terminology of these\nsexual acts before, and definitely shouldn' t have been learning them first\nhand. Thrown into a world of chaos, 1 didn' t know what to do except be\nas compliant as possible, even when asked to do the most degrading\ntasks. The excitement of the lifestyle he offered quickly diminished once\nI had to pay so dearly for it. The girls that subdued to this lifestyle and\nenjoyed it definitely put on a good act, but no little girl with hopes and\ndreams of their untainted future, turns to her mother and say' s \" one day 1\ndream of being a prostitute, passed around from man to man, only to\ngrow older regretting so much of my life\" It was all a part of an illusion\nthat Ron painted for us that made it seem so alluring in the first place.\nSpending my days with Ron, he took advantage at every chance given.\nEven in his convertible with the top down I would be forced to go topless\nwhile he drove around, when I asked him why one day, it was supposedly\nso I could maintain an even suntan, but I knew it was his way of showing\noff his treasures. It was a far cry from the simple country life I had been\nraised in. Wearing designer miniskirts and tops that always revealed too\nmuch, of course due to Ron and the girls determining everything i wore,\nate, or spoke. We would spend our days at hair laser clinics, shopping,\ntanning beds, and eating as little as possible. Through the nights we were\nexpected to become party animals and greet Ron' s clientele with the\nupmost flirtatious attention and doting as possible. Then whether we were\nout for dinner, at a party, or at a club, the men would choose his girl and\ntake her home. Every girl had a different price and so did the charges\ndepending on the various clienteles but Ron always kept me for himself.\nCnpvright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\nCopyright Protected Material\nGIUFFRE004138 CONFIDENTIAL 0I11I' FRE004139\nI\nI would always dread the end of every night, fearing what new desires\nhe had in- store for the evening. Sometimes he would hurt me and tell me\nto try and enjoy it then do it over and over again until I gave him exactly\nwhat he wanted, I always resisted until I could no more, he was too\noverpowering and relentless at getting the results he wanted. At other\ntimes lie could be so gentle and caress my skin, worshiping every inch of\nmy body, all relying upon on what mood he was in. Often though he liked\nto play the teacher role and instruct me on every motion and explain what\nwould happen when I did those certain things to him. No matter what he\ndid to me I was only disgusted with myself more and more. I still shudder\nat the thought of how he used my body.\nI turned fourteen in August that same year and was spending my\nbirthday loaded on a concoction of pharmaceuticals and alcohol, being\ngenerously supplied by the very man who swore his devotion to caring\nfor my every need. I didn' t even know myself any longer, completely\nshying away from the girl I had grown up to be until to this point. The\napartment was empty except for me, for the time being, and that was\nGod' s own little present for me ... some solitude for once I thought.\nPouring myself another drink I opened the sliding glass doors to the \\\nbalcony and walked to the edge. Looking down from the many stories\nwhere Ron' s apartment was, I wished myself a happy birthday out loud\nand wondered if my family even remembered the day' s occurrence.\nDwelling in my sadness for the fourteen years of suffering and\nloneliness I had already endured, the tears swelled up in my eyes,\ntrickling downwards making my eyeliner inevitably leak down my\ncheeks. Inside I felt so trapped and began to entertain the thought of\njumping over the edge, it all seemed much easier, and the simple\nblackness that death had to offer rather than the tangled mess I was so\ntired of fighting to get out of seemed a much easier approach. Detached\nfrom wanting to feel anything, I became so numb towards my life' s own\ntragedies. I couldn' t live like this any longer. I lifted my bare legs over\nthe edge of the railing and sat looking at the ground beneath me so close\nto even just slipping off the edge to my very death. I couldn' t think of any\nreason not to fall. I thought I had made too many bad decisions to keep\ngoing on but some force of a higher nature had other things in store for\nme.\nThe sliding door slammed open with a burst of speed and Ron scooped\nme up in his big arms and brought me inside to our bedroom. Laying me\ndown and seeing the look of despair in my eyes from my tear stained face\nhe went into the bathroom cupboard and returned with three pink pills.\nForcing me to swallow them using the angered tone of his voice he\nthought he was turning my sorrows into a distant dream as I passed out in\nhis tight clutches, crying myself all the way to sleep. He didn' t even ask\nme what was wrong, probably because he knew already.\nSoon enough the crumbling of his evil empire in the underworld of\nselling sex for his own advantage began with a single crack in his perfect\nscheme, and proudly it all started with me. Ron got a scare one -day and\nrampaged through his apartment telling us girls to only pack our\nimportant belongings and some clothes as we all had to leave right away.\nI didn' t have much belonging to me so I basically sat there watching\neveryone rush around frantically and was curious what could' ve gotten a\nman like Ron so scarred. Once we were packed up and in the limo he was\ntrying to calm the frantic girls down after all the panic that spread through\nthe apartment like wildfire, I was the only one sitting there half amused at\nthe entire situation.\nHe began by assuring us that everything was going to be fine. Calmly\nhe continued to tell all of us packed in tightly, even for a limo, that we\nwere all taking a long trip to Florida' s countryside because someone has\nreported an anonymous tip to the missing persons unit at the local police\nstation identifying a very young girl as a possible victim of abuse living\nat his apartment. Ron knew what a landmine of trouble he had brought\nupon himself making an exhibition out of me on the streets of Miami, I\ndidn' t pull off the older look like the other girls, I actually looked\nyounger than my age with my blue eyes and freckles always giving the\nimpression of my youthful innocence.\nNow he just had to do whatever it took to ensure he stayed as far away\nfrom the authorities as possible. Arriving at a ranch in central Florida\nmany hours later and I assumed it belonged to Ron knowing never to ask\nhim things like that. I knew my purpose and it wasn' t prying into his\npersonal life outside of the bedroom. There was a main house, a few\ncottages, some staff quarters and paddocks where the horses were kept. I\nwas in heaven ... I thought at first. Finally, something I could really enjoy.\nRiding was my passion, basically growing up on the backs of horses since\nI was just able to walk.\nNot surprisingly I began to despise Ron and all of the girls for the\ngross exploits they made me do with them. Beginning to isolate myself\nfrom everyone I' d rather spend my time sitting under a tree watching the\nhorses graze, writing in my journal or painting but mostly avoiding\neveryone possible unless Ron required me elsewhere. Nighttime was\nalways a reoccurring nightmare for me. Relived over and over again in\nmany various ways. Ron would always start by making me some drinks\nand offering an assortment of pills before indulging himself by\ngrotesquely putting his genitals in my mouth and tell me how to give him\nwhat he would call a \" first-class blow -job\", and 1 was being judged every\nminute of it. Ordering me to slowdown or speedup or maintain a perfect\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDLN RAL\nOIUFFRL004140\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\nrhythm I was constantly being criticized for my efforts in pleasing him. I\nwas eager when he actually gave me a compliment. The rest of the\nevening was always a surprise left up to a moments notice. Quite\nregularly he would proceed with having the girls dress me up in some\nsexy outfit and loads of makeup then entertain him with a lesbian\nreenactment revolving him in the center. Sometimes they would use\ndildos and other foreign sex toys, Ron liked to see us hurt during sex,\nsometimes even penetrating me anally but I always resisted and would try\nto redirect him with another sexual desire of his but I had no excuses\nwhen it came to me having to use the sex toys on him, he told me how\nmen have g -spots in their rectum and instructed me on how to precisely\npenetrate him. These nights went on what seemed like an eternal sentence\nfor the price of not living on the streets, where unfortunately for the one' s\nstill there, I feared and knew from my own personal experience, could be\nmuch worse.\nNeeding some contact with someone of my adolescent mentality I\ncalled one of my school friends from the past, whom I wont name out of\nprivacy, but I' ll call him T.J. We were so close and I knew very well, so\nwell, I had memorized his number a long time before. He was my first\npuppy love sprung from of a childhood friendship. Being my very first\ncrush the summer before all of this happened he was the only person I\ncould think of that would care enough to talk to me.\nIn the middle of the day, the least busy time to be noticed, I snuck into\none of the vacant guest rooms and used the phone to call my good friend.\nThe sound of my voice radiated a chill in him. \" It' s you, oh my God\nJenna! Are you okay?\" he was so shocked to hear from me and the sheer\nfact 1 was still alive. Nearly three months now without a single word to\nmy family or friends, every one doubted my return. My attempt to forge a\nhappy voice when I spoke to him failed and I absolutely crumbled when\nhe was at a loss for kind words for me. I told him of my current state of\naffairs. Telling him of Ron and how I was terrified of him, trying to\nescape in the middle of nowhere was useless. It was like being kept in\ncage that 1 was unable to break free from. Going on to dump my issues on\nT.J, I proceeded with how I longed to call my family and to be with my\nthem for good but was too afraid they didn' t want me, knowing I' d just\nbe sent away somewhere else again and to me after all this time was like\ngoing from one cage to another.\nHe had been called by them numerously and promised me that they\nwere very worried and even hired private investigators to try and find me.\nGiven I was eleven years old the first time I was sent away, my trust in\nthere sincerity he spoke about was seriously doubted. I kept the\nconversation short just in case my absence was being noticed and I left on\nthe note that I would speak to him again shortly. His attempts to get off\nthe phone were nothing short of desperate plea to keep me on as long as\npossible. I thought he was just trying to help in someway. Giving him\nassurance in the fact I had survived this long obviously I can hold off a\nwhile longer I gave him my love and told him I' d be in touch.\nThinking I had slipped away unnoticed I entered into the room that I\nshared with Ron, hoping I got away with my brief and very needed phone\ncall. The place looked empty and everyone else seemed to be out and\nabout so I decided to have a bath in the spa and try to relax before the\nnight' s precautions. My body glided into the steamy water as 1 began to\nthink about T. J and how good it felt just to hear from a friendly voice. My\nthoughts drifted into the days I missed when 1 felt I could be silly and\nchildlike and I nearly forgot for a moment how grown up I was acting\nthese days.\nMy first glimpse at the image surrounding me when I resurfaced above\nthe water was daunting. There was Ron was standing over my tub,\nlooking down at me with an eager display of his arousal. He began to\nundo his pants and take them down when he told me \" put your lips on my\ncock\", I was too slow in responding to his request so he grabbed me by\nthe back of the head and forced me into his groin. I had tears streaming\ndown my face as I looked up to him with the saddest blue eyes hoping he\nwould take pity and stop, but he never did. I was really hurt by his\naggression and he definitely knew it this time, which I believe only made\nhim more heated. I closed my eyes and began to count using the time to\nkeep my thoughts elsewhere believing every number I counted only\nfurthered me to the end of this. I just got over a hundred when he finally\nexploded in fulfillment still half submerged in the deep bath I was\nstruggling to gain my bearings in as Ron was picked me up out of the\nbath and carried me to go to the bedroom, which was just outside the\nFrench adjoin doors. Still damp from the hot water in the spa 1 had goose\nbumps from the chill of the fresh air where he brought me to the bed and\nproceeded to deeply violate my every being. Eventually his scars that he\nleft were too deep ever to be healed and would even carry on through the\nyears to come.\nUpon his bursting with pleasure for the second time, he just got up\nand left, without even saying a word to me. Left alone I was awake for\nhours after that. There was no escaping the pain that night. I lay naked\nwrapped in the sheets, sobbing in the dark. My feelings of being hurt and\ndisgusted after his abusive ordeal \" When will it ever stop\" I prayed to\nGod and begged for death rather than face another day in my life. I woke\nup still alone the next day and exasperated from the misery I felt the night\nbefore. Ushering through my drawers to find something to throw on I\ncould care less what lay in store for me today, couldn' t be as bad as being\nraped by a scary man repeatedly.\n10\nCopvright Protected Material\n0 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENT 1AL GIUF=, 004142 CONFIDENTIAL 6'1UI LRE004143\nStarting my day with a few of the supplied oxytocin' s and a bloody\nmary, made by the live- in house chef. Having two celery sticks for my\nbreakfast, I wanted to lye out by the pool and forget the world. Ron hated\ntan -lines so to be caught with a bikini top on was a big no -no in his vile\nbook but after my cries to stop were so blatantly ignored last night, I was\nout to piss him off so I didn' t remove my shirt. I put on my headphones\nand before I knew it had fallen into a deep slumber from my self-made\ntherapeutic cocktail, the only way I knew how to cope with the emotional\nturmoil on the inside.\nDesperate to hear his voice I called my friend TJ a few more times that\nweek. I needed to feel like someone out there really knew me. Sometimes\nwe could just chat like old friends with no care in the world and laugh at\na distant memory from too long ago. Then would come the good- bye part\nof the conversation and we would both get teary- eyed not knowing what\ncould happen next or if this would even be the last time we ever spoke to\neach other again.\nMy biggest fear came to reality when I was in our bedroom one\nafternoon, just lounging around out of boredom. Ron came bursting in\nthrough the door, red as a tomato. I Couldn' t help but feeling I was in big\ntrouble. His face was distorted and raging towards me. I knew right away\nhe must have found out that I was calling TJ, but how, I had no idea. I\nhad always tried to be as invisible as possible, soon enough it was all\nexplained.\nAre you trying to get me caught? You are nothing but a stupid girl\nyou know that! What am 1 supposed to do with you now?\" He was\ntearing up the room while his rants gave me something else to think\nabout. What would he do with me if he had no use for me any longer? I\nwasn' t even thinking about him being caught for soliciting illegal\nimmigrants for the purpose of prostitution. I was more worried that he\nwould be upset at the fact I was talking to another guy, maybe even\njealous that he was at least my age. I replied with simple sentences that I\ncould manage to get out between all the shouting. I kept saying, \" I' m\nsorry\" and putting my head down in shame. He picked me up by my\nthroat pinning me against the wall, \" You are going away, far -far away\nfrom me and you better be nicer to the next man I send you to, I' ve heard\nhe' s not a nice as most would like. Are you fucking hearing me Bitch?\" I\nslid down the wall, choking on the first air entering my lungs, breathless\nand terrified, I never thought Ron was a nice guy but I had never seen\nhim lose it this bad. Now 1 was being sent me away to another stranger,\nanother man, it only terrified me more.\nThe girls came in to say their good- byes all of them were crying and\nasking me in their best English languages, why I had to call someone and\nlose everything? I was able to find out through the broken sobs off of\nthem that the confession came from the house -keeper who said she saw\nme use the room regularly but was never messed up, so Ron looked at the\nrecent telephone bills and found the same number dialed from that room\nconsecutively, he knew it was me right away. At least he didn' t know it\nwas another guy, I thought to myself, or I probably wouldn' t have made it\nout of there alive.\nRon came back to usher the girls out of my room and told me I had five\nminutes to pack my clothes, which he made clear were to be my only\nbelongings to take with me. He washed his hands clean of me that night,\nor so he thought. The driver came knocking at my door, just as Ron said,\nno longer than the five minutes that he had offered me and he took my\nsingle bag to the car. I didn' t want all the jewelry, music or books that he\nso caringly bought me as tokens of his twisted affection. Only taking my\nclothes and a wad of hundred dollar bills I had been saving, I slit a hole in\nmy scrunchie inserting my cash for a rainy day that 1 was more than sure\nwas just around the corner. .\nWe drove for hours, until I started seeing familiar surroundings. I\ncouldn' t believe my own eyes. I was back in Miami, but not on the\nbeaches, somewhere in the CBD this time. The Driver delivered me to the\nfront door with my one bag and waited at the door with me. Now I knew\nhow it felt to be a puppy picked from her litter as you can only hope your\nnext owner would treat you with some sort of kindness.\nAnother balding man answered the door but he wasn' t so grotesquely\nfat like Ron, but still a new owner at that. He looked me up and down and\nseemed amused as he snickered to himself. With one last look to the\ndriver over my shoulder it was almost an appeal to him for some way to\nhelp me. I knew he couldn' t anyways, I was just hoping. He told me his\nname was Charlie but didn' t even bother in asking me for mine. I was\nsure Ron already filled in all of my details when he arranged this.\nCharlie picked up my bag and led me into his bachelor pad townhouse.\nI was never given a welcoming tour of my new residence or made to feel\ncomfortable. He walked me up the stairs and opened one of the doors in\nthe small hallway. Telling me this would be my room, he showed me into\nit and told me to wait, he would be back shortly. I sat on my bed afraid to\ntouch anything and after the warning Ron gave me I knew I had to watch\nmy step around here. I put my head down onto the pillows my where\nworld was falling apart and let my emotions downpour. Exhausted from\nthe days emotional turmoil I ended up falling asleep. I don' t even know if\nhe ever came in at all that night.\nThe next morning I looked out of the window to see my new\nsurroundings. It was a beautiful sunny day outside, unlike the dreary cell\nI was locked away inside of. Feeling the sun warm up my face through\nthe glass, it radiated a familiar sense of comfort from the days of the good\n11\n12\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\nCopyright Protected Material\nGIUFFRE004144 CONFIDENTIAL (, It1FFRL004145\nparts of my childhood. I reminisced how it had used to be before all my\nlife turned upside down. Before all of the fights with my family, before I\nhad to look after myself, and before I was a slave to men.\nThose days were too long gone now. With too many hard times passing\nme by it seemed surreal to think that life had ever even existed in the first\nplace. With that thought I shook myself out of reminiscing that way.\nWhatever was going to happen was out of my control now, I just had to\ngive myself some hope that I would have the strength to get myself out\nthese circumstances before anything really bad happened.\nChapter 2\nThe house was quiet so I just assumed Charlie was still asleep. I\ndecided to get cleaned up and have a shower. Not even a knock on the\ndoor when Charlie walked in with ease. \" Typical\" I thought. It was an\neasy way for Charlie to break the ice. \" You really are as beautiful as Ron\nsaid\" as he opened the curtain. Watching me rinse myself in the shower\nand me knowing I had no way out of this except to go along with\nwhatever he wanted. I just looked down at the mention of Ron' s name,\nwondering what else he had told Charlie about me. Realizing later that he\nwouldn' t have said anything anyways, in fear I would' ve been a damaged\nproduct that wouldn' t make him the money that young girls go for.\nHe just sat on the side of the vanity top and continued to take\nobservations of me standing submerged under the falling water. I avoided\nlooking at him and let him do all the talking, after all I knew what I had\nto say was of no importance, that is if he was anything like Ron. Between\nthe water beating down over my head I could slightly hear him ramble on\nabout some club and restaurant he owned in FT. Lauderdale. He said he\nwas going to take me shopping for some club outfits and we would party\ntogether tonight, as if 1 was supposed to be excited over this so- called\ntreat of his.\nI looked up and gave him a quick smile adding a compliant nod and\nturned my attention to turning off the faucets and quickly grabbing my\ntowel. I was falling so far from who I used to be, shying away from my\noutgoing personality to a quiet girl that didn' t even recognize herself in\nthe mirror anymore. I dried myself off and looked at the man standing\nbetween the doorway and me. He was still watching me with a sleazy\nlook on his face but now preceded to move in my direction, arms wide\nopen. He embraced me, running his hands up around my youthful curves,\nlicking my neck and earlobes. Then his large, rough hands cupped my\nsmall breasts and continued downwards to feel in between my legs. I\nknew what I had to do to get this over and done with as quick as possible,\nbut I was dreading this moment from the second he greeted me at the\ndoor last night.\nI fell to my knees and gave into his demented perversions. Thankfully\nit didn' t last long before he climaxed and I was allowed to get myself\ndressed and ready to go out. i was nothing but money well spent in his\nmind. This was another extremely wealthy man with a completely new\nset of wants and needs asking a fourteen year old girl to affectionately\ndote on sexual desires to a man in his mid forties. I really hated myself,\nthese men, and just about everything my life had boiled up to by this\npoint, but I knew from a young age that to survive in this harsh world I\nwould have to do many things I would not willingly choose to.\nAt the shops he decided he would choose the clothes he paid for, which\nI might as well have been declared a teenage prostitute. Just like Ron he\nalso liked it that way. The more degrading he was to me only proved his\nownership of my body. He bought me tiny cocktail dresses, and skimpy\noutfits, which I thought closely, resembled the lingerie he' d also bought\nfor me to wear for him. 1 noticed that day that he enjoyed parading me\naround the shopping mall and out for lunch at hooters, even joking with\nthe waitress that he' d like to buy her uniform because lie thought it' d look\nsexy on his new girlfriend.\nWe arrived at his two in one, Restaurant and Club, at around nine\no' clock in the evening. It was a revolving tower called \" Hot Chocolates\"\nin downtown Ft. Lauderdale. The food was delicious and for the first time\nsince being with Ron, I ordered a hefty meal with steak and mashed\npotatoes with a scrumptious gravy smothered on top. Charlie ordered\nstrong cocktails for us both and before I knew it my head was spinning\nand we were on the dance floor together. The music blared in my head\nand the rhythm of my body took over, completely forgetting about even\ndancing with Charlie and letting the music take ahold and work it' s\nmagic.\nIt didn' t do me any justice though as Charlie watched me imagining\nwhat pleasures lay in store for him later on. Taking me home before the\nclub had even closed, he just couldn' t wait to indulge on exactly what he\nwas fantasizing from beforehand. Once back at his townhouse he led me\nup the stairs into his bedroom and pushed me down in the middle of his\nbed. The motions from the wavy mattress made me dizzy and feel even\ndrunker when he lay on top of me. Coming at me like a hungered beast\nwanting to ravage his next meal, it was intimidating as he entered into me\nwith a forceful thrust, he moaned out in delectable heaves. l looked away\nwhile he self indulged his own gratifying needs using my body as his\ninstrument in pleasure. I only grew stronger in my head letting the hatred\nfor men desires intensify.\n13\n14\n1) Copyright Protected Material U Copyright Protoctcd Materiel\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRL004146 CONFIDENTIAL GIUITRL004147\nThe next two weeks I was expected to be at Charlie' s beckon call, never\naloud to leave his side, even making me sleep in his bed from the second\nnight onwards. I never even got the chance to call TJ again. It was too\nmuch of a risk anyways. Thus pushing him further out of my memory,\ntoo afraid, of the emotional repercussions.\nOur typical routine was to wake up get showered and dressed and I\nwould put on my make- up while Charlie made his business calls for the\nday. We would leave the house mid-afternoon and nm his errands do\nsome shopping, sometimes meeting his friends or business partners for\nlunch, none of the men he introduced me to seemed offended at his\nchoice of adolescent eye candy. They' d just continue to chat away as if it\nwas normal to be in public with his arms draped over a girl young enough\nto be his granddaughter, not too shy by giving me a flirty tap on my\nbottom or even try to kiss me\"\nMy last night was no different from every other night. We went\nshopping that day and out for lunch alone. Later we headed to a club his\nfriend just launched and it was his grand opening that night. The club was\ncalled \" Iguana Joe' s\". We met up with his friend and said our hellos.\nThey both seemed so excited about the club and Charlie was full of\ncompliments all around. The club did have a line out the door which\nlooked a mile long coming in, luckily we didn' t have to use the front\ndoor. Charlie returned from the bar with two giant long -island iced teas,\nwhich were his favorite drink to start with and then we just sat for a while\nwatching people dancing. Occasionally conversing about passing\nthoughts. We danced for a while having a few more drinks and after\nabout two hours, Charlie said he was ready to go home. What a daunting\ntime to look forward to, he always liked to have a brief sexual encounter\nbefore drifting off to sleep with my naked body intertwined between his\narms and legs.\nIt was bad enough to have to entertain him at every given second of the\nday but his grip on me was so stifling I felt so chocked I could hardly\nbreathe much less sleep. Eventually my over-worked mind would drift in -\nand -out of a restless sleep, but constantly on edge. I thought many of\nnights of escaping, but where would I go? Would one of Ron' s ever -so -\nconnected informants finds me and turns me into him to be disposed of\nfor good? I just prayed that I wouldn' t be another missing person to add\nto the list of girls found in the local ditches. I knew that' s where I was\nheaded if I screwed this up for Ron again.\nAs if my guardian angel was there the whole time listening to my\nsecret prayers, my rescue came the next morning with an abrupt bursting\nthrough the bedroom door at about six am. Charlie and I were still lying\nin bed together and his grip on me was still tight. The men dressed in all\nblack military gear had large guns and helmets on. It was so frightening\nat first. I couldn' t even comprehend what was happening so rapidly.)\nthought Charlie could' ve been in some kind of trouble with a business\nfriend he had done wrong too, but then one of the men in black shouted\nF. B. I this is a raid get down with your hands on you head\", in too much\nshock to move three of the men grabbed Charlie and threw him to the\nfloor and cuffed him. I sat up in bed with my sheets covering my naked\nbody and watched as they dragged Charlie from the room. Still\ncompletely nude he wasn' t even aloud to get dressed. Another agent had\nto come back in to the room to find him a pair of shorts. I could hear him\nscreaming at the top of his lungs all of the way outside He was screaming\nand the last thing I heard him yell was \" If you say anything you know\nwho will find you!\" I could hear more threats being yelled at me but I\ncouldn' t make out what it was that he was saying. I was in total confusion\nand couldn' t believe what was happening. There were so many uniformed\nagents I felt so small compared to all of them but they were all very kind\nand helped me out of bed allowing me to remain covered up with the bed\nsheets so I could get dressed. The first decency I had been showed in a\nlong time. It was an odd feeling to acknowledge. I knew the life 1 had\ncome accustomed to for the last six months was now over, and in so\nmany ways I was relieved but was also very nervous about what lay\nahead of me.\nI excused myself to the bathroom to put some clothes on. Not having\nanything half decent, like a normal pair ofjeans and a t -shirt. The best 1\ncould come up with was a metallic blue miniskirt and a tiny matching top\nthat fell just below my breasts, hardly clothing at all it was more like\nscraps of cloth. Putting my hair up in a tight bun with the scrunchie that\nheld my five hundred dollar bills I was led out of Charlie' s townhouse for\nthe very last time. Starting my life over ... again, 1 wanted to leave behind\nmy every memory belonging to these horrid times. Only taking small\nsack containing my underwear, makeup bag, and journal with me.\nThe agents led me down the staircase and my last vision' s of Charlie\nwas bent over the hood of a police vehicle still screaming and\nhandcuffed\" I slipped into the backseat of the car and was driven to\nBroward County Police Station where the Federal Agents interviewed me\nabout my entire whereabouts for the last six months. I was so scared of\nwhat Ron would do if I told the agents what really happened but at the\nsame token I knew he' d most likely kill me anyways for being such a\nliability.\nOver the next few hours I sat down and told the agents how Ron' s\nbusiness worked and what I part I had to play to him. I was able to ask\nhow they found out I was at Charlie' s house and they informed me that I\nwas being followed all the way from Ocala, Florida where Ron had me\nstowed away for the last four months. TJ, my friend, called my parents\nis\n16\n1 Copyright protected Material\nCONFIDEN\"IIAL\nCopyright Protected Mawrlal\nGIUFFRE004148 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004149\nafter our first phone conversation and ever since then, the F. B. I were\ntapping the phone lines and recording every conversation. Completely\nunaware of T. J' s caring act of deceit, I was in such shock that they had\nbeen tracking us for so long. I knew now, with or without my help, the\nF. B. I had enough on Ron to put him away for a very long time, if they\ncould catch him, that is.\nHaving so many crooked people working for you can be an advantage\nwhen you' re in trouble. Like having a pair of eyes in every city. Ron was\nsomehow able to find out about Charlie' s arrest and immediately deserted\nthe country to avoid legal punishment, not to mention the discretization\nof his esteemed clientele that the feds were now on to. Ron had so many\ncountless charges put up against him, eventually when the F.B. I were\nable to track him down they were able to have him arrested in Yugoslavia\nand extradited back to Miami, he was finally held accountable for being a\npedophile, soliciting women for prostitution, and running many\nillegitimate and illegal businesses. By the time the 17, 13. 1 caught him he\nwas in his mid -seventies when he died of old age serving his second year\nprison for a lengthy sentence. Coincidentally I was told of his punishment\nand death many years later by one of the same F. B. I agents that had\nrescued me from Charlie' s arms.\nI was taken out of the interrogation room after the interview was over\nwith and told to sit at one of the officer' s desk while I was waiting for\nsomeone to pick me up. Uncertain of who that someone would be I\nassumed it would be someone from the juvenile delinquents division to\ntake me back to some state operated lockdown facility. Not the nicest of\nplaces to call home, but I had no choice in this matter.\nSitting back in the revolving chair I was twirling out of boredom and\nlistening to the roaming conversations within the office. I pondered in\nfearful anticipation of the dreadful places that lay in store for me. Having\nto of spent a lot of my adolescence in these kind of places for the sheer\nfactor that my mother said \" I was out of control and unable to handle\" by\neleven years old. There was plenty ofjust reason for me to be so scared of\nthose places. What I knew lay in store for me were constant fights\nbetween the rough girls being settled with violent raids then out came the\npepper spray and then the strip -searches and worst of all, no sunlight. It\ndidn' t matter if you were a quiet, shy girl that didn' t belong there, when\nthere was a fight, which was could be like a few times a week, every\nperson in the room was considered a threat and were treated like a violent\ncriminal. I hated those places and the memories they gave me. That' s\nwhy I always ended up back on the streets. No child or even a juvenile\nshould have to be subjected to such unreasonable force and neglect. Some\nof the girls were so used to being subdued to this kind of treatment their\nwhole life they ended up repeating the same attributes as the people who\ninitially hurt them in the first place.\nOne very sad girl I' ll never forget her, had a father who had been a\nheroine junkie and decided to play Russian Roulette with some of his\naddict friends and by fate or chance took the bullet straight through his\nbrain, killing him instantly. Her mother being a heroine addict herself\nspiraled downwards after his death and gave her four year old child to her\nageing grandmother that eventually had to put my twelve year old friend\nin this un -dire circumstance. I can only have he highest hopes for her\ntoday but unfortunately for most girls that have been victimized by\nsociety aren' t able to ever stop being a victim for the rest of their lives or\ngo on to make other people victims themselves. A sad and unfortunate\nfate for so many innocent, and it happens so much more than anyone\nwould rather admit too instead ofjust trying to find a solution.\nChapter 3\nHours later I was still twirling myself in the same office chair when I\nspun around to see my Father walking in my direction. I nearly fell off\nmy seat at the sight of him. Gripping the chairs handles 1 couldn' t\nimagine what in the world I would say to the man I once used to call\nDaddy but now hated for the abandonment and unforgiving wounds he\ninstilled inside of me. He contemplated putting his arms out to hold me\nbut instead anger and shame took over and he just shook his head. I never\nsaw my Dad cry until that day and I have to say it made me feel young\nagain and sad I had disappointed my parents again. The agents now\nstanding beside us led both of us together back into the interrogation\nroom to re -tale my journey to my father who they said I had no choice to\ntell, or they would have to tell him for me, being I was an under -aged\nminor and Ron violated the statutory rape law, among many others, when\nhe took me back to his apartment and kept me as his sex slave. My Dad\ncouldn' t believe what he was hearing and for his lack of better choice in\nwords asked me to stop talking, he was just happy to know I was alive.\nLike everyone I' d known in life they would rather brush it under the\ncarpet and not deal with the pain rather than realizing sooner or later it all\ncomes out sometime in our life even if it transgresses into our future then\nbecomes what we are willing to accept out of partners, work, and people\nin general. Simply saying in other ways than with words that our bad\ndecisions befall our tragedies later on in life.\nThe next discussion was led to where I would go to from here. Before\nanyone could put his or her suggestion forward I leapt in with my two\nbits and made it obviously clear to my Dad that if I was sent away to\n17\n18\nCopyright Protecmd Material\nCONFIDEN\"TIAL\nCopyright Protected Material\nOIUFFRE004150 CONFIDENTIAL OIUIIRhO04151\nI\nanother lockdown facility and if he betrayed my trust, again, he would\nnever see me again. I would disappear for good this time and for all he\nwould know I could be dead in no time on the streets. He looked at me\nand for the first time in my life he saw the many years I had grown up in\nthe time I was gone and heard the seriousness in the tone of my voice\nwhen I made my vow to him. He put his head in his hands and told me\nthe bad news, my Mom didn' t want me to come home and she was\nmaking his life hell for even suggesting bringing me back into their lives.\nI for some reason threatened her lifestyle and drove her crazy. I had been\nsurprised about a lot of things lately but not that one. The last time I saw\nmy Mom she ever so carefully lied to me and told me she was bringing\nme to an eye -doctor for an infection. Instead we walked into this tall blue\nbuilding with people in uniforms holding clipboards and a few muscly\nguards, she ushered me inside and hurried up to close the large auto lock\ndoors behind her leaving me there alone and imprisoned, which is what\nled me to recently living on the streets. My life was hell as long as she\nwas in control of it, so when she didn' t want me back at home I was fine\nwith that too, but there had to be somewhere else I could go. My dad said\nhe had no choice but to put me back into the facility, but he made a\nsincere promise that he would not take any longer than a week to try to\nfind a place for me to stay and to go to school. A week I could deal with,\nbut I was stili unsure if 1 could trust my father and hold him to his word,\nbut yet again, I had no choice. Being my legal guardian he could send me\nanywhere he wanted and there would be nothing I could do, except for\nkeep running. I gave in, and before he left the officers to take me back to\nthe last facility I had run from, I gave him one last hug and reminded him\none- week and I' m gone\". Nodding his head and squeezing his arms\ntighter around me, I could only hope he meant it, but he didn' t Zook too\noptimistic.\nIn the police car on the way back to the facility they had to handcuff me\nin case 1 ran again, but I had no intentions to anyways. I was going to\ngive my dad the week before I began to search for the right opportunity to\njolt again. I was like a \" ghost come back,\" said so many of my girlfriends\nfrom the past and there was now a lot of new faces there too. At night\nwhen we were all in bed and supposed to be sleeping, I would be\ndaydreaming of better days and imagine myself somewhere in a\ncomfortable bed, actually enjoying my life for a change. A week went by\nin this facility spending most of my days locked up in what they called\nThe White Room\", a bare room with concrete flooring, no toilet or even\na chair to sit on. The only comfort I had was the blue sweater that was\nprovided as part of the uniform, and my hair scrunchie fulled with my\nstowed away cash that no one had found during my unpleasant strip -\nsearches. I would spend hours in the white room for objecting to their\nconformity and unwilling to participate in their drilling regime. I didn' t\nfeel like I owed any explanation to these people even when they brought\na physiologist in to speak with me, \" What was the point when I would be\ngone any day now\" and as if any of these people even cared in the first\nplace, I was just another number in the system and they had a job to do.\nThere was one mega -bitch, female guard, named Evelyn and she used\nto either really like you or really hate you and God -forbid you were one\nof the unfortunates that she didn' t like, she' d make your entire stay their\nan agonizing nightmare. Constantly picking on girls who were not strong\nenough to cope with their predicament or past issues, she' d stand them up\nand publicly humiliate them, and even when they begged her through\ntheir sobs to let them sit down, she' d only torment them worse. Which\nonly made the strong girls want to antagonize the fragile one' s with more\nmalicious intent. Luckily when I had previously been there she didn' t\ntake much notice of me, but I stayed out of harms way with her, just\nbeing quiet and observant.\nBeing back here seemed like an eternity while I held my end of the\nbargain but unfortunately my Father didn' t. The first chance 1 saw to run\nI took it. I was being sent to go get my blood and urine taken for drug and\ndisease analysis. My driver would be a volunteer from the community\nand it was the perfect getaway for me. I was brought from the white\nsolitaire room and led into the bright sun, feeling like today would be\nfavorable in my escape. We got to the doctors office, my whereabouts\ntold me I had plenty of ways to run and I scouted out the best looking\nroute. My plan was to barge through the volunteer' s inexperienced grip\nand wriggle my way out if needed, then hit the asphalt, running until my\nlegs couldn' t carry me any further. Playing it out in my mind felt\ndifferent to the anticipation that led up to actually doing it. The inner -\nstrength I had was the only thing going to help me in this circumstance.\nWe arrived in the parking lot and I hadn' t said a word to him the entire\ndrive, the small framed Spanish man tried to make pleasant conversation\nbut I couldn' t see him as anything but a challenge, so I kept quiet instead,\nignoring his humorous attempts to befriend me. The car pulled to a stop\nand he came around the side to unlock my door, this was it, \"here we go\"\nI told myself, and pushed past the volunteer. His anus grabbed out at me\nbut only caught me by my shirt, he didn' t even put up much of a snuggle,\nlike some of the other trained one' s I had gotten before, they would put\nme into body locks of all sorts but he just tore at the collar of my shirt\nletting me break free. I had done this many times before so I knew I\nwasn' t gone yet, I had to first get out of these clothes. The cops would be\nlooking for someone of my description in the area with a blue shirt and\nkhaki pants, so my first stop was a busy shopping complex. I took the\nmoney from my scrunchie and bought myself a pair ofjeans, a shirt, and\n19\n20\nCopyright Protected Material\n0 Copyright Protected Material\nCONPIDLN' IJAL GIUFr2G004152 CONCIDGNrAL GIUI' I RLli004153\na sweater for disguise and my next stop was Dunkin Doughnuts' to get a\nchocolate iced doughnut and a cup of coffee. I didn' t have doubts about\ngetting out of the facility but I wasn' t expecting it to be so easy this time.\nMy past excursions all began with an abrupt struggle sometimes ending\nin a brutal state of affairs after being pepper sprayed and fastened into\nsome painful lock by forceful men four- times my size, then tossed into\nsolitary until I saw my next chance to desert. I got to know the guards\nreal well, as I spent a lot of my time being dragged down to the white\nroom by them. There was Jim, a large black man who could' ve doubled\nfor a \" Miami Dolphin' s\" defensive linebacker. John was another big man\nwith a ponytail and a mustache, and he looked like someone who\ndefinitely owned a Harley. The last guy Scott had a smaller build but\nmade up for it with his steroid injected muscles bulging out of his neck\nand their was the added height from his curly fro. When they weren' t\nrestraining me and holding me captive in solitaire, they were actually\npretty nice guys, not afraid to have a laugh after some explosive incident\nand I held no contempt towards them either, they were just doing their\njobs.\nIt was de' ja' vous all over again, free at last but where would I go now.\nWith Ron' s scouts on the lookout for me, and now the authorities being\nnotified I was a runaway again, I would have a lot of people searching for\nme, so I knew I had to be careful where I went. My last stop before\nleaving the shopping center was to use a payphone to call my parents, my\nDad answered completely surprised to hear me on the other end, I wanted\nto sarcastically thank him for breaking his promise to me and I hope he is\nhappy now, he just lost his daughter for good. I stopped to listen to what\nhe was trying to say and he told me \" I was getting you out in a few days,\nI found you somebody to stay with, she' s a good person who has got\nteenagers your age, I was just trying to convince your Mother to sign the\npapers to get you out of there\".\nI was so outraged at her ability to put her own wants before the needs\nof her own flesh and blood daughter. I told him to come pick me up and\nbring me to the house so I could speak with her for the first time in over a\nyear, but if I felt threatened for one second I will be on my way quicker\nthan a blink of an eye and on my own for good. He wasn' t overjoyed at\nmy proposition, knowing what position this put him in as her husband but\nas my father he decided to put me first for once and take me home to\nconfront my mother.\nI arrived at my house for the first time in a long time and everything\nlooked different. My parents refurnished and renovated the house. l didn' t\neven have a room anymore, my old belongings and bed were removed\nand it was now the office. Of course my Mom didn' t meet me at the gate\nor the front door like her long lost offspring reunited. No, instead she\nwaited for me to come find her outback smoking cigarettes and having a\nbeer. She stood up from her seat and squinted her eyes loathing in her\nhatred she coldly slapped me hard in the face. The slap stung, but I\nmatched her look with a familiar stone -coldness that only she could\nunderstand. Immediately we both started to cry and we washed away our\nanguish and resentment through our tears and consolidated our feelings\nfor the first time since the chaos first affected our lives. She didn' t want\nto know much of my whereabouts and she still had a lot of anger to get\nover but she asked me to stay home at least. My little brother ran through\nthe back door and hugged me so tight, I started to cry again and was\nsaddened by how much time 1 had missed the time I had lost just hanging\nout with my brothers and it took me even longer to realize how precious\ntime really is. We were never going to be the average Joes next door but\nat least this was better than nothing. I loved being with my family again.\nWe had BBQ' s and bon -fires with each other and life began to slowly\npiece back together. It was bizarre how normal it was when I first got\nhome. I turned fifteen that year and it was the exact cup of tea that 1 had\nneeded to boost me up and get me on the right track.\nI decided to go school to acquire my general education diploma or G. E. D\nand got a summer job with my Dad at Mar-A- Lago, Donald Trumps\nexclusive country club in Palm Beach. Surrounded by lush acres of\ntropical landscapes, manicured gardens, and a mansion made into a beach\nclub for the rich and famous it is known as the \" Jewel of Palm Beach\". I\nwas in sheer awe at the gold arched ceilings and the grandeur ballrooms.\nThe spa where I worked was world class, not only oozing in style but in\nthe way each and every clientele was treated with the upmost service. My\nfocus was now set on becoming a massage therapist, and working my\nway into a luxurious spa like the one I worked for now, only I was a\nlocker -room attendant there. I studied many books about the anatomy of\nthe human body and how you can affect a person' s well- being and health\nfor the better through a simple healing touch. It was amazing to me the\nway the body responded to massage. I was more than just interested. I\nwas determined to become a therapist.\nIt was one of those anatomy books that i had my nose buried in one\nafternoon on a quiet Tuesday and it could get pretty lonely in the locker\nroom, so if I weren' t busy I' d sit outside by the spa' s reception and read\nmy books in the warmth of the Florida sun_ A lovely looking woman in\nher late thirties who spoke with a proper English accent approached me. 1\nassumed it was a general question, \" like where' s the ladies room or was\nthat the famous model from so- and- so?\" but she was more interested in\nthe book 1 was reading. Only believing at first we were just making small\ntalk she was really intrigued at my choice of reading. She then asked if I\n21\n22\nCI Copyright Protected Material J Copynsht Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE,004154 CONFIDENTIAL OIUF1 RE004155\nI\ndid massage on the side, 1 stated I was only reading the book and had not\nyet began to study but one day I would love to practice massage therapy.\nShe introduced herself as Ghislane Maxwell. I would later find out that\nshe was the daughter of the late prominent businessman and disgraced\nnewspaper tycoon, Robert Maxwell. I told her my name is Jenna pointing\nto my nametag on my shirt and offered her a cold or hot beverage, as\nthose were my instructed duties at work. She accepted a tea and went on\nto chat a bit about this rich guy that she worked for and she knew offhand\nthat he was looking for a massage therapist. Just doing me a good\ndeed out of her kindness of her heart, I' m sure, she offered to introduce\nme to him. I declined her first proposition, thinking out loud, told her I\ndidn' t know the body well enough to even attempt an interview. She\ndidn' t seem worried at all by my fear of incompetence saying that if he\nliked me enough he would get me the best training in the industry.\nGhislane thought I had a cheery persona and fit the quota for what he was\nlooking for and as she put it an enthusiastic learner that she said she\ngathered from the sticky notes popping out of the various sections in my\nbook. I accepted her phone number and the house address and told her I\nwill call her if I am able to come over after work. I rushed over to the\ntennis courts where my dad was working and told him of the news. We\nboth thought this could be a wonderful opportunity to get my\naccreditation in massage therapy. Seeing that it was a lady in her late\nthirties who came off as more of a nurturer rather than a procurer, neither\nof us saw any reason to be hesitant.\nChapter 4\nAt around Five p. m. my dad drove me down to the bottom of \"El Brillo\nWay.\" on the Palm Beach intercostal. We pulled into a short driveway\nbeckoning a large pink mansion with heavy wooden doors. I was so\nexcited about this chance and asked my dad to wish me luck. He gave me\na big squeeze and wished me the best. He walked Ire to the front door\nand I rung the door chime. Moments later we were greeted by an older\ngentleman dressed in a casual butler uniform. I told him I was here to\nmeet Ms. Maxwell for a massage trial and he opened the doors for my\nfather and I telling us to wait in the entry as Ms. Maxwell would be on\nher way any second, and she was_ Down the stairs she walked with a\nwarm smile, her short black hair seeming very proper and elegant, for\nnow. She shook my fathers hand and thanked him for bringing me and\nkissed us both on the cheeks_ They spoke briefly about whom she worked\nfor and about Mar- a- Lago where we worked. She was in hurry, you could\ntell to end the conversation and say good-bye to my dad, which she did so\never pleasantly. She said the boss was upstairs and waiting my arrival, so\nwith that I said bye to my dad and began to follow Ghislane up the stairs.\nI was so nervous, but I didn' t show it. I kept my reserve and demeanor\ncool as ice, trying show maturity for the open position. We continued on\nto the massage room, passing by a grand crystal chandelier, and a couple\nlengthy wooden hall tables displaying a multitude of photos displaying\nyoung girls and beautiful women, trying not to gawk at them I didn' t\neven notice that some of those girls were only wearing their smile.\nGhislane asked me how my day at work was and 1 told her it was easy\npeasy as always just trying to make simple conversation. There was a\nfork at the end of the staircase and she led me to the right hand side. The\nlights were dimmed in the bedroom but I could still see the King Size bed\nin the middle of room, we did a U- turn around the bed, which led us into\na massage room. Dripping in luxury I could' ve definitely compared it to\nthe renowned Mar- a- Lago' s spa' s, it had marble walls and a glass\nenclosed shower and self -automated steam room at the very end of the\nBurberry carpeted room. There was a large mirror over a basin to the\nright of the room with an array of oils, ointments, soaps, and lotions and a\nsmall closed door, which I assumed must be a closet. The only thing that\nstruck awkward about this room was the naked man laying face down\natop of the turquoise massage table in the center of it. \" I had to be\nprepared for this,\" I told myself. Massage was something 1 had never\ndone before so 1 quickly brushed away my thoughts of possible schemes,\nwanting to believe whole -hearted this was going to be legit. Ghislane\nintroduced us to each other and I proceeded to make his acquaintance.\nLooking up at from his downwards position, he looked me over and\ngave a smile to Ghislane, an obvious notion of his approval. He was\nJeffrey Epstein as she pronounced for him, as if I supposed to recognize\nhis name or something. He affirmed, \" It was his pleasure\" and replied to\njust call him Jeffrey, \" No need for formalities\" he answered, cleverly\nputting me at ease. This man did not look like someone to beware of.\nBoth him and Ghislane appeared to be very nice people and conscious of\ntheir health as their need for massages and spa visits, no alarm bells went\noff, yet. I was prepped by Ghislane to \" treat this as a lesson from her and\nfollow her exact lead, if I did good tonight then maybe I would become\nJeffrey' s Travelling Masseuse, seeing the world and getting paid well for\nit\". I was very hopeful, a job like this could really make my dreams come\ntrue.\nI followed suit and washed my hands with warm water so the coldness\nwould not shock Jeffery' s naked body, then lathered them in rich body\nbutter. Ghislane told me to always keep one hand on Jeffrey, even when\ngetting more lotion, so it didn' t make him lose concentration on being\nrelaxed. She gave me a tip and told me to keep a blob of lotion high up on\n23\n24\nCopyright protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\nCopyright protected Material\nGIUFFRE004156 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFI RL'004157\nmy forearm so it prevented me from having to keep going back for more\nand was less disruptive to Jeffrey. This all seemed for real to begin with, I\nwas being educated about the body and splitting Jeffrey' s body with\nGhislane, mimicking her every motion. Starting with his feet, we began\nwith his heels and arches of his soles. Pushing the blood up his calves in\nupward strokes to rejuvenate the body' s blood supply and being careful to\nmind his leg hair didn' t pull. I was keeping up with her and enjoying the\neducation. It was so interesting how the body worked and I couldn' t\nbelieve i was learning all of this for free. Once 1 got a bit of a groove\nfollowing Ghislane, they began asking me all sorts of questions about my\npast and it didn' t take long before the conversation led down the darker\nexperiences of my young life. When they found out that I hadn' t led\nmuch of a normal existence they only probed me with more questions,\nwhich being put on the spot answered honestly. The funny thing was they\ndidn' t seem appalled at all by my statements, rather entertained if\nanything. Jeffrey called me a \" naughty -girl\" with that wry smile of his,\nand half playful and half defensive, 1 answered \" no I' m not, I' m really a\ngood girl, just always in the wrong places\" he then replied, \" It' s O.K, I\nlike naughty girls\" and rolled over onto his front side to expose his\ncomplete nude self. He wasn' t the first man to show me his penis, so I\nwasn' t shocked at the appearance of his manhood but I was incredibly\nshocked at his complete ease to present himself with an erection. I tried to\nignore it waiting to follow the next directions off of Ghislane, who\nsurprisingly now stood behind me bare breasted. Before I had a chance to\neven think of replying hastily she began to slowly undress me, while\nJeffrey started to stroke his manhood white watching us. She unbuttoned\nmy blouse and removed my bra, revealing my bosoms. Cupping them in\nher hands she moved her lips across my nipples, licking and teasing them\nwith her tongue making them cold and stiff. Next her hands moved down\nto my little white skirt, removing the final piece of my remaining\nuniform. She slid my skirt down my legs with ease, for a moment keeping\non my love -heart panties, so they could both take notice of my apparent\nyouth. They even snickered to each other about \" How cute she still wears\nlittle girl pantie' s\" Jeffrey said, and Ghislane joined in his laughter.\nActing as my madam, she instructed me to start by licking his nipples\nand after I had sufficiently pleasured both of them, then prompted me to\ngo down on Jeffery orally while she rubbed her breasts along his body\ntantalizingly. She moved behind me again this time to remove my panties\nand start fondling the delicate folds between my legs. I was still in shock\nfrom the initial degrading blow. I hadn' t even let the reality sink in, it was\nall too much for me to emotionally handle so instead 1 hid behind my\nfears, which I told myself \" I wasn' t going to ever be worth anything at all\nand this would probably be as good as it gets for me\" after all I thought,\nwhat have I been trained up for until now\". Nobody ever stopped to ask\nif I was comfortable or if I wanted to stop, no, instead, Ghislane only\ndirected me to conclude the massage session by climbing up on the table\nto be fixated on Jeffrey, straddling him so he could penetrate me.\nWhen it was all done and over with, I was taken into the steam room\nwith just Jeffrey to get further aquatinted, as Ghislane left the room to go\nget dressed. He asked me to grab his feet and nib them not saying a word\nabout what just happened, like it was all normal and accepted. I listened\nto him ramble on about the health benefits of a sauna and the history of it,\nignoring the fact of the matter of his pretentiousness degrading my spirit.\nI figured 1 had gone too far already, what would be the point in throwing\nin the towel now after I had done exactly what these people wanted.\nWhilst we were sweating out our bodies' toxins, and the steam was\nblasting my burning face I listened to his lessons, entertaining his ego, I\nlet him become my teacher, he seemed to like that. He sounded like a\nvery clever and intelligent man though. Telling me his story of how he\nmade himself an empire of billions from being a middle- class professor to\nan elite financial advisor for clientele with only billions in their bank\naccounts and through his so- called `lessons\", He became my mentor and\nI emerged as his pupil, the teacher' s pet.\nAfter the sauna we went to the next glass door beside us where the\nshower was. He turned tap outwards and stood underneath the water as I\nstood naked and cold from the temperature difference. Instead of asking\nme to join him under the warm stream, like i thought he was going to, he\nhanded me a bar of soap and asked me to wash his body from top to toe.\nIt didn' t stop there I had to massage the shampoo and conditioner into his\nscalp as well. I was bewildered someone would ask this off of someone\nelse, wasn' t it belittling enough having to endure the illicit massage from\nbeforehand but now this. The surprises kept coming that night, as this\nwas definitely not how I expected my interview to turn out, but that' s\nwhat I had learned in my short time on this earth, life was full of\ndisappointment.\nI let everyone else take the power of authority from myself and use me\nin whatever way he or she wanted instead of standing up and giving\nmyself the respect I deserved, which in turn would' ve helped me get\nthrough life without all of the abuse I ended up copping. Not given the\nbelief in myself from an early age on I suppose is what affected my sense\nof control. Always letting the one' s with power and strength reduce my\ninner -self to shreds until I was cut so tiny in size I would be completely\nsubdued to only their wants and needs left ignoring mine. The men I had\nencountered in my short experience with them only repeated their\ninflictions convincing me there was no running away from the sick world\nI lived in, not yet understanding it all came down to the choices 1 had\n25\n26\nCopyright Protected Maw rio1\nCONFIDENnAL\nCopyright Protected Material\nGILIFFRE004158 CONFIDENTIAL G1UFFRL004 Lig\nmade for myself, I needed some encouragement and the right words to\nunlock my very soul.\nJeffrey told me the towels were on the heated rack just outside the\nshower and asked me to get one and pat him down. Again putting himself\nfirst as I sat there freezing while I compliantly patted down his body with\nthe white fluffy towel until he was dried. I nearly expected him to ask me\nto dress him as well, but not surprisingly that came later down the track\ntoo. I dried myself off and wiped the make-up from under my eye' s,\nkeeping quiet not sure what to really say and half -embarrassed from the\nentire evening' s events that just took place. I just remained silent whilst\nwe both got dressed until he brought me downstairs where Ghislane was\nsitting at a desk holding his black leather duffel bag. When she moved\nfrom the chair to let Jeffrey sit down, she passed him the bag and began\nto tell me that I had great potential to be a massage therapist, they really\nliked my style and who knows where this could lead too. She asked to see\nme again tomorrow, same time after work. He opened the bag, revealing\nstacks of brand-new hundred dollar bills separated with rubber bands to\ncount by the thousands. He grabbed one stack and took out two crisp\nnotes, placing them in my hand. He laughed that it was nearly my whole\nweek' s wage at Mar-A- Lago. Only there I didn' t have to degrade myself\nas his new little toy.\nWhen 1 got home my parents were anticipating my arrival. I kept it\nsimple and sweet with my folk' s, only telling them of the lessons about\nthe body I had received and the future prospects in massage therapy that\nlie ahead. Nobody questioned who I was working for and complimented\nmy ability to be a hard worker. I quickly got out of that conversation\nafraid I might give away a hint of shame in my eyes but no one caught\non. I excused myself to the bathroom to have a shower and stared into the\nmirror for a moment, asking myself if I could really go through with this\nonly to mentally respond by reminding myself this would be as good as it\ngets for a girl of my stature and limitations. I scrubbed myself rigidly in\nthe shower as if it would wash away the filthiness of the night, but it\ndidn' t help, I could still feel their hands in me and all over me and inside\nof me. Trying to sleep that night was nearly impossible too, closing my\neyes only to drift away to flashbacks of the moments I had to give myself\nto Jeffrey and Ghislane, each replay an exploitation of my vulnerability.\nThe next morning I awoke feeling anxious about the day ahead, trying to\npush yesterday' s memory from my thoughts, I was quiet for the whole\ntrip to work with my Dad. Before we got out of his car in the parking lot\nhe asked me if everything was okay, I lied, for his sake and mine. My life\nwas being transformed and I didn' t even know it yet, but soon enough I\nwould be a brainwashed tool only used for the sexual pleasure of others.\nAbout to be entrapped in the same life I had broken free from only\nmonths ago.\nConvincing myself in order to succeed I had to step up from being a\ngirly teenager and start thinking like a young woman, it would be my\nticket to a great career and a fortunate life. I told myself \"So what if I had\nto bargain my body to this rich old geezer, some girls get themselves\nthrough college by becoming a stripper and using their bodies to pay for\ndegrees, others go down even worse paths.\" I guess it was just another\nway to fathom the road 1 was going down, the effectiveness of the lies I\nforced myself to believe was working as I continued to tell myself I had\nto make it any way I could rather than ever letting myself sleep on the\nstreets again. I was trading one shocking lifestyle for another, thinking I\nwas choosing the right one. If I could go back in time to ever meet myself\nI would choose this time in my life. I' d start with a good hard smack to\nmy head to first shake some things up in there and next I would tell that\ngirl she could actually make it on her own if she jList worked hard at\nearning an honest wage and built her life up slowly. There is no rush or\ntime limit to ever stop reaching for achievement. Sadly enough I probably\nwouldn' t of even believed myself anyways, learning my life' s hard\nlessons through the experiences I continued to suffer.\nI went to work at Mar -A Lago that day trying hard not to think of what\nlay ahead in the afternoon too come, but the later the hour got the more\ndistinguished the knots became in my stomach. I spoke to no one of the\ndetails to my explicit interview but told one girl how I was so happy I\nwas now officially studying massage therapy, another lie. My friend was\nsurprised and intrigued that these people who could afford the best of the\nbest of therapists in the world chose an untrained fifteen -year- old girl to\nperform a massage. She never said it in words, but her body language told\nme she knew exactly why they wanted to use me and it wasn' t for a\ntherapeutic reason either and deep down inside I understood.\nThe rest of the afternoon slipped away quickly and before I knew it I\nwas standing before those large wooden doors again, giving a moments\npause but long enough to draw in my breath and exhale some of the\nanxiety before ringing the doorbell. Juan answered the door again and\ntold me Ghislane would be down in a few moments and asked to follow\nhim into the kitchen. There was a pleasant looking young girl with blonde\nspirals in her hair that glanced up from the mound of paperwork before\nher. Her shocking blue eye' s and appealing English accent seemed\ndelightful and she introduced herself as \" Emmy\", Ghislane' s Personal\nAssistant. I introduced myself as \" Jenna\" which is what most people\nknew me as and told her I was on an employment trial to become\nJeffrey' s massage therapist. She had a coy smile on her face that told me\nshe knew exactly what I was on trial for. Something in my gut told me\n27\n28\nf I Copyright Protemd Matcdal Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004160 CONFIDENTIAL GIUrFRE004161\nthis wasn' t the first time a young girl had been trialed for the same\nposition I was about to fill.\nWe were only chatting for a moment before Ghislane appeared and told\nme Jeffrey was ready for his massage. I was led through the extensively\nlarge house to the winding staircase that would lead me up to the same\ndreaded room where I would have to re-enact last night' s performance. I\nwasn' t far from wrong. I gave Jeffrey a massage with Ghislane leading\nthe way again, this time we surprisingly made it to the front of his body\nand she continued to show me how to massage all the way up to his\nstomach pushing my hands in a spiraling clockwise circular motion to not\ndisrupt the bowels and then we came up to his chest. He couldn' t dare\ncontain himself for one second longer, telling me to put my lips on his\nnipples and give them a kiss. Jeffrey moaned in pleasure and Ghislane\nstarted to undress me from behind. Within moments I was completely\nnaked and Ghislane had her top off. She was caressing my body with her\nhands while Jeffrey moved his hands down to stroke his loins while he\nwatched her and I kiss and touch each other. I didn' t know if she was\ndoing this for the sake of his eye -candy but she sure did act like she loved\nhaving the control over me telling me what to do throughout the entire\nthreesome. Jeffrey' s climax was always the end to our sessions and this\ntime he wanted to have me make him orgasm orally. Afterwards we went\nfor the ritualistic steam -room, this time Ghislane joining in with us for\nconversation. She asked me to massage her feet this time while we were\nin the steam room, showing me that Jeffrey wasn' t the only one I had pay\nmy homage to. We all had a shower next and then we all went downstairs\nto pay me and have Juan drop me offback home.\nThe following afternoon I received a call at work, surprisingly it was\nGhislane asking me to come over when I got off of work again. The\ncompliant side took over and 1 told her I looked forward to meeting with\nthem today, instead of telling her to go screw herself for lying to me and\nmaking me degrade myself more each time I saw them. I finished work\nfor the day and my Dad brought me over to El Brillo Way again, where\nthe vultures were patiently waiting in their lair, he wished me well as 1\nhopped out of his big truck, looking ever so much like his little girl again.\nI gave him a smile and a wave as he drove down the long driveway,\nwaiting for him to suddenly turn back and not leave me alone to my task.\nI shook myself out of that calamity and put on my \" big girls\" face.\nJuan brought me to the kitchen again as I waited for Ghislane. He\noffered me a cold drink and some fruit on a platter, I accepted and was\ngrateful for the rejuvenation before I went to work again. It wasn' t long\nbefore Ghislane approached me from behind with a cold intense look in\nher eye. I jumped from my seat, feeling like maybe I shouldn' t have been\neating and drinking while on the job, as her demeanor seemed annoyed\nand temperamental in the seconds that she appeared. She told me I would\nbe on my own today as she had business to attend to, so make sure 1\nremembered what she had taught me, as my trial depended on it.\nChapter 5\nI walked up the stairs by myself this time, taking in more of the decor,\nnoticing the more I looked around the more I noticed a different girl in\neach photograph in his collection of half -nude and topless girls on display\naround his mansion. I couldn' t believe how many girls there were, it' s not\nlike Jeffrey was much to look at. He was an aging man in his early fifties\nwith shiny grey hair and characteristic lines drawn down his face as if he\nhad seen harder days. With no prospects of ever settling down or having a\nfamily of his own, Jeffrey treated us girls like apiece of clothing he could\ntry on for the day and get rid of the next. So why was there so many girls\nin these photo' s? I wondered to myself if I would end up one of those\ngirls among his collection of forgotten relationships and broken promises.\nI continued to make my way up the stairs, and as if all of my senses\nwere heightened from my bare nerves being exposed, l could smell the\ncleaning detergents recently used by the housekeepers, my observations\nof the shade of lighting through the concealed blinds as 1 entered Jeffrey' s\nbedroom appeared golden, and the sound of stillness except for the thud\nof my rapid beating heart all made me more aware of how nervous I was\nto be on my own. Not that Ghislane was anything of a comfort, but I\ndidn' t know what to expect or how I was going to lead myself into\nupholding my obligation in pleasing him. I would hope for the best I\nthought, trying to uplift my confidence as I opened the door to the\nmassage room with the typical scene of Jeffrey laying naked facedown in\nthe massage bed waiting for his entertainment. It was de' ja' vous' all over\nagain. Repeating what Ghislane had taught me, with him commenting on\nwhat else I should be doing, until it got to the end and I was expected to\ngrant him all of his spoken desires. We finished up with the shower again\nand he seemed very pleased in my contribution of myself to him, giving\nin to every request.\nHe told me to go ask Juan to pay me, as he was lethargic after the\nmassage and intimate affair between us and now was going to have sleep.\nI walked back down stairs and told Juan that Jeffrey was asleep and said I\nhad to ask him for my pay. He went to Jeffrey' s desk and took out the\nexact amount I was owed without even asking how much I normally get\npaid. He then drove me home, only to be back the next afternoon.\n29\n30\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\nCopyright Protected Material\nGIUFFRE004162 CONFIDENTIAL GIUl:lUhO04163\nThe following week was a daily routine, providing Jeffrey with\nmassages and continuously being groomed to fulfill all his needs. Often\njoined by Ms. Maxwell and her assistant Emmy for sexual trysts of all\nkinds. I was mentally and physically exhausted from the week of working\nand having to keep up with Jeffrey' s strenuous late night activities. I\ncouldn' t believe what I was doing but it was all starting to sink in fast.\nMost nights when I got home, I' d briefly say \" Hi\" to Mom and Dad\nbefore heading straight to my bedroom. I couldn' t even sleep well\nanymore. Closing my eyes at night I would fight the inevitable flood of\nthoughts, replaying the moments of shame that ate away myself piece by\npiece. My only reasoning being I just had to keep telling myself it would\nall be worth it in the end.\nThis afternoon Ghislane appeared to be in a much better mood. Instead\nof taking me straight up to Jeffrey she took me to a yellow guest room\nwhere Emmy mostly stayed. It had a balcony where Emmy was already\noutside reading a magazine and puffing on a cigarette. Ghislane lit one up\ntoo and then offered me one. I hadn' t smoked cigarettes much before,\nbesides trying to look cool in front of one of my friends, but never really\ntook to them, so when I started to cough from the inhalation of smoke,\nthe girls began to laugh and joke about my in -experience. It was an\nicebreaker for all of us to laugh and poke fun at me. I was then able to\ngive it back to them saying I would rather be an in -experienced nonsmoker\nthan an old lady with a raspy smokers cough. I don' t think\nGhislane was used to somebody giving it back to her, but she seemed to\nlike it, as long as she was able to have the last say. I knew my boundaries\nand she liked that I wouldn' t cross those invisible lines. All three of us\nchatted like friends and it started to feel like some kind of a strange\nrelationship was budding. After about fifteen minutes of chatting away,\nGhislane instructed me to wash my hands thoroughly, as Jeffrey hated the\nsmell of smokers, and to follow her down the hallway to the massage\nroom where he' ll be expecting me shortly. I did what she asked and\nsprayed myself with the body spray that I always carried in my purse and\nheaded down the hall to Jeffrey' s room.\nWhen I opened the door to the massage room surprisingly it was empty.\nI sat down on the already made up massage table and was careful not to\nmess up the neatly folded towels on the end of the bed. It was a good\nfifteen more minutes before Jeffrey made his appearance. It was strange\nseeing him in clothes for the first time. He wasn' t wearing what you' d\nexpect your typical billionaire' s attire to be. He was wearing a pair of\nsweatpants and a Harvard sweatshirt, which he began to remove\nimmediately. This time he wanted to commence our session in the steam\nroom, so I began to undress as well. We went into the steam room and he\npushed a few buttons and the steam began to pour in from the marble\nwall' s built in jets. There was a bench coming out of the wall also made\nout of marble that went from either side of the room and had a step\nunderneath it where I was instructed to sit on so that I could begin giving\nJeffery his massage. Our conversation started off about simple things like\nhow was your day at work, and I asked Jeffrey how his day was lounging\naround, just being polite to each other. He was acting out of character\nbeing a lot more attentive and conversing with me about other things than\nsex or massages for once. Starting with his heels, ankles, toes and arches\nin the soles of his feet 1 massaged all the way up to his calves. It took a\nlot more strength to massage in the steam room without oils or lotions\nand the constant blowing of steam in your face making me twice as\nexerted. I was beginning to really start to heat up when the door to the\nroom suddenly opened to reveal two naked women. Ghislane and Emmy\nacted as if they came in to join us for a steam bath, but my instincts were\ntelling me otherwise. At least the cold burst of air and escaped steam\nrevived me a bit.\nSo there was Jeffrey and Ghislane sitting on top of this marble bench,\neach with a young girl at their feet. Emmy and I continued with the\nmassage until they were ready to head into the shower. There were two\nshowerheads that Ghislane and Jeffrey both stood under while they were\nbeing lathered with soap bubbles as we washed their bodies. After the\nshower Ghislane led us into Jeffrey' s bed to finish today' s session with\nEmmy, Ghislane and I performing lesbian acts of foreplay on each other\nwhile Jeffrey laid back and watched. Stroking his manhood in much\ndelight, he brought himself to climax, and the session was over within\nmoments. We all got dressed and went downstairs to the kitchen for some\nrefreshments. Like nothing had happened at all, it was all so bizarre for\nme, the whole ordeal with them since this all began. I couldn' t understand\nwhy Ghislane and Jeffrey had such an openly intimate relationship but\nyet never regarded themselves as partners. They rarely kissed and never\nheld hands or even slept in the same bed. It was more like a sexual\narrangement between the two of them. She brings in the girls for his\npeculiar taste and he supplies the lavish lifestyle she was accustomed too\nbefore her family lost all of their fortunes. I wasn' t sure how to act or\nfeel, always obliging to their needs but reserved enough not to get\nattached, as if there was this invisible hierarchy and by instinct I knew\nmy place.\nWe all hung out in the kitchen for a while before I asked when Juan\ncould bring me home as I had work in the morning and was tired. They\nsaid no problem and called Juan on the intercom right away, but said\nwe' d all have something to talk about tomorrow. I knew it had something\nto do with my employment trial and from the way they were acting\ntonight, I could only assume I got the job, but you never know with these\n31\n32\nl I Copyright Protected Material\nU Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GILTFFRE004164 CONFIDLN'rIAL GIUII' RL00416,\ntypes of people. Their friendships and partnerships can change like the\nweather.\nI went home that night still confused on how I could let myself sink so\nlow, I had to put on an act like I enjoyed submitting my body and being\ntheir new subservient plaything all for the fact that I was making\nanywhere between $ 2004400 for just a couple of hours. Then spent the\nrest of the night regressing on the entire event in my head over and over\nagain. I battled those thoughts with the hope that I was receiving a\nprofession out of this and making good money in the meantime. All I had\nto do was keep lying to myself long enough until I eventually believed it.\nArriving at Jeffrey' s on time the next afternoon, as I always did,\nunderstanding punctuality was a sign of respect and I wanted them to feel\nas if they had my deepest appreciation for the once in a lifetime chance\nthey had given to a girl of my history. This time when Juan answered the\ndoor he told me Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell were waiting for me\nupstairs in the massage room. 1 began my hike up the familiar spiraling\nstaircase and through to the room where my arrival was being deeply\nanticipated. They were already in the steam room awaiting me to join\nthem. I undressed out of my uniform and folded them in a neat pile,\nwhich I placed upon the marble basin. Having one last look in the mirror\nbefore 1 exhaling a deep breath as if I was plunging into deep water, I\nknew today was a big day. I either accepted their offer and trade my\nmorals for opportunity, or walk away with the prospect of one day many\nyears from now trying to make it on my own which I knew endowed\nhardships of there own.\nSo confused about what decision to make, I just opened the door to the\nsteam room and let them do the talking. Used to the routine by now I sat\nbelow Jeffrey and began to massage his feet and legs as I listened in on\ntheir ongoing conversation about travel plans for the next few weeks.\nGhislane and Jeffrey turned their attention to me and he asked me how\nwould I like to go see the big city of Manhattan. I told them I had never\nvisited New York before and it sounded like an adventure but my job at\nMar-A- Lago was only a summer job and wouldn' t be able to get the time\noff, especially that summer was so busy anyways.\nJeffrey then made his announcement, that I should just quit my job at\nMar-a- Lago and become his permanent travelling masseuse. He then\nfurther persuaded me with all of the luxuries that came along with my\nacceptance. Rather than being paid $9 dollars per hour at my current job 1\ncould be earning $ 200 dollars per massage, which he even said could be a\nfew times a day. Tomorrow we could be leaving Palm Beach together in\nhis private jet first heading to his residence in the tipper east side of\nManhattan, also the largest mansion in N.Y, and would next be setting off\nto the Caribbean, where he owned a secluded island just past Little St.\nJames for a bit of relaxation. The temptation of his grandeur offer wasn' t\nhard to give into, my vulnerability to be lewd into his grasp seemed\ncomforting at the time. The idea that females were nothing more than an\nempty shell of beauty bound by only a body to offer was a notion I had\naccepted a long time ago with my first teacher, Ron.\nMy reaction had to be more than amusing for their egos, even though I\nwas excited to be traveling I could only imagine the likeliness of having\nto be at their beckon call as well. In my head I just told myself we all do\nwhat we have to do in our lives to succeed no matter what it takes, and\nwith no one knowing the truth, I had no one to talk me out of it. I\naccepted his offer and knew from here on out 1 would be his servant to\nhis sexual desires until one day I would gain my credentials and only then\ncould I go out on my own and make it in this world that when so young\nseems so unconquerable. The night advanced into the usual grooming of\nhis requirements, for the next hour and a half being exploited to satisfy\nJeffrey' s every sexual whim.\nMy mom cornered me that night, before I had a chance to avoid\nspeaking to anyone, heading to the shower then my bedroom, like I had\nbeen the last week. She knocked at my door with a hostile look in her\neyes, \" Virginia, what exactly does an older couple want with a fifteen\nyear old girl, who has no credentials and with no experience in massage\ntherapy?\" She used that stern tone of voice that she' s always had, when I\nwas in trouble.\nThus, as impressionable as I was, my blue eyes batted their innocence\nin her direction and I flashed her a girlish grin selling her the pitch that 1\nhad been given earlier that night. Not mentioning the other side to the\nglamorous lifestyle I would soon be living in. I told her about the money\nI' d be earning, the places I' d be seeing, the people I could meet and most\nof all the trade I' d be learning. It all sounded so good, except it was a\nbunch of lies 1 had to tell her and myself to otherwise convince its, that\nthis was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I had to take it.\nShe asked when all of this would start, and I as shocking as it was to me\ntoo, I told her I had to go start packing. We were leaving the next\nmorning off to N.Y.C. At fifteen most girls would be sucking up to their\nparents to go to a high- school dance or to go on a date to the movies with\na nervous chap, but I wasn' t even asking her. I was simply letting her\nknow that I would be away for the next couple weeks, maybe three and\nwould keep in contact when I got free time. Her daughter was lost a long\ntime ago, and she just now realized it. Backing out of the bathroom, with\nnothing she could say, she left me wondering to myself who I was\nbecoming.\nInstead of driving me to work the next morning my Dad dropped me off\nat Jeffrey' s mansion, he told me not to worry about calling Mar-A-Lago,\n33\n34\nI1 Copyright Nora tcd Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\nfl Copyright protected Mat, ­ 1\nGIUFFRE004166 CONCIDENRAL G11 JITRLOO4167\nhe' d take care of it for me. We said our good-byes outside in the\ndriveway, Jeffrey even coming outside to meet with my father to shake\nhis hands and assure him that his daughter will be more than looked after.\nI hugged my dad tightly, feeling like I was on the verge of a steep cliff,\nwhen he let go, so did the last of my innocence.\nJuan drove Jeffrey, Ghislane and I to Palm Beaches' Private Airport\nand the luggage handlers escorted us on the tar mat where we all boarded\non Jaffrey' s black jet. Larry was his main pilot, he had shiny grey hair\nand long lanky legs, but a very sincere smile that instantly made you feel\nat ease. He greeted us at the staircase that led into the main cabin. It was\nas lavish as I imagined it would be. The seats were enveloped in the finest\nbeige leather with polished wood grain finishes and there was a kitchen in\nthe back with an adjoining toilet. Jeffrey saw the amazement in my eyes\nand to make it more thrilling he brought me up to the cockpit and let me\nwatch with a bird' s eye view of the take off. I was on a natural high when\nI came back to the cabin and was instantly brought back down when\nJeffrey rested his bare feet on top of the reclined seat and instructed me to\nget to work and start massaging him. My future was in his hands now, so\nwhen he wanted something, I wouldn' t hesitate in giving it to him.\nChapter 6\nUpon our arrival at New Jersey' s Private Airstrip, the driver Jo -Jo met\nus. His name was most likely shortened for something of his oriental\ndecent. Jeffrey liked to shorten the names of his multi -cultural staff into\nAmerican names. Even Juan and Maria were known as John and Mary.\nWe arrived in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. His principal place of\nresidence was the largest home in Manhattan, eight stories of opulence. It\nused to be a Private School for boy' s many years ago, until Les Wexner,\nJeffrey' s best friend and mentor bought it for him as a mysterious gift.\nThere were two large Chinese gargoyles outside the entrance, and\nbeside the heavy looking wooden doors there was an intercom with a\ncamera overlooking us. I walked up the concrete steps into a realm of\nwealth, glamour and most of all influence. My eye' s glistened at the\nsplendor of his palace. Caramel colored marble tiles spread through the\nfirst floor, where his gourmet kitchen and dining hall were also located.\nThen I came to this sweeping staircase that curved into the next level\nwhere Jeffrey and I went into his office, even though it looked more like\na museum exhibit. Ancient draperies that told lascivious stories of their\nown covered parts of the elevated walls, and the remaining wall spaces\nwere taken up by rows on top of rows of books. He loved to read, as he\noften found it hard to sleep and was comforted in the early morning hours\nwith his literature, or sometimes in other ways 1 would come to find out.\nThere was a mantle piece and a sofa with two armchairs next to the grand\npiano that flaunted more of Jeffrey' s beautiful conquests, young women\nposing in salacious pictures, suggesting I could be easily replaced next to\none of those girls if I failed in keeping him satisfied. There were also\nsome pictures with recognizable political and royal figures either shaking\nJeffrey' s hand, or with an ann around each other, even one with Jeffrey\nand the Dali Lama, although his church was the bank. He liked to use his\npower, wealth, and money to manipulate everyone in his life.\nHe made a phone call that sounded business like and I didn' t mind, I\nwas quite enjoying taking in all of the beauty around me, I was blinded\nby all of it. I was still waiting for him when, Ghislane came in. She asked\nme what I thought so far of my trip to N. Y.C, I knew she was talking\nabout the house, she loved to gloat, even though none of it actually\nbelonged to her, she wanted everyone to believe that it did. I\ncomplimented her on the mid -evil looking tapestries and a few other\nadornments, when she cut me off mid -sentence to compliment it herself,\ntelling me the history about one of the 17\"' century tapestry' s which to an\nunsophisticated eye, looked to me like a rug on the wall.\nJeffrey hung the phone up and walked over to the sofa where we were\nsitting next to the mantle piece and took a seat on one of the armchairs.\nHe didn' t seem worried from the phone call but his mind was definitely\nsomewhere else from the hard look on his face_ We all spoke for a few\nmoments more about the splendid decor before Jeffrey had enough small\ntalk and needed some of his own relaxation time. He told Ghislane he\nwas going to show me to the massage room and he' d be back in a couple\nhours. She agreed he looked like he could use some time to unwind and\nwith that wry grin of hers, she gave me a look that told me precisely how\nhe was expecting to be relaxed.\nWe left his office all together, Ghislane going downstairs, and Jeffrey\nshowing me to the lifts. The lift looked like it' s original that came with\nthe school. It was made out of brass antique with archaic cuts throughout\nthe arches at the top. It wasn' t the only lift in the house, but certainly the\nmost beautiful. We walked down a long hall carpeted in a royal red and\ngolden trim, passing by a bronze pagan statue of the horny little goat God\nPan\". How adequate, I thought, fit Jeffrey to a tee. We walked into this\ndimly lit room. Another daunting chamber that looked like we had\nstepped back in time to the dark ages. It took a second for my eyes to\nadjust to the darkness, and Jeffrey beckoned me to follow him through\nthe room to the open adjoin shower, toilet and steam room. The room was\nin black marble to accent the dreariness, and smaller than the one in Palm\n35\nK%\nCopyright Protected Mateiiai\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004168 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRL'004169\nBeach, but it had it' s own witchery feel to it. Another unseen side to this\nMan 1 was coming to know.\nWe both undressed and I followed Jeffrey into the steam room first. He\nloved feeling clean, teaching me that the steam would deplete the toxins\nfrom your skin, which was great during a massage when your blood flow\nis being replenished. I grabbed his foot out of instinct, knowing I had to\nbe constantly on alert to keep this man satisfied. He looked down at me\nwith nod and reclined back against the wall as the steam pored in, this\nwas his idea of alleviation. I worked up to his calves and within a few\nmore minutes, he said he was ready for his massage on the bed. We got\nout and towel dried off, both still nude, he asked me to stay undressed,\nthen we headed to massage bed in the middle of the room. He lay down\non the bed and told me to turn on the CD player on the wall hutch, where\nall of the oils and lotions were set out, I hit play and a collection of mixed\nclassical symphonies began to fill the silence. I could tell he wasn' t in\none of those moods to be uplifted with idle chat, so I remained silent,\nletting him enjoy my slow movements, making my way up his body. My\ninstincts told me I was right about his mood, as he seemed to appreciate\nthe quietness of moment and the leisurely of the strokes I was using to\nmassage him. When I got to his scalp he turned over, and grabbed my\nhand to put on his erect manhood. No words spoken yet, I took the\ngesture and initiated what I had been taught over the last week. While\npleasing my master his hands groped my young flesh, penetrating my\ninsides with his fingers, he was only concerned with what he wanted, as\nIf I was a new car out for a test drive and he was pressing his new\ngadgets. His soft moans were soon brought to louder heaves of breath and\nmy job was done. No intimate kisses, or sweet pillow talk. He showed his\nappreciation with money, never attachment. We concluded with a shower\nand he told me he had some business to conduct. He walked me to the lift\nand told me go to the next level and my room was the first one on the\nright, it had an intercom in which he can contact me when needed.\nI hit number 5 on the lift and took his directions to my room. I opened\nthe door to this massive loft, the size of an adequate house. I walked\ndown the long hall and my eyes took in the magnificence of my\nsurroundings. It was a room fit for royalty, and later would find out had\nbeen stayed in by some. The room was trimmed in gold paint and had\nanother eerie tapestry on the main wall as feature. There was a T.V and a\nhuge king sized bed, with goose feathered comforter and pillows.\nAll of the glitter from Jeffrey' s lifestyle he was offering me finally\ncovered the last bit of sight I had left and I let go of my consciousness.\nExcited by my enthralling day, not having anyone around to have to act\nreserved, I jumped into the soft bed and lay looking around, thinking\nabout how quick life could change based upon one swift decision. Dazing\ninto the artistry, the intercom buzzed on the telephone next to the bed and\nit was a housemaid letting me know Jeffrey wanted to see me in his office\nnow. \" Already\" I thought to myself, I wasjust getting settled in. I was\nworried I was going to get lost in this ancient museum, but I got myself\nback to his office with no trouble, it was kind of hard to miss. I knocked\nat the slightly ajar door and Jeffrey called for me to enter. I walked over\nto his desk, where he was just ending a phone call and he opened his\nduffel bag full of money. \" I' ll be out at my other office for most of the\nday, so instead of being locked inside I thought you should go do some\nsightseeing for the day since it is your first trip to the Big Apple\" He\ndidn' t count how much he was giving me he just handed me a bundle out\nof the banded $ 100 dollar bills. He knew just how pull the right strings,\nmaking me squeal in delight and give him a kiss in the cheek, since we\nwere never really emotionally intimate, it would be odd to act in any\nother way, but he seemed to like it.\nI ran upstairs to get dressed for \" City\" shopping and put my make- up\non, then hit the streets of N.Y.C, looking for a place to start spending this\nload of dosh. When 1 got to the end of 72 A street on 5th Avenue, I had no\nidea which way to turn, left or right. I thought I' d just follow the lights\npast Central Park and see the local sights on my way. My eyes were once\nagain peeled back in splendor. I had never imagined a place so busy with\nthe hustle and bustle of all the walks of life. My first stop was to buy a\ndisposable camera and I was off taking photos of every wonder that\ncaught my attention. I didn' t do much shopping as I had planned too; I\nwas having too much fun exploring this capacious metropolitan.\nWhen it started to hit dusk I began walking back to Jeffrey' s but not\nbefore stopping off to enjoy a giant slice of pepperoni pizza, it was the\nbest I had ever had, and considering I was going back to Jeffrey' s\nchickpea and tofu salad' s or such. I really hated the healthy cuisine\nserved by Jeffrey' s personal chef. I was a naturally skinny girl, never\nwatching what I ate and to eat that food I might as well have chewed on\nhay. I strolled back to Jeffrey' s and was missed. Ghislane scolded me\nYou shouldn' t have been gone so long young lady\", \" We need to know\nwhere you are at all times, you are on call for Jeffrey\" I started to\napologize, feeling guilty, I didn' t want them to think T didn' t take my job\nwith them seriously. She cut off my explanation with a short conclusion\nto this conversation \" We will get you a cell phone tomorrow, so we can\nalways find you\". I thanked her for her generosity, and she dismissed me\nto my room. So I wasn' t even needed after all, it was just a way for her to\nplace me deeper in their control. The next few days I was on call, as\nGhislane said I' d be. Venturing out to the city for only an hour or so at a\ntime, I looked most forward to my outings. I would return to Jeffrey' s\n37\n38\nCI Copyright 11- ceted Material\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004170 CONFIDENTIAL G1UFFRE004171\nmansion to attend to his sexual desires and when he was finished with\nme, I' d be off to my adventures.\nOn the day before we were to be heading back to Palm Beach, Jeffrey\nhad a new proposition for me. I could make double the money I was\nmaking, if I would look for pretty girls and convince them to come back\nto Jeffrey' s to be further persuaded with money to engage in bi- sexual\nand sexual acts with Jeffrey and L I asked him how does one actually\npropose such a thing to a complete stranger? \" Well\" he said in a build up\nto another kind of lesson. \" If I were you I would use your charm to entice\nthem and my money to bring them, I would tell them you work for a\nmulti -billionaire who has a taste for young, beautiful girls and with his\ncontacts in the acting, modeling, or rich husband world, your boss could\nhelp them. All they have to do is come meet me first.\" If I wasn' t so\nnaive at the time I would' ve seen that' s exactly what he was doing with\nme, my prospects were massage credentials, but with too much pain from\nmy past, 1 could only have hope. Not that I was a shy girl, but picking up\ngirls for one reason alone, only to be endorsed for her body, didn' t sound\nlike something I could do. But not wanting to displease my master, I told\nhim that I would give it a go. You could tell he was instantly excited with\nmy agreement, he started to reveal the politics of what kind of girls he\nwas looking for. He wasn' t into multi -cultural girls, a very chauvinistic\nperception; he said they had to be uniquely gorgeous to be accepted by\nhim, but definitely no African-American girls, he was racist against\nanything different to his kind, a very narrow minded way of thinking for\nsuch a supposed brilliant man. The list went on and on. No girls with\ntattoo' s or piercing' s, or gothics, no drug users, or prostitutes. Basically\nhe wanted everyone' s daughter that looked like the girl next door, with\nblue eyes and blonde curly ringlets. I just nodded and smiled, wanting\nthis to be over with and move on to another conversation, but so worked\nup from our previous talk, instead he persisted to show me exactly what I\nwas good for to him. He took me up to the highest loft in his large\nmansion and he lay down on his large bed, expecting me to know exactly\nwhat he wanted done. As always, I complied. Part of me hating him for\nhaving to degrade myself to be so subservient to his sexual whims, and\nanother part of me was telling myself to be grateful for the opportunities I\nwas being given.\nThe battles in my head were beginning to cause me too much anxiety,\nwhen we got back to Palm Beach, I asked my Mom to make me a\ndoctor' s appointment for some headaches I had been getting lately, so she\nwouldn' t question me. I walked out of the doctor' s with a prescription for\na mind -altering anxiety tablet called \" Xanax\", not only did it help with\nanxiety but it also acted as blanket over terrible memories. So when I had\nto perform degrading acts, I would take a few pills and forget what\nhappened within the next hour and be able to become someone without a\nbattling conscious.\nI spent my sweet 16\"' birthday on his island in the Caribbean next to\nSt. James Isle\" he liked to call it \" Little St. Jeffs\", his ego was as\nenormous as his appetite for fornicating. I was given a birthday cake and\na new collection of designer make- up from London. Ghislane made a\njoke after I blew out my array of candles and said, \" I' d be soon getting\ntoo old for Jeffrey' s taste, and soon they' d have to trade me in.\" She was\nonly halfjoking in a sad reality though. A few days after my birthday, a\ngirl was flying out to the island to join us for a few days before flying\nback to N. Y.C. I was introduced to a pretty girl a few years my senior,\nnamed Sarah. She had long ash blonde hair and big brown eyes that\nhinted she had a cheeky nature. She had known Jeffrey before I had, and\nhe was supposedly trying to help her get an acting job in L. A. She was\nobviously accustomed to the lifestyle he provided her, making it ever so\napparent with her prompt attention she lavished on him. She would do\nthings like strip nude and bathe around the swimming pool, taunting him\nfor sex. She was good at what she did, even putting me at ease with her\ncool persona and funny jokes. Jeffrey told me privately that she was one\nof his best at procuring young girls into her entrapment and delivering\nthem to him when he was in town, and when it came to time in the private\nchambers with Jeffrey, Her and I, it wasn' t hard to comprehend. She was\ndevoted to the moment, giving Jeffrey every imaginable lustful desire he\ncould fathom. On the last night there we all took a trip over to St. James\nto go for a stroll, odd I thought, it was past 7pm and Jeffrey rarely strayed\nout past then, unless it was some event or dinner party. While Ghislane\nand him looked the average couple strolling arm in arm through the\nstreets, he said to Sarah and I, \" Why don' t you two hit the night club here\nand see if there is anyone interesting to bring back for the evening?\" It\nwas more of an order than a request and then 1 knew why we came out\ntonight and why Sarah was invited, tonight was all about training, and\nSarah was going to show me the ropes in picking up girls. Although there\nwas no one to accustom to Jeffrey' s distinct taste to bring back, watching\nSarah flirt from girl to girl like a floating butterfly, gave me enough\ninsight into what I was expected to do.\nWithin Months I had become his handy little helper. Not only would I\nnm to his beckon call, but I also aided Ghislane in bringing in more girls\nto keep the appetite of our sexually starving chief from going hungry. I\nonce asked Ghislane, why she did what she did for him, instead of having\na common monogamous relationship and getting jealous like normal\npartners would? She replied simply \" It takes the pressure off me having\nto do it\". That said it all, we were all tinder the shade of Jeffrey' s money\ntree, and not even someone like her could escape from its lure.\n39\n40\nLI Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDEN1 1AL\nCopyright Protected Material\nGIUFFRE004172 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004173\nJust like Ghislane had trained me it was now my job to reiterate that\nonto other girls and thus the cycle of girls trying to climb the chain of\nhierarchy would start all over each time I brought a new one in. The\nsessions rarely differed much. They would mostly start out with Jeffrey\non top of the massage table already naked and me leading a girl into\nmassaging him until his instructions came to remove our clothing and if\nthey agreed to that, then Jeffrey knew he had them in his pocket, and\ncould do what ever else he wanted. He was never turned down in the\nmany years I stayed with him. Never being shy, he would tell us to start\nkissing each other or depending on what he wanted we would perform\nerotic acts sometimes with him fondling us, or just masturbating while he\nwatched. On explicit occasions, sex toys would be used on us girls,\nmaking it all the more exciting for him to observe. Ending with a\npayment of $200 for the new girl and $400 to me for bringing her. He\nwould then wait for us to leave before adding the events details of names\nand payments in a little black diary he kept with him wherever he went,\nso if he were in anyone of the city' s he lived in, he would always have\ncontacts for sex.\nI was slowly climbing the ladder, as Jeffrey was happy taking me\neverywhere with him, within the States. Merely at home I distanced\nmyself from my Family altogether and with Jeffrey renting me an\napartment in Royal Palm Beach as well as a plush furnished apartment in\nN. Y. C, there was hardly a need to see them. I just couldn' t face everyone\nthinking they all knew what I was really doing travelling around with a\nman old enough to be my grandfather who supposedly only wanted me\nfor massages. Much further convincing myself of the lies I told myself, I\ntook a liking to the Xanax, it felt like it was all a dream at times, even\nmeeting up with old contacts from school years who experimented with\ndrugs. I was flying around the country, seeing so many places in America\nI had only heard about in Movies and making more money than anyone\nmy age and loving it. My friends didn' t believe the lies I told them about\nonly being a massage therapist, some of them even asking if they can\nmeet Jeffrey too. At this point in my life my heart went missing for a\nwhile and I stooped so low, I was even bringing my friends, I just saw\nthem as easy commission. When I wasn' t playing servant to my master, I\nwas partying hard, eventually using ecstasy pills, acid, and marijuana to\ndisillusion the times I would' ve had away from Jeffrey to think about\nwhat I was actually doing with my life. I realized something one day\nwhile I was alone, although I had Jeffrey to attend to sexually, it was not\ngratifying. I needed someone to come home to, someone I could call my\nboyfriend and that showed me emotion not just a job to get done.\nChapter 7\nA knock came to my apartment door one lazy afternoon while we were\nin Palm Beach. I looked through the peephole and didn' t recognize the\nonce familiar face. I asked from behind the closed door \" Who is it\"? The\nvoice of the reply was one I wasn' t anticipating to ever hear again. It was\nmy Junior -High crash and childhood friend, T. J. The last time I saw him I\nwas a runaway and he had let me stay at his house for a few days, telling\nhis parents nothing, he kept me hidden away in his room. At nightfall he\nsaid to knock on his window and I could jump through and stay the night.\nUntil I was picked up by authorities during school hours and questioned\nwhy I wasn' t in school they did some resourcing finding out I was a\nrunaway, then delivered me back to my angry parents.\nOh My God- You finally answer your door girl\", and in a whirlwind,\nT.J stormed back into my life. Even moving into my apartment, secretly,\nwithin two weeks of his arrival. He had changed so much from the last\ntime I had seen him. He used to be this hard looking rocker type, now he\nwas cleaned up wearing preppy clothes and shooting out Tupac Lyrics.\nHe had the same old big brown eyes though, and when he told me lie had\nheard I was back in town but he was unable to ever get ahold of me he\njust kept knocking at my door every so often, I was sold. How sweet I\nthought, he must care about me if he was so intent on approaching me,\nnot even thinking he would' ve spoken to the girls from our junior -high\ncircle and they would' ve mentioned him I was back in town, what I was\ndoing and where to find me. We were a drug- induced romance, which\nbudded from fake emotions the affects made us feel. He got what he\nwanted, a free ride and not having to work, and I got what I deserved, a\nman who could let me go away with this multi -billionaire I regarded as\nmy second boyfriend.\nI didn' t want to alarm Jeffrey in me having a boyfriend so I kept it\nquiet, until during a massage I was giving to him one afternoon. We were\nhaving a conversation about some of my friends, the party girls I had\nbrought in to meet him. Jeffrey started asking questions about the\ndifferent types of drugs they used hearing them speak about it in his\npresence. \" I thought a person on drugs would be all strung out and\nlooking like hell, but the girls you know look great\" he stated face down\nduring the massage.\nThat' s when I told him I had been dabbling in ecstasy lately too, and I\nthought it was the most amazing feeling one could even fathom. I tried to\ndescribe the euphoric feelings it gave me and even joked with him about\nwanting to pet anything furry that was around and then there was the\nconstant need to flick my tongue -ring around my mouth. It was great\n41\n42\nI I Copyright Protected Material\nCONI' InLNrIAL\nL Copyright Protected Material\nGIUFFRE'004174 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRL'004175\nhaving such an open conversation about things Jeffrey had never\nexperienced before and he seemed okay with everything I was telling him\nas we were having a good laugh together, so I thought I could push it a bit\nfurther and tell him the truth about T. J, since it was bound to come out\nsooner than later I' d rather not the latter, when it would look even worse\nthat I kept the truth from him for so long.\nWell why were opening up about things together\", 1 continued by\nsaying \" I had met someone from my past and we have been hanging out a\nlot lately. When 1 haven' t been travelling with you I have been with him\nand I was wondering if you minded if 1 started to see this guy.\" He started\nto laugh out loud, \" Are you serious? Of course not, no one in this world is\nmonogamous, why would I expect you to be?\" I was smitten with relief,\nbut a little bit dis- heartened when I heard him speak that way and I\nwondered to myself if he' d had his own personal encounter with\nheartache.\nOf course the evening concluded in the same way it always had, the only\nreason I was really even there in the first place. Upon his request I\nstraddled him on top of the table and let him explode with pleasure inside\nof me. Thinking the entire time about T. J, I felt so terrible but I quickly\nhad to wipe the thoughts of guilt from my mind not to give Jeffrey the\nwrong impression. So I had myself busy with two men in my life, but\nthat' s not what I really wanted for myself. I wanted an occupation that\nwould eventually set me free from depending on a man as my source of\nsurvival.\n1 asked Jeffrey before I left for the evening, when my real training was\ngoing to begin and he liked my assertiveness. I thought it meant to him\nthat I was taking my job with him seriously, but it was all part of his\nmaster plan to keep me by his side. Within a couple of weeks of my\npersistence, Jeffrey introduced me to a couple of real working massage\ntherapists, not only with credentials but with their own clientele too. I\nwas in awe of their teachings, it all made so much sense about the body\nand what they were saying. I felt like I had picked myself up out of the\nlurches and had a direction again.\nI was in the middle of another training session, with Jeffrey the\nrecipient as usual, being it was rare for Ghislane to ask for a massage\nunless of course it was for Jeffrey' s own pleasure to watch the punch line\nof the session, when I was shocked to hear Jeffrey ask one of the\ntherapists to now remove her shirt. He had no shame I thought. Even\nthough she was above his usual age criteria, she was still a pretty woman\nin her early 30' s with curly blonde hair and had an athletic body for a\nmother of two children. She didn' t hesitate in his request. It looked like\nsomething out of a role-playing porn scene with the therapist removing\nher white uniform to reveal her beautiful nude body and a much darker\nside to her personality.\nI couldn' t believe it at first it was such a state of shock and i began to\nquestion t myself if this was non -nal in the massage profession to expect\nthis kind of clientele to request such degrading tasks even though they\nwere professionals. At the end of the session she was paid $300 dollars an\nadditional hundred for helping to train me as well, and I was paid my\nusual $ 200 dollars then we were both invited by Jeffrey to join him out\nby the pool for a cool dip. With Jeffrey making a few phone calls while\nher and 1 undressed again for a swim, l wanted to ask her a few personal\nquestions about what she' s come to learn about the Massage Therapy\ngame, but I never got the chance as we were joined by Ghislane moments\nlater. She was asking how my training was going and booked the\ntherapist in for herself in the following morning. Where she was invited\nback to do another training session with me. It didn' t take me long to\nfigure out why.\nI was at my apartment when I received a phone call from Jeffrey, I\nthought it was the usual call to come over to his house, but he surprised\nme. Instead I would be going to the exclusive hotel in Palm Beach\ntonight, The Breaker' s, where I would be meeting my first ever clients.\nOnly told their first names I was given some instructions and the address\nwhere to meet Glen and Eva. They were a married couple with one on the\nway. I was quite concerned when I heard she was pregnant, being I really\ndidn' t know the body that well and didn' t want to inflict any wrong doing\non the unborn baby but Jeffrey insisted I take this job. Just massage her\ngently where she wants to be rubbed and to save all of my energy for\nGlen' s massage, since it was going to be a four-hour job. In an\nemphasized tone of voice I was being coached by Jeffrey to treat Glen\nwith exactly whatever he wanted, just like I do for Jeffrey himself. It was\nmy last bit of preparation before he sent me out to his friends and my first\ntaste of responsibility in upholding his reputation.\nAt around seven pm I took a taxi to the address I was given and found\nthem on the residential side of the giant hotel' s extensive property. When\nI arrived in their apartment it was a far cry from the lavish place I was\nexpecting, still really nice but had a cozier family feel to it. It was just\nbeginning to get dark when Eva and I went into the Master Bedroom and\nshe undressed to reveal the first naked pregnant body I had ever seen. It\nwas fascinating to see her in the later stages of maternity, and strangely\nenough it was a miraculous and wondrous sight. She was a former model\nand one of Jeffrey' s many entourages from his past that had gotten to old\nfor his taste and was married off to a wealthy colleague of his.\nLying down on the bed I adjusted the pillows to try and make her more\ncomfortable and 1 began to massage her as Jeffrey had instructed me to,\n43\n44\nII Copv ght proiectod Material\ni] Copyright protected Matorial\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004176 CONPIDEN' I 1AL GlUITRE004177\nsoftly and slowly. So at ease with her nude body she even asked me to\nmassage her swelling breasts, in a non- sexual way. Not knowing any\nother way but that way, I was trying to oblige in her request doing the\nvery best I could to relieve her but couldn' t help but giggle to myself at\nthe very sight of this. She said she was very happy at the end of the\nmassage and rolled over to go to sleep, asking me to turn out the light at\nthe end of it. I closed the door gently as if not to disturb her, and went to\nfind my other client.\nThe apartment' s lights had been turned out for the sleeping children and\nI found Glen awaiting for me in the lounge room where I had to call out\nExcuse me?\" as I couldn' t see him in the dark. There was a throw rug on\nthe ground that he had already placed out as he began to strip down in\npreparation of the massage. Lying frontwards facing me with his exposed\nand ever growing manhood, I asked him to roll over to begin the\nmassage. He complied with a cheeky smile and from his eagerness to\nshow he was not shy indeed, I already knew where this was going to end\nup.\nI found it much more strenuous to massage on the floor but I wouldn' t\nlet that hold me back I wanted to have a career and this being my first\never clients, I didn' t want them to disapprove. Nearly four hours after I\nhad gotten there I was still hard at work. Mentally preparing for the end\nof the session he let me know when he was ready to begin the other side\nto my job and just like Jeffrey did the first time, he requested me to take\noff my clothes starting with my shirt. When I complied, the requests kept\ncoming in and before I could change my mind and run away, I was\nhaving intercourse with this man that was so comfortable doing all of this\nwhile his pregnant wife and children slept in the room beside us. When\nhe had climaxed, we both got up and dressed and he paid me a large tip\neven though Jeffrey would be the one to actually pay me for my time\nspent there. Just like it had all started, it had also ended so quickly and\nnow that was that. 1 had to accept what my duties were and now I could\ngo back to Jeffrey who would be further pleased in my demonstrations to\nkeep him happy.\nI was called the next morning to come over to Jeffrey' s mansion that\nafternoon for hmch, a swim and of course a massage session. Knowing\nall too well they' d be expecting the gory details of last nights events with\nmy new clientele. I came there at 1pm as requested and sat down for a\nlight lunch and a swim. Jeffrey was mostly conducting business from his\noffside pool office, but he came to ask me if everything went well the\nnight before. I told him I did everything asked of me and I am quite\nconfident both my client' s were more than pleased with me. He gave me\na quick grin, before he headed back to the office, throwing a purple grape\ndown his throat as he walked away.\nLying out on one of the pool decks blue and white striped lounge beds\nI was waiting for Jeffrey to finish his business so I could give him his\nmassage. He never took too long with his work, unless there was\nsomething wrong and then we would all have to wear his mood but today\nhe seemed fine though, when we went up the stairs he told me we would\nbe leaving for his ranch in Santa Fe', New Mexico in the morning and I' d\nneed to be packed and ready tonight. They loved leaving in the spur of\nthe moment, Jeffrey once said he checks with his pilot Larry on the best\nweather before he heads to a different destination. I enjoyed spending\ntime at his ranch being it was my favorite of all of his residences. He had\na lavish Mediterranean looking castle on top of a hill that over looked his\nextensive 7, 500 acres of property. It has an indoor pool, gym, and all the\ntrimmings of extravagance I could only imagine. I had a great time on the\nquad bikes, Sarah and I often got scolded for tipping one over going to\nfast or trying to go up a steep hill, but we knew those weren' t the things\nhe cared about, so it wouldn' t matter. My favorite of it all was his little\ntown with it' s own fire station and truck, stables full of horses, and little\ncottages where the housekeepers and ranch hands lived.\nOn my own time I would take one of the quad bikes down to the\nstables and saddle up on one of his beautiful horses and go for a ride in\nthe open terrain. It was coming up to the end of a very cold winter and it\nstill had the snow covered mountaintops and brisk air that I loved to take\nin during my many trail rides. I have been an experienced horse rider\nsince my childhood, and could honestly pinpoint some of the best\nmemories of my life being on the back of a horse. I acclaimed with thrill\nin my voice \" Great, I' ll get packed as soon as I get back to my apartment\"\nhe threw in \" Pack for a few weeks, as we will also be making a pit stop\nto L.A for some business afterwards and then to N. Y. C.\" I was used to\nthese round trips with him, it was great as I was saving loads of cash and\nabout to buy myself my first car.\nJeffrey, Ghislane, Emmy and I all left the following morning, as\nplanned. Arriving in only a few hours at his awe- inspiring Santa Fe\nPalace was always a delight. Still frisk in the air, my petite frame looked\neven smaller in these gigantic overcoats. Nonetheless I was looking\nforward to spending time out in the fresh clean air and open land. After a\nfew days of leisurely spending our time on the ranch, we went to the\nIndian markets in Albuquerque for a bit of shopping and sight seeing.\nJeffrey wasn' t the most off road kind of guy, so when we went sight\nseeing it was more like museums, boutique shopping, and local art\ngalleries. Still a splendid trip though. With me picking up a few nifty\ncollectables to bring back for my family and knowing how much my\nmom loves Indian apparel, I thought it would put me back in her good\nbooks for awhile, I hoped at least. There was some lengthy time to put a\n45\n46\nCopyright Protected Mate -1\nCopyright Protected Matc W\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004178 CONFIDEN'r1AL G1UITRE004179\nlittle water under the bridge between my folks and 1. With my life\nheading in a different direction l didn' t see any use in holding on to so\nmuch hate especially that I didn' t even have to see them that much.\nWe got back to \" Zorro Ranch\", the name Jeffrey chose to call the\nmassive land he bought to build his fortress on, and Jeffrey told me that\nhe was looking forward to one of my famous relaxing massages and with\nthat notion he gave my bags of shopping to one of the many housemaids\nwho greeted us at the front door and asked her to bring my bags to the\nexquisite room I was staying in. We headed straight downstairs just past\nthe massage room and gym there is an indoor heated pool, shower and\nspa. First Jeffrey wanted to warm up in the spa underneath a decorated\nceiling of clouds and blue skies. Starting the massage in the spa I rubbed\nhis feet while he reclined into the spa' s jets. We spoke of the museum and\nsome of the knick- knacks I had bought and I thanked him for the\nturquoise earrings and necklace he had got for me as a gift, joking about\nnot ever knowing what to get for him, being that he was richest man I' d\never known. By no far means did we ever have any kind of a mutual\nrespectful bond between us, but there was a significant softer side he\nbegan to share with me that was different from how he treated his other\ngirls. Maybe it was my feet that filled the shoes for that time being, or the\nfact my novelty hadn' t worn off yet, but what ever it was I was getting\nconfused from the double -sided life I was leading.\nHe got up from the spa tub shortly thereafter and asked me to come\nwash him in the shower. It was nothing unordinary to me, I was used to\nhis need to be nurtured and pampered. 1 performed his request with a\ncheerful mannerism, letting him think 1 was taking care of him out of my\nsheer sweetness. I got the towels ready for him to get out of the shower\nand towel dried him, patting his skin instead of rubbing as previously\ninstructed. \" You know you have a very maternal instinct, you' ll make a\nfine mother someday\", he would constantly acclaim at my gentleness. \" I\nhope so\" 1 replied, I would love to have my own babies one day, but not\nany time soon\". Laughing at the very thought of that.\nWe walked up the steps and through the French doors into the gym' s\nadjoining massage room. It was smaller room than in his other houses,\nplacing the emphasis on the large massage bed in the center. I grabbed\nanother clean towel to keep him warm while I prepared the music, lights,\nand oils. He liked me to use mostly lavender or other aromatherapy\nscents, which reminded me of woodlands in the spring. Always enjoying\nthe beginning of the massage, I put my heart and soul into training in my\nprofession. I could just close my eyes I would see only with my hands the\nareas that needed the most work, and even though I wasn' t a professional\nyet, Jeffrey could feel and told me there wasn' t many that could please\nhim during a massage being untrained. I' m sure now it was just\nsomething he' d say nice to all the girls, but in the time I had known him l\ncould honestly say it wasn' t like him to compliment girls in any other\nway than regards to a sexual performance or their looks. I was flattered at\nhis praise and when the massage was over, so were the sentiments. I was\nback to being used for my body and what I could do with it.\nWith him satisfied and off for a nap, I could go do what ever I wanted,\nlike usually I would go down to the stables or something adventurous, but\ntoday I was in a melancholy mood, just wanting to relax and unwind\nmyself in a giant tub in my bathroom. 1 got out some of the oils I used on\nJeffrey putting them in the steaming water and popped two of my Xanax\npills, forgetting about my troubles and focusing on the quiet moment at\nhand, just wanting to soak up the peacefidness of it. Nearly slipping away\nto sleep in the tub, I was startled when I got the call on the intercom to\ncome down for dinner.\nEverybody seemed in good spirits at dinner, which helped to lift mine.\nWe all ate our meals and went into the movie room to watch a newly\nreleased movie. It was a ritualistic scenario, most nights that everyone\nwas at ease we would all sit in one of his various located movie rooms\nand hang out together. Just as he always would Jeffrey asked Emmy and\nme to both grab a foot during the movie that night and just keep\nmassaging through the film. We were always on call for duty, no matter\nwhere we were or what ever time it was. He would just plop a foot up or\npass over his hand at any given time and require a massage, even if the\nfilm went on for over two hours, I would still be required to sit on the\nfloor rubbing his feet or hands, and even his scalp at times. After the\ncredits had rolled Ghislane got up to close the door to the room and I\nknew she had received the signals herself and would proceed to\nmanipulate, violate, and use us to satisfy Jeffrey' s urges once more before\nhe went to bed.\nThe blue illumination from the empty T.V screen was glaring in the\ntenebrous room as we watched her undress in a light that relied on the\nreflection of the moon through the windows peek to show it' s proceeding\ndisplay. She walked back to the sofa where I was sitting at Jeffrey' s feet\nstill rubbing away and uncovered her shirt displaying ample bosoms for\nhis appeal. Approaching me like a lioness hunting her prey she stood me\nup and led me to the other couch across from Jeffrey and situated herself\non top of me, sliding her fingers through my dress to unbutton my attire,\nrevealing my girlish figure and two small peaks. Pushing my head into\nher breasts I was being fondled by Emmy at the same time, which took\nher cue when she saw Ghislane look in my direction. From an occasional\nglance upwards, I could see that Jeffrey was up to his methodical foreplay\nstroking his manhood while watching the build up to his main event.\nThey both took turns making me moan from their touches and when\n47\n48\nCopyright Protected Material\nU Copyright Protected Mammal\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004190 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004 181\nGhislane was ready too she would insinuate we do the same to her. She\nurged me downwards, until my head was between her opened legs and\ngiving into her wanton indulgence. Twenty minutes passed before Jeffrey\nexerted his last energies for the night, the only advantage of being with an\nold man was they could never last long.\nDeparting to our own separate quarters for the night, I called T. J for\ncondolence. It was so important for me to feel like I had someone out\nthere who saw me as more than a pretty girl with vulnerabilities. I needed\nto maintain some sort of a connection to my youthful side. But it would\nbe to no avail as I was getting used to being badly disappointed by all the\nmen in my life.\nChapter 8\nThe phone nearly rang out and as I was about to hang up the receiver\nwhen he finally picked up. On the other end of the phone I could hardly\nhear T.J above the background noises. When I asked where he was he\ntold me \" At our place baby\", meaning the apartment Jeffrey had rented\nfor me to be staying in alone. He already sounded off his chops\nelongating his words and slurring his speech. There was music pumping\nand people shouting behind him and every one sounded like they were\nhaving a great time. I was so sick of his friends coining over using my\nhouse as a place to party and then trashing it so bad I would even have to\nsometimes throw my furniture out. I blew up at him over the phone and\nthreatened to kick him out, back to his parent' s house, so much for my\nrelaxing evening I thought to myself venturing on to tell him \" You leech\noff me using the money I leave behind for you for drugs and throw these\ngigantic parties while I' m away.\" Also mentioning the disastrous messes\nI would come home too. \" I am so close to ending it with you\", I would\nopenly threaten, but he knew better than I did, that I just couldn' t bring\nmyself to do so, needing some attachment to my youth through all of this.\nDon' t worry baby\" he would say attempting to soothe me with his false\nwords going on to tell me how much he was missing me and how he was\nalways thinking about me when I was away which was like all the time.\n1 would soon be buttered up and soft for serve. This was my penalty for\nchoosing a guy that accepted my lifestyle with my \" Other -Man\" as I had\nso eloquently put it to him once as not only acceptable but deemed it\nCool\". The conversation ended with an easy good-bye and no \" I-Love-\nYou' s\" or anything sweet. We weren' t those kinds of partners yet, so\nmuch time spent away from each other and the lifestyles we both led, I\ncouldn' t expect much more from him than what we already had.\nJeffrey and I left two days later, heading off to Cannel in California for\na business trip of his, leaving Ghislane and Emmy to catch a commercial\nflight back to N.Y.C, where we would meet up with them later. When we\narrived at the hotel we were given badges for the meeting tomorrow and\nsettled into our rooms. We got adjoining rooms, keeping the doors open\nat all times, but sleeping in different beds. He liked sleeping alone, even\nafter late night session I would always go back to my own room. I think\nthat' s why he liked me so much I never put pressure on him to become\nintimately more than what we were already, never giving him the\nimpression I wanted more than what we had. It seemed to keep him\nhappy just the way we were together. I bung out with Jeffrey that night,\ngoing to a restaurant for dinner and afterwards watching a movie back at\nthe hotel.\nThe next morning we went for an early morning breakfast before the\nconference and Jeffrey gave me some money to go shopping instead of\nattending the all day meeting with him. I was more than obliged to accept\nhis request, and wished him a good day before planning to meet back in\nthe room around six pm. He gave me five hundred dollars. He said it was\njust enough to go have fun for the day and a girl of my means could find\nplenty to do with that kind of money. I walked around the many\nboutiques that lined the streets of the picturesque cozy town, and picked\nup some bits of clothing here and there and even met a girl who was\npassing through on a road trip. She was somewhere in her late teens with\ngolden sunshine tresses, olive skin and blue eyes. Her name escapes me,\nas it was so unexpected, I think it was Tina or something like that but she\nwas your typical California carefree chic, offering me a few tokes of her\njay as we ducked down a side street together. I was so happy I had met\nthis girl, as she was fun spirited and charismatic a relief from the social\nexpectations I had come to know lately, but always being \" on- call\" as I\nhad been trained up to be, I ended up inviting her back to meet Jeffrey at\nour hotel later on as a surprise for him. Maybe she was just a bit too\ncarefree for Jeffrey' s taste but anyhow she was pretty enough to let him\nbe the judge of that matter.\nOver the next hour of hanging out together I found out that she was on\na road trip with her best friend who was still sleeping off the hard night of\npartying from the night before. She was originally from the southern\nstates as she had a bit of draw still left in her accent, and she had recently\nleft her boyfriend because he was leaving for a college too far away not\nbelieving in long distance relationships. Then it was my turn to dish out\nmy contribution to the conversation of getting to know each other better. I\nalways got anxiety before I would tell a girl what I did for work and\nromance ( as such), morally I was ashamed of who I was especially with a\ngirl having led somewhat of a normal life. Next, as always, I expected to\n49\n50\nU Copyright Protected Material\nU Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUITRE004182 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRL0041U\nbe probed with so many more questions and having to make Jeffrey\nsound ideal and hot for the taste of a young girl and knew I would be\npoint blank lying, so I told her some of the truth which was that he was\nreally rich and paid good money for a massage and useful to have around\nas a contact. I told her he' d give her two hundred dollars for a two- hour\nmassage with me leading the way and warning her he was known to be\nfrisky during the session. Unexpectedly she said she could use the money\nand then came the part that I hated the most, but had to do so they\nwouldn' t be as shocked as I was the first time I had met him. \" He does\nlike us to be nude though and sometimes asks for more than just the\nmassage itself'. All I could do was wait for a response after a shocking\nsentence like that, and depending on the girl, most were sadly taken back\nby the money. Her carefree attitude seemed to disillusion for a moment\nwhen she gave it some thought and asked me \" He' s not like, fat and ugly,\nis he\"? \"\"\nNo ... no ... not at all\" I replied, \" He' s got more of a Richard\nGere appeal to him\". Trying to make him sound a little more measurable\nthan just a rich old man that likes to be with girls younger than half his\nage. \" Well then, what time shall we meet tonight\"? She asked next.\nGreat, I thought, Jeffrey would be most pleased with my find. \" Knock on\nmy room quietly, you' re going to be a surprise. Be there at around half\npast seven tonight and I will introduce you to Jeffrey\". She threw the butt\nof the second jay we shared in the bushes and we strolled into a\nhomemade fudge boutique to get some relief for the munchies we now\nhad.\nWhen I got back to the hotel at around a quarter to six o' clock pm as\nrequested 1' d be, nobody was back yet, so I took the time to set up the\noils and bath in my room for his massage tonight. I thought I would plan\nit so the girl would be cleaning off, as Jeffrey liked before he had sexual\ncontact with a new girl and he could walk in and be surprised to find a\nstrange beautiful girl in my room who wanted to massage him. Jeffrey\nwalked through the door not long after I was done prepping for the night\nahead, looking like he had a rough day at the office, which was very rare\nfor him. He sat down on the bed and I asked him how his day was. He\ndidn' t want to talk much about it, saying it was boring and long, rather\nasking what I got up to for the day. Being coy about having a jay and his\nunexpected surprise to come, I told him it was a great day of shopping\nand sight seeing and I even brought him back some local made Ridge\nfrom the shop that had fulfilled my chocolate cravings only hours ago.\nTelling him of the places I ventured into I mentioned to him \" We' d\nhave to hit the fisherman' s wharf tomorrow. I saw some locals walking\naround with breadbaskets filled with creamy clam chowder and it smelled\nabsolutely scrumptious.\" He said if the weather were nice we' d check it\nout tomorrow before we left for L.A. He wanted to take off his jeans and\ncollared shirt and put on his normal attire of sweatpants and a sweatshirt.\nUshering him out the door for dinner when he was more relaxed I was\nlucky when he said he was starving and quickly got dressed. We just\nfound a quite spot to eat that was next to the wharf and got back to the\nhotel just in time for our surprise guest. He wanted to go have a shower\nand settle down for a massage, so I told him I' d join him in a minute, I\njust had to make a phone call real quick which he thought was odd and\nasked me if everything was alright, I reinstated that I' d just be a minute,\ntrying not to let on about anything. The knock came quietly on my\nroom' s door just on time, as we had planned and I told her my idea to\nsurprise him. I let her into the bathroom where she orchestrated my plan\nperfectly. Jeffrey finished his shower without me and when he called out\nfor me I told him that I needed him to have a look at something in my\nroom real quick. Not giving in to what it was that he would be looking at,\nhe came into the room where I opened my bathroom door to reveal a\nbeautiful nude girl bathing in a thick amount of soap bubbles in my tub\nlooking at him with an alluring intrigue. His grin went from ear to ear\nwhen she stood up and introduced herself letting the bubbles run down\nher glistening body at an ever -slow pace. It was a proud moment for\nJeffrey, I had done well in his eyes, and she was not like the other girls I\nhad brought to him before, degraded from a lifetime of abuse off the\nstreets. This girl was exactly his pro quo looking sweet and innocent as\nthe girl next door. My efforts were to show him I knew that my only\nresponsibility was to keep him happy at all costs. I led her through the\nmassage on Jeffrey and of course afterwards gratifying his perversion\nwith his lustful requests to be fondled and watch us become more than\njust friends. I didn' t feel too bad at the time with his coercion providing\nmany financial rewards making his scheme enticing to a young,\nimpressionable teen not realizing the terrible memories left to come from\nall of this. Afterwards he paid her the usual two hundred dollars he gave\nto everyone for their time and took down her name and phone number\nwriting it in his infamous little black book of the contacts he met in every\ncity but only the ones he really liked made it down in his records.\nWe went out the next afternoon as I had suggested last night and we ate\nour clam chowder breadbaskets over looking the wharfs bay, watching\nthe seals playfully barking at each other on the rocks nearby. Shortly after\nwe were driven to the private airstrip and took off for Los Angeles. On\nthe plane was an unexpected visitor. Matt Groening the producer of the\nThe Simpson' s\" T.V show was catching a ride with us. I was so excited,\nas I loved watching his show and acted like a star struck fan, asking him\neverything from his initial idea for creating the show to where he got his\ncharacters from. He told me it was all based on his own family make up,\n51\n52\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENI IAL\nCopynght Protected Material\nGIUFFRE004184 CONFIDEN'r1AL GIUFFRE004185\nbut without the crazy father and son scenes of Homers hand around Bart' s\nthroat.\nI was enjoying our conversation, when Jeffrey insisted that I give Matt\na foot massage throughout the duration of the short flight. I never turned\ndown a client but when I saw the shape of his feet, I nearly threw up at\nthe thought of having to touch them. He had yellow crusty toenails that\neven someone with a chainsaw would' ve had troubles cutting through\nand then there was the fluffy balls of leftover pieces of sock wedged\nbetween the crevices of his sweaty toes, now that was the real icing on\nthe cake for me, no way could I attempt this I thought. Then I had an\nidea. I went to the back of the plane and rinsed a wash cloth in warm\nsoapy water and returned for his dreaded foot massage but not before\nattempting to clean them first.\nIn return for my services Matt was kind enough to draw me two quick\nsketches on blank paper from his briefcase of my two favorite characters,\nHomer and Bart. I asked if he would make them out to my little brother\nand dad, the true fans of the family not missing an episode during dinner\nover the past ten years or so. Next to the A- 4 size drawing he was able to\nfit in the quote \" To my greatest fan from Matt Groening\" and their names\nnext to it. I knew they' d absolutely love it, and it was such a nice gesture\nhis feet were no longer an issue as I laughed it off and even made a joke\nto the comedian about getting a pedicure before hitting L.A' s beaches.\nThe flight was only short and we arrived in busy L.A within the hour,\nsaying Good -Bye to Matt, who was a pleasure to meet. Jeffrey had a\nmeeting at a production studio for one of the girls he was keeping lured in\nhis grasps, so we were off yet again for more business. We were staying\nwith one of his old girlfriends, Jeffrey' s code for \" She got to old for my\ntaste, but was still nice enough to keep around\". She was a tall blonde\nwith blue eyes, a stereotypical Barbie doll. In her younger years she had\nbeen a successful model and now lived on the beaches of Santa Monica\nwith a sweeping view of the oceans landscape as her backyard.\nThe next morning Jeffrey and I went out to breakfast. He said Sarah\nKeller, would be joining us with another one of Jeffrey' s girls I hadn' t\nmet yet, her name was Nadia Bjorlin and she was a Yugoslavian model\nturned aspiring actress, with the help of Jeffrey, as he so proudly\nremarked at the table before they arrived shortly thereafter. She was a\nstunning brunette with olive skin tones and shocking blue eyes. By far\none of the most beautiful girls I had ever met before. She and Sarah\napproached the table, shopping bags in hands already in the early hours of\nthe day. They both pulled out a chair and showed us their new pair of\nJimmy Choo' s they had bought on their way here this morning, and\nexcitedly asked for Jeffrey' s opinion.. He loved the doting attention and\nanyone who could make him feel important. We all went back to Sarah' s\napartment that Jeffrey rented for her on Malibu Beach. This was the first\ntime Jeffrey came to visit and when we got there you could see why. It\nwas a tiny one -bedroom shack, too small for his likes of accommodation,\nbut she loved it and it was plain to see why, the waves lapped underneath\nher porch twice a day, what else could anyone want. Before even walking\nthrough her door, you could hear the commotion of excitedly screaming\nfemales voices coming from inside. There were about five other girls in\nSarah' s living room and she had invited them so Jeffrey could have a few\ndifferent girls to choose from. Jeffrey looked at Sarah and smiled, aren' t\nyou sweet, as all the girls rushed to introduce themselves, hoping for the\nopportunities Sarah had offered them to come in the first place.\nWe all had some coffee and biscuits while the conversation kept getting\nlouder and louder, every girl trying to talk over the next one. Jeffrey\ncould handle only so much of that before getting too annoyed. Instead of\nchoosing one of the other new girls, Jeffrey wanted Sarah to show Nadia\nand I into her bedroom. He was anticipating the introduction of his two\nfavorite girls together, what mischief he had hoped we would get up to\nwas apparent when he asked where Sarah had kept her play toys and not\nthe fisher price ones. Sarah brought out quite a collection of her personal\ntoys and was giggling on her way out as she shut the door. Suddenly the\nroom behind us went quiet, probably hoping to catch a moan or groans\ntoo laugh at and I felt so degraded having everyone knowing exactly what\nwas going on. Knowing my duties well I was baffled this time as there\nwas no ritualistic massage wanted_ He immediately instructed us to start\nkissing and fondling each other with the provided toys straight away\nseeing his excitement grow watching us try and out do the other one with\npleasure, he couldn' t keep restraint any longer and started to have\nintercourse with the both of us, taking his erect penis out of the other to\nonly swap to the other girl, back and forth. This continued for a good\nfifteen minutes or so while we continued to engage in lesbian acts on\neach other while the other girl was being subdued by Jeffrey' s thrust' s of\npenetration. Nadia wasjust as dutiful as I was in fulfilling his demented\nrequests, willing to lend her body to Jeffrey and those he sent her too, for\nthe sake of keeping her acting career and putting on a good act at that.\nShe was never competition though. Once I found out where she actually\ncame from I took pity on her for the similar life of servitude we were both\naccustomed too and not that we ever became good friends but we had\nreason to relate to each other.\nLater on Jeffrey, Nadia and I went to a production studio in L.A, where\nwe had to meet with Nadia' s agent as well as the producer of \"Day' s Of\nOur Lives\". The meeting lasted five minutes, with everyone in consent to\nthe proposal. We flew all the way out there to talk about money, only to\nbe leaving that evening back to N. Y.C. On the way to the airport we\n53\n54\nCopyright Protected Material\nCopyright Protested Material\nCONFIDENTIAL OIUFFRE004186 CONFIDENTIAL OIUFFRL004187\nstopped at a fifties looking diner and got a cheeseburger and vanilla\nmilkshake, the first and only time I saw Jeffrey eat what I considered to\nbe real food. Seven lanes to drive in and the freeway was still lined\nbumper to bumper in the heavy rain. The sound of downpour on the\nrooftop of the taxi and the rhythm of the windshield wipers was making\nme sleepy. I was looking forward to sleeping through the long flight\nback. Thank goodness we had a private jet to catch back, the trip would\nbe comfortable and not rushed to get there on time through the daily peak\nhour traffic. Jeffrey asked me what I thought of Nadia, more of a kiss and\ntell kind of thing for him, so proud to admit some of his tenacious acts of\npedophilia to me that I knew most people would be embarrassed to even\nthink aloud but I said what he wanted to hear when he asked me what I\nhad thought of her on the way back. I replied, \" She is attractive, funny,\nand seems to know what she is doing with you\" Laughing at my\nstatement, he then started to tell me the history behind where he got her.\nFive years ago when she was merely a teenager just turned thirteen. Her\nfather had recently passed away, leaving Nadia' s mother in a tremendous\namount of debt and living in a third world country, she didn' t have the\nmeans necessary to raise her own daughter. When Ghislane approached\nNadia for the first time at a music school, she seemed like a maternal,\ncaring stepmother. Telling Nadia' s mother if she let Nadia go with her,\nshe would se to it personally that Nadia receive the best education and\nchances in life to make it. In her customs it wasn' t odd for a young girl to\nbe married off to bring the family good fortune, so she kissed her baby\ngirl good- bye and sent her off to commence her life of servitude. I sat\nthere speechless listening to Jeffrey brag about his endeavor to get her\nover here, shocked that he could stoop as low to use a barely teen to\noblige his sexual desires. He was laughing and giddy as he replayed the\nmemories of her arrival over in his head, painting me a horrific picture I\nhad no choice but to imitate a smile to face him with.\nNo pretty girl is safe from the allurement of these villains procuring the\nyouth off of every street in the world. I knew that day more than ever\nbefore those morals did not exist for people like this. Jeffrey once told me\nthat every girl he has had sexual relations with has benefited in their\ncareer, finances, or an achievement in marriage with a successful\ncolleague of his. Mine was the massage career, ever so often still giving\nme a lesson from a professional, which kept me quiet for a while longer.\nI thought I was already knee deep in this world, if I gave up after putting\nmyself through all of this hell it would' ve all been be for nothing. So I\ntreaded lightly, constantly at a risk of being replaced by another willing\nparticipant and playing the eager student he wanted me to be.\nChapter 9\nWe met Ghislane and Emmy in N. Y. C, and it wasn' t a blissful reunion\nas I hoped for, wanting a break from all of this I was just looking forward\nto getting back to Palm Beach, not leaving for a further four more days. I\ngot home late in the evening as Jeffrey invited me out to the movies atter\nwe had relaxed at his house for a while after landing.\nI put my keys through the door to my apartment and walked in to a\nquiet house. Not thinking anyone was at home I set my suitcase on the\nfloor and put my cell phone on charge as I always did to be accessible for\nwhenever Jeffrey or Ghislane could call. I went to get a drink out of the\nfridge when I heard some noises coming from the back of my apartment\nwhere my bedroom was. I started back there and slowly turned my\ndoorknob to reveal T.J on top of another girl. When they noticed they\nweren' t alone anymore, T. J got off her with promptness. I recognized the\ngirl from seeing her around at parties, and she was the town lowie,\nscattering her trail of guys along with her presumable diseases, and I\nwasn' t shy to verbalize that when she tried to open her mouth and calm\nthe heated situation between T.J and I. She didn' t like her cards on the\ntable in front of the guy she was screwing around with and got up in a fit\nof rage to attack me. Still nude with only my new white sheets to cover\nher body, I threw her out of my house along with T. J. \" I have been\npaying your way for months, only finding out your sleeping with the\nbiggest slut in Royal Palm Beach, at least have some dignity and higher\nyour standards\" I didn' t really have a leg to stand on since I had started\nthis relationship giving him the knowledge I had a sugar daddy to answer\nto above him. \" You' re gone all the time and with that old man, what did\nyou expect me to do\"? He was right, I wanted what I couldn' t have, but I\nneeded some time to cool down and accept my situation. I loved having\nT. J around to come home too, and he used to be my best friend in my\nschool days. I convinced myself of the lies I continued to accept.\nDays later I was still not speaking with T.J, mentally adjusting to my\ncircumstances, I thought I' d have the day off to relax since I hadn' t been\ncalled all day. Until about five pm when Ghislane called and said Jeffrey\nwould like a massage in an hour. Grudgingly l got up from relaxing on\nthe couch, got dressed and put my make-up on, meeting Juan downstairs\na half an hour later. Jeffrey was already lying on the massage table when\nI walked in. I started the massage being very quiet from my somber\nmood, when Jeffrey picked up on it and said \" you know it' s not good to\nmassage people when you' re angry, you could pass on negative energy\".\nI wasn' t sure if he was serious or just trying to be nice so I could speak\nabout what was bothering me. Ending up not being able to contain my\n55\n56\nL Copyright Proroowd Mammal\nCopyright P—\nCONFIDEWLm L GIUFFRE004188 CONFIUE'N I1AL GIL1 RE004189\naed Motorial\nemotion any further I told him what happened with T.J and broke down\nin tears, a little heart broken from living in such a lie. He turned around\nfrom his massage and sincerely paused for a second thinking he was\ngoing to console me but instead he laughed at the very prospect of my\nnotion that monogamous relationships ever existed. \" Are you serious, he\nwas only doing what every guy in the world does, you can' t hold that\nagainst him\". I replied in a lighthearted gesture \" whose side are you on\nanyways\"? His answer stuck with me for many years to come \" I' m on\nyour side which is why I' m going to save you a lot of grief with this one\ntip, Never expect a man to be faithful and you' ll never be let down, it' s\njust the way us men are genetically imprinted.\" The remainder of the\nmassage I had to pretend like I wasn' t further saddened by his response,\nbut in fact having to act enlightened. I would never come to him for any\nother relationship advice, ever again. He told me I' d be fine if I just\nlistened to my mentor. He still loved role-playing the teacher and me the\npupil, like the old days before he got rich and only used to be a college\nprofessor. I finished the massage and fulfilled my sexual duties before\nbeing sent home wanting to collapse in anguish.\nT.J was outside my apartment door when I got there, his mom waiting\ndownstairs in her minivan just in case I kicked hint out again. He pleaded\nhis guilt and promised that he would never see her again, agreeing with\nme that she was the town slut and he screwed up big time. I let hiuia back\ninto my apartment and back into my life for that matter but more aware of\nthe world I was being led into believing was of normal conduct accepted\nby everyone in this sick world. Jeffrey was going back to N.Y.0 and told\nme to have a few days off before his assistant at his office would arrange\nan E -Ticket on a commercial flight for me to join him later in the week. I\nhad just made loads of money from my previous trip and wanted to relax\nlike any teenager does, so I threw a hotel party that weekend on Singer\nIsland in Rivera Beach, inviting only a small group of friends to begin\nwith.\nThe hotel room quickly filled up with a flood of teens and the pumping\nmusic was blaring. The room had a balcony overlooking the pool and the\nbeach that became the smoker' s section. I wasn' t a real smoker at that\npoint, preferring to have a puff of a spiffed blunt instead so I made it my\nrule to go outside trying to prevent holes in the carpet, but it didn' t last\ntoo long when our forbidden walls came tumbling down. Making so\nmuch money that I could supply my wild parties with an assortment of\ndrugs like trips, ecstasy, and coke as well as an abundance of alcohol, that\nT. J had all the contacts for, made my fellow teens admire me. It definitely\ngave me a head swell, thinking here I was so young but so grown up\nalready with all of my peers from high school looking up to me. In the\nwee hours of the morning we were all still going hard with our eyes\ndilated into little black diamonds. We were all having in depth\nconversations about life and where we would all end up when this\ncharade was all said done. Nobody got to sleep that night as the room\nslowly dwindled in numbers as people were finding their way home to\nrecover from the repercussions of drugs wearing down out of their\nintoxicated system.\nWhen I flew out to N.Y.0 to meet Jeffrey the next day, 1 was still in a\nhorrible state. Not knowing what was wrong with me, thinking it was just\na bad come down, I rushed out of the elevator and down the hall to my\nroom, sweating profusely, to make it just in time to the toilet to throw up\nbile again for the uncountable time since getting off the plane. I was\nhaving intense cramps in my stomach and when 1 was called down to\nmeet Jeffrey in the massage room, I had to decline for the first time. I told\nthe housekeeper that 1 was feeling very ill after the flight, maybe some off\nfood for lunch and needed to lie down for a while. Nobody came up to\ncheck on me for hours or even called. Waking up from my much- needed\nnap, I pulled back the expensive white sheets to find myself in a pool of\nmy own sweat and blood. I was covered in the red stains that drenched\nthe pants I was wearing. I had no idea what was going on, I could only\nfocus on the dire amount of pain I was in. In between the heaves of\nthrowing up and crying simultaneously I was able to reach the phone and\ncalled the housemaid on the intercom. I told her 1 needed to go to a\nhospital immediately and slammed the phone down only to fall back to\nthe floor hurdled in a ball. She didn' t hesitate in calling Ghislane who ran\nup to see what was wrong. Ghislane then called Jeffrey who was in his\noffice at the time and told him to hurry up to my level, stressing to him\nthat it was an emergency. Thinking they really cared about me for the\nfirst time since I had known them, they came with me to the hospital with\nme. Now I realize I was only a liability in getting them caught and they\nneeded to get to the doctors before I could say anything incriminating.\nThey were suspecting the worst now and seeing he never wore a condom\nwith me and from our previous conversations they knew I always made\nT.J wear one, they feared the situation at hand.\nWhen he saw the catastrophic state I was in at that point, it was the\nhousemaid who helped me get up and assisted me down to the car where\nJo -Jo was waiting for me. He drove us to either Lennox Hill Hospital or\nMount Sinai, I can' t remember, as it was so blurry in such a bad\ncondition. Rushed in for immediate testing 1 was uncontrollably vomiting\nand in so much agony, I was given an injection to help me to subside the\nintense pain. A nurse came in to ask who would pay for this and although\nI insisted my parents insurance still covered me, Jeffrey persisted that he\ntake care of all the medical bills and gave the nurse his information.\n57\n58\nC Copyright Protected Material -\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDEN [ AL GILJFFRE004190 CONFIDENTIAL GI 1FFRE004191\nWhen the pain relief kicked in, everything and everyone dwindled\naway until I felt like Alice in Wonderland who just swallowed the\nshrinking tablet and everyone standing around me seemed to move so\nquick, speak so loud and hover above me. When I awoke from my\ninduced state, I was alone in a different room. Not knowing at all what\nwent on but feeling a little better, I called in the nurse who looked\nthrough my charts and checked my vital signs. Then told me the doctor\nwould be in shortly to inform me of the conclusion to my illness.\nHe was a tall man with dark hair, and a hardened look about him\nobviously from his job and constantly seeing the worst horror stories man\ncould think of, he just bluntly told me I had miscarried in early stages of\npregnancy. I should be fine to go home as soon as my course of\nintravenous antibiotics was complete. The news sunk in fast and hit a\ndeep nerve. I waited for the doctor to close the curtain before I let out any\nemotion and cried for my disastrous lifestyle that was dragging me into a\nworld that I wanted to break out of. This reoccurring cycle of believing I\nneeded men like Jeffrey to succeed in my life was draining the last bits of\nsensitivity left in my heart. I was picked up by Jeffrey himself who took\nthe doctor alone to the side of the busy hallway to have a private\nconversation about something. Jeffrey wasn' t comforting at all, instead he\nsent me back home to rest for a couple weeks, and I only fell deeper into\na depression, using all forms of self-medication to treat my sorrows.\nTwo weeks later, as if Jeffrey was trying to lighten my spirits, he told\nme I would be going to his island to meet a new client_ He is a Harvard\nProfessor, named Stephen Kosslyn. I would be spending two days with\nhim showing him around the island, dining with him, and treating him to\na massage whenever he wanted. Without Jeffrey even verbalizing the\nneed to have sex with him, he told me to keep him happy like I had my\nfirst client. 1 packed my suitcase with island apparel, and kissed T. J goodbye,\nwho had at least offered me a warm embrace upon the news of my\nmiscarriage but none other than that knowing it wasn' t his.\nStephen was a quirky little man with white hair and a mad scientist look\nabout him. We arrived separately and I greeted him when one of the\nhousekeepers picked him up from the airport and arrived by boat, instead\nof helicopter as Jeffrey and Ghislane often arrive on. We made our\nacquaintances and he looked as if he was tripping over himself with\nwords, obviously delighted with his company and location for the\nweekend. I showed him around as Jeffrey had asked and took him on an\nadventurous quad bike ride around the small curvy paths, leading the way\nand letting loose my hair, doing something that gave me a natural high\ninstead of the prescription one. The sights alone were breathtaking from\nthe mountainous peaks of the untouched parts of the island, we sat at a\ncliff and just sat there, not saying a word to each other besides to\ncompliment the sights mother nature that appealed to us. I didn' t feel as if\nI owed this stranger anything but what was expected of me by Jeffrey and\nI could be polite, I just couldn' t be myself.\nWe got back to the main villa to see what time dinner would be served\nso we could have time to unpack and clean up beforehand. We both met\nat six pm for dinner on the outside veranda. He sat at the head of the\ntable and I sat next to him, politely folding my napkin to put in my lap.\nThe first time Jeffrey and Ghislane had seen me cut meat and eat with a\nfork and knife they were so appalled, making fun of my unsophisticated\nhabits. Ghislane took the fork and knife in her hands and proceeded to\nshow me how to politely cut my food and eat. Now that my mannerisms\nhad improved they wouldn' t have to be worried about my etiquette when\nsomeone important was around anyone. We both drank the red wine\nsupplied on the table and it seemed to warm me up on the breezy night.\nBy the time dinner was served and another red wine bottle later, he\nseemed to get funnier. I made fun of his tousled hair and he poked at me\nfor my skinny legs, calling me a wanna- be- anorexic. When dessert was\nbrought out, he asked if he could receive one of the delightful massages\nhe has been hearing about from Jeffrey. I gulped more red wine down and\nsweetly complied with his offer, dreading the moment I' d have to see his\nnaked body, let alone touch it. I asked the housekeeper Kathy that had\nbeen serving us that night to please have someone set up a massage bed\nin one of the cabana' s. I went to my room to down a few Xanax, telling\nhim I wanted to freshen up after dinner but to meet me in his cabana in\ntwenty minutes or so. I was ready to go as I had said, twenty minutes\nlater, with the effects of the tablets mixed with the red wine, and I would\nbe free not to feel anything. He was still dressed when I got in the cabana,\nobviously not accustomed to this and a lot shyer than what 1 had been\nused to, I told him he' d need to undress and lie face down on the table,\nputting a towel to cover his bare bottom to prevent him feeling\nembarrassed during the massage. I gave the massage my earnest as I\nalways had, and quickly got through having intercourse with him. Not\nwanting to make any foreplay or anything extravagant out of it, 1 let him\nthink that' s as good as it got, and by the smile on his face, I thought I had\ndone enough.\nThe next day I took him down to the beach for a real massage under a\ntiki-hut on the waters edge. It was one of Jeffrey' s favorite places to have\na massage, as he droned out to the sound of the waves and my gentle\ntherapeutic strokes. Afterwards we had lunch back at the main villa and\nwent back down to the beach to swim out to the water trampoline about\none hundred meters off the dock. He didn' t do any bouncing around or\nanything like that. It was just a good base point for a rest spot after a long\n59\n60\n1 Copyright Protoetcd Material Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004192 CONFIDENTIAL - GIUFFRE004193\nswim. What was really cool about it though, was you could see through\nthe mesh and watch fish swimming underneath.\nThe rest of the afternoon we spent by the pool reading magazines and\neating fruit plates. Eventually lie went to his cabana to have a nap later\non. That night after dinner and my mixed cocktail of Xanax and red wine,\nI asked if he' d like another massage before I went to bed. He just wanted\nto stay up watching movies in Jeffrey' s theatre room. As peculiar as that\nrequest was to me I didn' t argue it, I just hoped I hadn' t disappointed him\nin any way that could make it back to Jeffrey. I showed him how to use\nthe remote and turn off the T. V when he was finished before going to\nbed. The next morning we were both catching a flight from St. Thomas\nand we had no time for anything other than breakfast and packing, which\nsaved me from having to be too polite as we said our good-bye' s from the\nterminal in the airport, both hurriedly off in separate directions,\nthankfully. I arrived back in Palm Beach, only to be told to catch another\nflight the next day to N. Y.C, where Jeffrey would fix me up the money he\nowed me for treating his colleague out to an entertaining weekend.\nChapter 10\nI was fixed up more than what I had usually made for two days, which\nwas great because that car I had been saving for was finally within my\nreach. I had been waiting for the freedom a car gives every teenager for a\nlong time, and now that I had over fifteen thousand dollars saved up I\ncould pretty much afford to go buy myself a nice car outright. Looking\nmuch better than the last time I saw him Jeffrey acknowledged it. I went\nto his office where he was waiting for me and he had a guest with him.\nShe was unusual looking to the common stereotype drop dead gorgeous\ngirls Jeffrey had normally introduced me to. Of Asian decent, her name\nwas Rena. Jeffrey had met her at an art gallery where some of her own\nartwork was on display. She had a bubbly persona about her and I could\nthen understand why Jeffrey liked her so much, she fit into the\nsubservient category that he liked his girls to fall under. It was apparent\nto me that they had already slept together in the short time span they had\nmet, as there closeness was oddly noticeable and I wondered what it was\nhe was offering to her in exchange for her body. I found out later from\nJeffrey that he was buying her artwork, promising her the world as an\nartist, telling her he' d have her work in the all the museums in N.Y.0 and\nthe best art exhibits. Everyone was promised something, and seemed to\nbe bought off in someway or another to be in his company. It was only a\nmatter of time that the truth would come out.\nTo my own amazement Rena was to be assisting me in Jeffrey' s\nmassage this day, not being a total knockout or anything spectacular,\nlooks wise that is, but for some reason he seemed intrigued enough. As\nwe made our way through his spectacular mansion she was in total awe at\nevery corner. Commenting on the present artwork and decor that we\npassed in every hall, it no longer seemed so grandeur to me anymore but\nhearing someone else speak about it in such excitement reminded me of\nthe days when all of this seemed so unforeseen.\nWhen we got to the massage room, or \" The Dungeon\" as 1 used to put\nit for it' s medieval looking appearance, we firstly out of custom all had a\nsteam shower, where Jeffrey expected me to walk her through a servants\nduties, telling her to take his other foot and start rubbing in small circles\nand stroking the arches of his foot rhythmically. Rena took the\ninstructions well and began to massage him too. When we all went to the\nshower next and she followed in my exact lead washing his body as well.\nJeffrey absolutely loved the fact that two teenage girls were dually\npampering him. Jeffrey wanted to move to the massage bed and 1 had to\nfurther begin to show her about the body, upon his accord. She mimicked\nmy every move up his legs and buttocks, keeping up with every stroke\nuntil he could not contain his arousal any longer and was already\nrequesting us to start kissing each other, the start of the very reason we\nhad even met in the first place.\nHe blatantly stopped the massage nowhere near being complete and\nturned over to announce his increased arousal in a physical abundance of\ngrotesqueness. Moving over to the small couch in the corner of the room\nhe made a space for her to lye me down on the massage table as she had\ncommanded him to do in such a domineering tone that he wasn' t used to\nbeing spoken down to with. From that very moment onwards and from\nthe look on his face he was yearning for her to orchestrate an hour of\ndeliverance upon my meek nature. He started to stroke his erect manhood\nas he was being tantalized watching her take over every inch of my body\nin a dominating act of seduction. I was left breathless and soar after my\nfirst introduction into the world of S& M.\nRena considered herself a dominatrix, she loved bondage, whipping\nhitting, and eventually cutting her sex partner with little sharp knives\nuntil they subdued to her punishment in agonizing pain. She was\nabsolutely crazy if you were to ask me, and I couldn' t help but wonder\nwhat got her into this in the first place. All I knew was that Jeffrey was\nabsurdly taking into the appeal of watching us two interact, often with her\nacting as my mistress who would fondle me with an insurmountable\namount of whips and toys. Then she would love to finish off every\nsession by hitting me across my face with a hard blow from the back of\nher hand and sneering over my curled up body showing Jeffrey her ability\n61\n62\nJ Copyright Protected Material\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004194 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004195\nto make others surrender to her extreme force. She could be so opposite\nall of the sudden and be tenderly intimate with Jeffrey stroking his penis\nlovingly and even speaking in baby talk to him, which he seemed to\nadore.\nHe loved us pairing up so much that within months he made Rena an\nofficial even renting her an apartment at the same place he had one for me\nduring my extensive trips out to N. Y. C. Sending us out shopping together\nat all of the underground seedy sex stores downtown we would bring him\nback thousands of dollars worth of sexy outfits, sex toys and bondage\nmaterial. His favorite one was a black leather studded collar that lead\ndown the back of my spine to cuff my hands and feet together, offering\nRena the most compromising positions to wield her afflictions, one she\nwas excited to pick out for my usage.\nShe was good at eradicating my softer side though. Helping me forge\nan unpredictable scenario of me turning the tables on her, making her at\nmy will instead of me always being at her twisted discretion. Jeffrey\nloved the rivalry between us, both striving to dominate the other one but\nto me it was just another way of surviving her punishment. All for show I\nthought she was a madman let loose in a torturesome domain of violent\nsex and unbearable beatings. I wasn' t sure how long I could hold off this\ncharade of S & M, I just didn' t want Jeffrey to think I couldn' t give him\neverything that she could, always being replaceable in his company.\nShe and I could often come across as good friends to his blind eye but\nit was only a matter of time before the animosity inside of me was going\nto snap. Doing normal things too made it all half bearable. Having a lot of\nsimilar interests we did fun things like go to the theatre to watch\nPhantom of the Opera\" or visit several historical and art museums\ntogether, afterwards treating ourselves for a giant piece of greasy N.Y.0\nstyle pizza. Like I said, we really liked each other purely as friends but\nthe dominance in the massage chambers was taking it' s toll on our\nstrange friendship. One average trip back to N. Y.C, she surprised Jeffrey\nwith a six foot by six- foot oil painting of her and I lying nude in a ying\nand yang position facing each other. Although we were soliciting each\nother with sexual innuendo the picture was still very carefully\norchestrated to perfectly portray the darker side of Jeffrey' s thrills. It was\nan amazing piece of work, besides the lewdness of it, but she would' ve\nknown that' s exactly what kind of art Jeffrey liked. He was so astounded\nby her gift as he had previously asked her to construct a small painting of\nus together but was not expecting anything of this grand magnitude she\nhad presented him with. He lifted her from the ground and twirled her\naround before he thanked her profusely and embellished her with his\nprofound gratitude, the only thing Jeffrey had to offer, he handed her a\nsmall wad of cash as her payment. It was the most appreciation I had ever\nseen him show a girl. Obviously moved by her gesture, he got her an\nexhibit in N.Y.C' s \" Metropolitan Museum of Art\" where she submitted\nher very own piece. She sculpted an image of my headshot out of clay,\nshaping it with the strands of my long hair blowing across my face. I was\ntaken aback myself at her creation. She really did have an amazing talent\nif not for her meaner streak she won! d' ve beer. ^ great friend I vVil! never\nforget Rena, for all of the ups and the downs we endured together.\nIt wasn' t too much longer before I finally had enough of the abuse in\nthe bedroom and I had to tell Jeffrey what 1 was feeling. She was getting\neven more violent as time went on, and with her questioning me and\nJeffrey why she didn' t get brought on long trips with him, she didn' t get\nthe fact that she was just a tool for him to use. Jeffrey said he was already\nthinking about getting rid of her off of his \" regular list\". He said she was\nbecoming too clingy and he didn' t like clinginess or jealousy. I never\neven got to say good-bye or take the opportunity to keep her as a friend,\nlike a girlfriend to catch up with once and awhile, but that' s how it was\nwith Jeffrey, one day you sat under the blanket of his comfortably and the\nnext without any warning you could be discarded like yesterdays news.\nShe would' ve taken it hard but that' s the game we were playing and it\nwas for those who knew what lines not to cross.\nI was further surprised the next day when Jeffrey gave me a thousand\ndollars to go shopping in downtown Manhattan to find a classy dress, on\ntop of being sent to the exclusive beauty salon of celebrity stylist\nFrederic Fekkai\" for a new look. It was amazing, to be pampered like\nroyalty. I walked out of there feeling like I had replaced a young girl with\na young woman, I felt beautiful. He had yet another surprise in store for\nme. Ghislane called me and told me 1 need to go to a photo -developing\nstore and ask them for two LD photos then bring them downtown to\nJeffrey' s Manhattan office. Weird request I thought. 1 was more used to\nposing in full body shots being sexually exposed as a gift for Jeffrey. I\ndid as they asked and took my two photos into the office where Jeffrey' s\nassistant was waiting for my arrival. Still not telling me what the\nheadshots were for, she took them from me and told me to have a seat for\na second. A moment later I heard Jeffrey call me into the office. \" I like\nwhat you' ve done with your hair, you' ve gone more blonde, suits your\nglowing tan\". I replied with an appreciative \" thank -you\" for sending me\nto such a renowned hairstylist, and shopping money. I showed him my\nfinds for the day, an elegant off the shoulder navy blue dress that had two\nlayers that would swoosh and sway with my every stride. I couldn' t wait\nto wear it on a special occasion, and I wouldn' t have to. The pictures I\nhad to bring to him, as he would proceed to tell me, were for my first\npassport. I was so excited, we were going to France for a close friend of\nJeffrey and Ghislane' s birthday party, famed super -model Naomi\n63\n64\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\nCopyright Protooted Material\nGIUFFRE004196 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRL'004197\nCampbell. I was so over-joyed with excitement, what girl my age with a\nbackground like mine was attending socialite parties and globetrotting the\nworld. It only made it harder for me to see beyond the elusive walls I had\nput up to protect myself from the appalling truth.\nWe left in early April first going to London, Paris and then our final\ndestination being St. Tropez in Southern France. If Hallmark had a\npostcard, St. Tropez would definitely be on the front of it. It was beautiful\nspring weather and every where you looked women were dressed in\nbikini tops branded with some kind of designer label embedded into it\nand the men were following them around like harping dogs in heat. In all\nof the elegance of the Mediterranean, \" La Bastide De St. Tropez\" was an\nimpressive landmark. Jeffrey and Ghislane were staying in one of the\nprivate cottages, on the park on the grounds, while Emmy and I stayed in\nseparate quarters inside the hotel. The old style cobblestone streets were\nlined with boutique shops and beauty parlors_ It was the hedonistic\nstomping grounds of the beyond rich and famous.\nThe next day we went out to lunch at the grand opening of the\ninfamous Nikki Beach Club, where a cheap glass of champagne costs\naround two hundred dollars and if your not keeping the alcohol\nconsumption flowing like water, you' d be asked to leave to make way for\nthe constant flow of prospectus patrons. That' s where I first got to meet\nNaomi Campbell. She was wearing the typical attire strutting around\nsouthern France, a D& G bikini top and a wrap around mini skirt to go\nover the swimsuits bikini. She was so tall and stunningly beautiful. Her\ncharisma was energetic, funny, and everyone seemed to hang off of her\nevery word and laugh at her every joke. Ghislane and Jeffrey kissed her\ncheeks and wished her a happy birthday, and then I was introduced and\nfollowed in their suit. She was surrounded by a league of assistants,\nfriends and fans, which didn' t make it easy for us to all converse but she\ngot enough time in to invite us abroad a yacht of a fellow she was \" kind\nof seeing\" at the time for the before party ahead of tonight' s event. We\nwent back to the hotel and I gave Jeffrey a massage in his room before we\nall headed down to the pool to soak in some of the year' s first sun' s rays.\nI loved wearing my new ball gown and feeling like a princess. It was\nabsolutely sensational and made me feel as if I floated in the dress. I\nswept up my long hair in a twisted clip, only letting down a few curly\nstrands and layered on the mascara. Receiving many compliments\nthroughout the evening when we eventually left the Yacht to make our\nappearance at the main birthday bash, I couldn' t help but feel excitement\nfor the party to come it was the first celebrity birthday bash I had ever\nbeen to. Being introduced to model after model and the rich men that\nfollowed them around became dizzying. Jeffrey sat back and watched as I\nbuoyantly worked the dance floor, coming back to the table where he\nwas, only to grab another glass of champagne every now and then. Every\nso often he' d introduce to me to someone new, pulling me aside to show\noff his eager young masseuse to his fellow pedo' s. These people had so\nmuch money pouring out of them. I don' t know why he even thought\nthey' d care in the first place. It made me feel good though. At least I\nknew I made him proud to have me in his company.\nBeing surrounded by so many of Jeffrey' s colleagues and his\nlikeminded people that were considered the most sophisticated and the\nhighly esteemed of today' s world nearly made the way I was living lately\nmore fathomable, at least to myself. I thought if everyone looks up to\nthese people and they are all accepting of it, it must be just the way the\nworld turns. I danced with a young prince that night and with all of the\nhelp from the bubbly champagne I couldn' t remember his name for the\nlife of me. On one of my trips back to the table for another glass, Jeffrey\nleaned over to quietly whisper in my ear that it was a prince that I had\nactually been dancing with and I didn' t phase me in the least way. I went\nback to the dance floor and continued to let my hair down. It was a fun\nbash, the entire crowd sang \" Happy Birthday\" to Naomi and by the time\nwe got back in the car to retreat for the night, I was giddy from the\ndrinking and dancing all evening. We had a guest in the car, and\napparently we had already been introduced, but I couldn' t even remember\nhis name in the first five minutes of our meeting again. He was the hotel\nowner of some large chain in America called \" Hilton\". Staying at one of\nthe cottages near Jeffrey, he saw it quaint to loan me out for a night' s\nmassage to ruin an \" almost\" perfect evening. Jeffrey told me to come\nback to his room after I was finished with Rick, thankfully he reminded\nme of his name but also odd I thought, being so late I would' ve never\nimagined Jeffrey could stay up this late but I never made a fuss out of his\nrequests. I gave him affirmation of my understood instructions and\nheaded off with this stranger into the darkness.\nI dimmed the bright lights in his bedroom to a softer tone as if it might\naid the vision of this short, balding man with straggling remnants of curly\nbrown hair left to show for the remaining bits of youth left in him. I had\nto ask him to undress and lay on top of the towel that I had picked up\nfrom the neatly folded pile at the end of his bed and spread it over the\nduvet. I didn' t want to waste a second in his place, getting right to the\nvery reason I was even there. Turning around while he was getting\nundressed, being our first time together, I wanted to give him the\nimpression I was actually a therapist and not a finale to the end of the\nnights entertainment. Not exactly what he had in mind though, given that\nmy impression was already made for me when Jeffrey arranged for our\nmeeting in the first place. His chuckle to my response was condescending\nas he came up behind me and unzipped my dress which floated to the\n65\n66\nI:'.\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDLWIAL\nCopyright Pmtactcd Material\nGIUFFRE004198 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004199\nbottom of the floor as he was saying \" You can' t really expect to give a\nmassage wearing this, here sweetie, I' ll help you out of it.\" He just\nwanted to see the hidden bounty my clothes were hindering his eyes from\nseeing. I just went about my way trying to get his hands off of me and to\nget him to lie down for a massage. Making quaint conversation with him\nwas pointless as I was trying to send his thoughts elsewhere other than\nthe apparent perverted schemes replaying in his mind from the heavy\nbreathing he was making and the looks he was giving to me. I was using\nall of the tricks in the \" tum -off' book even asking him about his wife and\nkids.\nUnquestionably he was in seventh heaven turning every one of my\ndistractions into another flattering compliment. He was saying things like\nI love what you do you to me, I have never felt like this before, come\nstay with me and I will pay you double, no, triple whatever Jeffrey pays\nyou!\" Knowing he was just a drunk idiot, I wasn' t being lured in by any\nof his offers of money or a privileged lifestyle, I knew these cages all too\nwell and I was better off sticking with the one that I was at least\naccustomed to already. Holding back any composure now, he was going\nextremely wild ravishing at my body trying to tear off my panties like a\nhungered wild animal. After all of the champagne I had drunk that night\nit gave me the nerve that I needed to know exactly how to handle perverts\nlike this one, who had been no different from every other shmuck in my\nlife, and 1 quickly shut him up with a blowjob lasting no longer than two\nterrible minutes. It had only been shy of a half an hour before 1 was\nalready getting quickly get dressed and hurrying out his cottage door.\nWhen I got to Jeffrey' s cottage I rushed through the door and told\nJeffrey and Ghislane, who were sitting front of the fireplace reading a\nbooks, that I never ever wanted to see that guy ever again. When they\nasked me what was the matter, 1 told them of every thing that had\nhappened that night even how he offered me to come work for him\ngetting paid triple. I established a lot of trust with Jeffrey that night. He\nasked me why I didn' t accept the offer and I responded with \" Who\nwould look after you, if I were gone?\" Like a caring grand father would\ndo, he pulled me into his chest for a hug and told me that it meant a lot to\nhim. It was so late and I was so tired but I still had to give Jeffrey his\nmassage that night. He asked me to just rub his feet as he fell asleep, and\nthankfully he was out like a light in no time. The next morning I took two\nheadache tablets and a ginger ale instead of a coffee. Trying to contain\nmy hangover as best as possible behind a pair of sunnies it was mid\nafternoon by the time I had felt like myself again. We spent the day Yacht\nhopping, soaking in the sunny weather while Jeffrey and Ghislane caught\nup with old acquaintances, Emmy and I were just accessories to look\ngood on the arms of them. The next day we wrapped up the tail end of\nour trip and commenced our flight back into the U. S. I was paid a\ngenerous amount and set off to go car shopping as soon as I got back to\nFlorida. Through a private seller, I was able to pay out right for my car. I\ngot a Dodge Dakota in cherry red, and immediately had an impressive\nsound system put in. She was my first pride and joy and taste of freedom.\nI would love to drive her down to Lakeworth Beach to sit in my car and\nwatch the waves while I listened to my stereo blare music and puffed on a\njay. Letting the rest of the world pass by while I sat back and watched\nthem walk past wondering to myself what their story was about.\n1 turned seventeen that summer and had accumulated a string of exotic\ndestinations that I had travelled in such a short time. 1 was given more\nmake-up and a pair of diamond earrings from Jeffrey. Ghislane only\nwished me a happy day, wondering at times if she felt threatened by\nJeffrey' s and my closeness. We went to the island after we left N. Y.0 and\nI asked If Sarah would be meeting us, mentioning it had been a while\nsince we had last seen her. He said he had some bad news about her.\nExpecting the worse, thinking she had gotten hurt or something, I was\nastounded when Jeffrey told me that she had been sent to his island with\none of his friends for a couple days and when the housekeepers were\ncleaning her room and they found a stash of cocaine left out carelessly in\nthe bathroom.\nHe said he had no choice but to let her go. Addicts with no respect for\nthemselves or his wishes had no leeway in Jeffrey' s book. He didn' t mind\nthat I dabbled in drugs once in a while as long as I never brought them\nalong with us on any trips, except for my Xanax, which he didn' t mind\nbecause it was pharmaceutical and most of all wouldn' t cause him trouble\nbeing a legal narcotic. Sarah took it too far when she crossed international\nborders with an illegal drug, risking her welfare and almost costing\nJeffrey public attention. She lost her apartment and contacts in the acting\nworld, only hearing from acquaintances once in a while that she was\nsinking deeper and deeper into the black hole of addiction. It was sad to\nfind out, as I always did like her.\nAt the island, Ghislane had just recently obtained her helicopter pilot' s\nlicense and wanted to get some practice airtime and flew Jeffrey and I to\nSt. John where we picked up Alexandria Cousteau, the grand daughter to\nthe inventor of the scuba tank and underwater explorer Jack Cousteau.\nGhislane was out to set us affright in the air, but it was all talk, she was\nactually an impressive pilot. Still a daredevil though, she got her kicks\nout of hearing us fret on the earmuffs intercom' s. Jeffrey made it clear\nthat Alexandria was a guest when I was told to adhere to her if she\nwanted a massage, which I obliged her with several times during our first\nmeeting. It was Jeffrey who instigated that her and I reenact as lovers in\nlesbian acts of foreplay and penetration. I couldn' t imagine a girl with\n67\n68\nrl Copyright Protected Maw C1 Copy,, ght Protected Malarial\nCONFIDI'.N'rIAL GlUFFRL004200\nGILTI RL004201\nCONFIDLNIIAL\nsuch high prospects lowering herself to something of Jeffrey' s standards,\nbut I later found out through Jeffrey that he had donated money to her\ncontinuous exploration into marine life and habitats. She had followed in\nher family' s footsteps, all of them involved in Marine Biology in some\nway or another. We actually got along really well, she was a real decent\ngirl, and loved talking about her passion, everything underneath the\nwaters surface.\nWhen I wasn' t busy giving massages to everyone around, her and I\nwould hang out together. Often we go swimming in the crystal clear pool\nof ocean that the Caribbean had to offer. Once we swam out so far not\npaying attention to our location and were carried out to sea by the current.\nWe took turns on the backs of each other, taking breaks against the strong\nocean tide. It was almost a possibility that we nearly drowned out there, if\nit weren' t for some guys on a boat out fishing for the day when they\ncaught us in their view. They picked us up and brought us back to the\nisland where we were reprimanded by a worried Jeffrey and Ghislane to\nfirst of all let someone know where we are going at all times, and never\nto lose sight of the shore while out for a swim. After that learning\nexperience I took their heed and proceeded with caution. I had a\nnewfound respect for the ocean and it' s mysteries.\nHaving such a lover of the water as a guest, made Jeffrey want to\nexplore parts of his Caribbean he had never seen before. The next\nmorning we were met by a scuba instructor in St. James and given a few\nlessons in how to use the gear and more tips like how to descend slowly\nto the ocean floor as not to cause blood clots as well as visual hand\nsignals to communicate underwater. It was so exhilarating beneath the\nwaters surface. No voices to listen too, only the enchanting sights to take\nin. We explored the surrounding reef and found a large squid, many of\nsea urchins, and the magnificent colored coral that housed a many of the\nrich variety of the local species of fish. It was such a great sight to take\nin. Holding a pernianent mental picture of those adventures to carry in my\nhead for all times.\nWe all had such a great time that Jeffrey hired the same scuba\ninstructor to come out the next day to scuba dive the safer parts around\nhis island. We got bored quickly with not much to see but seaweed and a\nfish here and there. It didn' t take long before Ghislane decided for us all\nto explore other numerous locations by boat, Jeffrey needed a bit of\nconvincing at first and the instructor was quick to assure him that he\nknew his way well around these waters, of course he would say that, he\nwas getting paid a hell of a lot to do this in the first place, why not extend\nit a few more hours?\nThe clear water glistened and the tropical array of marine life was on\ndisplay as we wanted to stop at so many places but you could see as\nbeautiful as it was it could be as equally dangerous. It took so long as we\nhad to veer away from so many desirable spots. Finally we found a good\nplace that the scuba instructor thought was safe. He buddied us up into\npairs and we jumped off the back of the boat into the crystal aqua blue\nwaters beginning our descent slowly into the darker regions of the oceans\nfloor. We were situated on open water with a cavern of reefs to venture in\nand around down below. It seemed to be quite a choice to scuba in, one\nthat our guide said he wasn' t familiar with but to alleviate his bored\nclientele deemed safe to swim around.\nIt was Jeffrey and the Guide together, Ghislane and Emmy, and I was\npaired up with Alexandria. Miles, the houseman, came with us and stayed\non the boat just in case something went wrong and lucky he did_ We were\nall too far under the water to hear his alarming screams of distress when\nshadow' s lurking in the murky distance started appearing closer and\ncloser. Ghislane actually looked frightened for once as she gave us the\nsignal to start ascending upwards, reminding us by holding her ears not to\ngo up to quick or as we were previously warned before we could pop a\nblood vessel in our brain and hemorrhage to death, not a very lovely\nimage but neither was getting torn apart by sharks.Those giant shadows\nbecame clearer and soon enough we could recognize their indistinct\nspecies as the terrifying and more aggressive breed of sharks, the\nhammerhead. Grabbing Miles hand I was the last one ahead of the Guide\nto get on the boat imaging the worst as I waited behind Emmy and\nAlexandria who were the next to follow after Jeffrey and Ghislane I was\nin too much shock to scream or cry, I just told myself I had to stay calm\nto get out of this alive. Unlucky for us we found out later on that we were\nin their breeding territory and being sent a clear message that we were\nsoon to be on the menu to their feeding frenzy.\nWe all felt like we had cheated death and 1 know it wasn' t only my\nheart that was still beating out of my chest when we headed back to\nJeffrey' s island. Jeffrey was pale as his designer sheets and looked like he\nhad aged another ten years in such a scared state. Ghislane took the heat\noff herself even barely taking a notice of beforehand and decided to poke\nfun at all of us frantically scurrying to get out of the water, it was just her\nnature, as I had never seen her move so quickly either. We got back to the\nisland and all collapsed our fatigued bodies in our own beds for a long\nnap. Freshened up and much more relaxed we regaled our horrendous\nstory again over dinner, this time in laughter. The following afternoon\nGhislane piloted us all in the helicopter to St. John' s Ail -port and we said\ngood- bye to Alexandra where we all parted ways. I met her a few more\nseparate times in Palm Beach at Jeffrey' s Mansion, but she wasn' t a\nregular of his, probably not as easy as the troubled girls were to bribe.\n69\n70\nF! Copyright ]',, rooted Mat - al L7 Copyright P,, t- tcd Material\nCONFIDEN I IAL GIUPPRE004202 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRL004203\nChapter 11\nThroughout the remainder of the quickly passing year I was on a\nconstant move with Jeffrey. Attending various dinner parties, mostly with\nother esteemed billionaires and widely acclaimed scientists. Jeffrey likes\nto surround himself with the most brilliant and powerful of minds, filling\nhis little black book with some of the most esteemed and even infamous\npeople in today' s wealthy society. It was during those intellectual\ngatherings that my body was also put on the banquet menu but this time\nfor a powerful senator George Mitchell and another prominent Nobel -\nPrize winning scientist who' s name would be mentioned but for all the\nlife of me can no longer remember. They would be only some of the\nrecognizable figures of the high society that became added to my list of\nclientele, of course being introduced to for a lot more than just a client of\nmassage.\nAs an amusement to Jeffrey' s associates I also knew my place was to\nentertain but not to every desired content. I was to show them a good time\nbut not the way I would have to use technique and effort for Jeffrey. The\nvery teachings from Jeffrey himself, or my tutor, as he liked to so\neloquently put it. Consistently being used and adored for the likeliness of\nmy youthful looks I was becoming very accustomed to my lifestyle with\nJeffrey, never really relaxing into it, but just accepting this as being as\ngood as it will ever get for me. I didn' t think I should be complaining,\nwasn' t 1 being offered a life in exchange for servitude? Just letting the\nsigns of my anxiety and depression pass me by while I blanketed them\nwith my pills, suffocating under a blanket of pain is all I was really doing.\nI spent Christmas and the New Years holidays with Jeffrey in N.Y.C,\nwho doesn' t celebrate the occasion, as he is of Jewish descent. Not that\nhe was a religious man anyways, I never even saw him celebrate\nHanukah either. We firstly stayed at his ranch in Santa Fe for a week,\nthen left for a long plane trip to Paris, France where we all suffered jet lag\nfor the next twenty four hours. We all stayed in a grand hotel with a view\nthe Champs' Elyse.\nEmmy and I shared a room and with her gifted ability to make new\ncontacts in just a few hours, she brought out a jay to share on the rooftop\nat nighttime while we were overlooking the lit up Eiffel Tower. We never\ngot really close as buddies but we both knew what we were indebted to\nand felt each other' s sorrows. All four of us went out shopping at Chanel,\nD& G, Ralph Lauren, and many other little exclusive boutiques the\nfollowing afternoon. As a gift Jeffrey bought me a white terry clothed\ngoose feathered sofa and had it sent back to my apartment in Florida, and\nbought some new tapestries to have sent back to Santa Fe for his ranch.\nWe also visited his up and coming Paris apartment. It was a modern,\ntypical flat being refurbished, and we went to see how it was all looking.\nJeffrey liked to fuss about every detail and harass the builder' s about their\nwork, changing last minute details at a whim.\nDays and many croissants later we left for Spain feeling bloated and\nsleepy. We only stayed in Spain for the afternoon, going to see another\nastounding Moroccan castle for Jeffrey to replicate at one of his many\nmansions. It was only a short plane ride to Tangier, Africa for more\ncastles hopping. We arrived at the historic landmark and the only five star\nhotel in Tangier called El Minzah in the village of Ville Nouvelle. The\ncity and outskirts were still very hostile at the time, females being warned\nto not walk the streets alone and not to leave the house after dark or be at\nrisk of being raped or worse.\nWhen we got to the room, it was oozing with every expected bit of\nextravagance that a luxurious historical palace should offer until 1 was\ngreeted with a pile of monkey poo in the very middle of my bed. Not a\nhappy camper 1 called Jeffrey, Ghislane and Emmy into my adjoining\nroom and they all had quite a good laugh at my expense. Within a\nmoments notice of a complaint call to the front desk and we had an\nattendant cleaning up my bed linen. The cleaner noticed the window was\nstill opened, he warned not to leave it ajar at nighttime just in case\nanother monkey wanted to make himself comfortable in my quarters.\nGhislane joked that maybe I should keep it open I might find a suitable\nhusband before I get any older. Always the instigator of a good joke but\nunable to take one herself she didn' t like when 1 poked back that it was\nmore in her recent taste of men, since she loved to brag about her\nrendezvous with her various lovers. Once she came back giddy as a\nschoolgirl with an explosion of news, with all the build up and excitement\nin her voice you' d think she was the next crown princess, but she had\ngiven George Clooney a blowjob in the bathroom at some random event,\nshe never let that one down.\nWe all went to explore the towns surrounding Moroccan castles and\nmeet their royalty that lived in them. Jeffrey' s personal interior designer' s\nmet us at the residences. They walked around hurriedly, scribbling notes\ninto their clipboards and whispering between themselves. The palaces\nwere historically unique and beautiful but I wondered how could they live\nso grandeur behind these walls when they lived in a city of such poverty\nstricken squabble. Beggars lined the streets, people could just go missing\nand no one could care less, and you heard of barbaric murders happening\nevery night. Against the advice of the Palace Attendant and Jeffrey' s\nwishes, I decided to take a stroll one afternoon, mainly just to take photos\nof exotic Africa and do some shopping in the village markets but 1 ended\nup being intrigued by a group of young children playing in the streets.\n71\n72\nI I Copyright Protected Material Copyright Protootod Matcrial\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004204 CONFIDENTIAL GIUITRE004205\nWhen I was noticed watching them, about fifteen of them came up to me\nand began to beg for money and food. I was over taken by the poor,\nhungry children and I felt sad for them all and wished I could help out\nsomehow. When the tide of kids washed away and the street went empty,\nI was overcome with intrigue at these two little boys. Brothers I found out\nlater on, and there only toy was an empty can they were kicking to each\nother in the middle of the street. Intelligent kids, they were able to speak\nthree different languages, including English and I was interested to ask\nthem about life here. They didn' t seem to notice or be bothered by their\npoverty stricken lives. They told me about their school and parents and I\nthought I had just heard the saddest story ever but they were accustomed\nto living like that like I had been so accustomed to my degrading lifestyle\nfor so long.\nI was compelled to empty out the contents of my purse, giving them\nover two thousand dollars in U. S currency. A passer- byer snapped a\nphoto of the kids and me for myself to take home as a personal souvenir\nbefore they rushed home to proudly show there parents the money. I told\nJeffrey later on of my good deed and he couldn' t believe I' d give away\nmy money so carelessly. He told me I had set up their parents with\nenough money to feed and shelter their family for a year. Wasn' t that a\ngood thing? I couldn' t believe it, not that I was well off or anything close\ntoo it, but to realize how lucky I was and to not have compassion for the\nlesser off, especially children of a third- world country, I wouldn' t be\nhuman anymore. Then again what did I expect from someone who could\nnumerously steal another man' s daughter for the use of his own sexual\npleasure with great ease.\nWe went out to lunch the following day with Jeffrey' s team of\ndesigners to wrap things up and after Jeffrey' s afternoon massage he went\nto the palace to have a nap. When I was all alone I thought I' d go see the\nculture of the local unique markets again and this time buy some trinkets\nto bring home. I got to sightseeing and took pictures of the legs of lamb\nhung over the blood drenched doorway over people' s homes as to warn\noff evil spirits and the ghettos where the local villager' s called home. I\nwalked into many of the market' s stalls and saw the most peculiar\nantiques, such as weaponry with the blood of it' s last victim stained on\nit' s sharp blades and body pieces of various animal' s for the use of\nreligious sacrifices. I was more interested in the different culture and\nrespecting their ancient way of life with interest, instead of squirming like\na tourist and getting grossed out. I thought it was so educational and\nenthralling in fact, I ended up buying a few sacrificial trinkets to have\nsent to my apartment in Palm Beach. Not to say that I wasn' t looking\nforward to getting back to the luxuries of western civilization it was a bit\nlike camping, fin and adventurous but as equally dangerous and thrilling.\nWhen we left for the final destination of our trip I was looking forward to\neating normal food again, not one to stray for foreign dishes, I' m a more\nof a cheeseburger and pizza kind of girl, a true sign of my American\nheritage.\nWe landed at the Heathrow Int' I Airport and greeted by a driver that\nwould take us to Ghislane' s town house in London' s central that Jeffrey\nhad recently bought and refurbished as a gift for her. Emmy said \" Good -\nBye\" at the airport, leaving us to go to her hometown in the rural\ncountryside nearby to visit family for a six- week holiday from work. It\nwasn' t a very long drive before we were in the heart of the city and at\nGhislane' s place. 1 thought it was a cheery townhouse that had character\nand the historical pub in front of it and cobblestone streets only added a\nunique charm to its presence. They were going out for dinner and invited\nme along with them but seeing I was so exhausted from all the travelling\nand looking a bit melancholy, I apologetically declined going Out for\ndinner that evening, I rather would be taking a few pills to catch up on\nsome needed sleep. \" Are you sure your Okay\"? Ghislane asked as she\nshowed me to my room, more considerate than she normally was but 1\nassured her that I was in absolute good health, just tired from all of the\nrecent jet lag. Without another word said she whisked off downstairs, to\nthe car where Jeffrey was waiting for her.\nI took the liberty to call my parents house to say \" Hello\" and catch up\nwith them since I hadn' t been home at all for the holiday season this year,\nalways too busy working. They sounded really happy to hear from me\nand my mom put me on the phone to talk to my brothers as well. I got to\ntell them about my travels abroad and I had some cool tribal stuff from\nAfrica that I bought for them. They sounded so proud of me, all of them,\nand why shouldn' t they be? In everyone' s convinced mind I was making\ngreat money, travelling the world, and meeting new faces everywhere l\nwent, why should I spoil anyone' s delusions, especially mine. I took my\nsleeping tablets and had a bath before falling into a deep and much\nneeded sleep.\nThe next morning I was woken up by Ghislane who I could tell was in a\nchirpy mood by the way she paraded through my closed door saying\nWake-up sleepy head\" and opened the window' s shutters to let in the\nbright sunlight, she had never done anything like this before and I knew\nimmediately something big was happening. She sat down on my bed as I\nrolled over from my deep slumber and I was able to mutter for an\nexplanation as to why she was awake so early. \" Besides the fact it is ten\no' clock in the morning and nearly time for brunch, we have a big day\nplanned out for you today.\" She was waiting for my cue to ask her \" What\nare we doing\", when I did, she responded with a convincing enthusiasm\nWe' re going shopping for a new ensemble\" she paused for a moment to\n73\n74\n7 Copyright Protected Material 0 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004206 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRL'004207\nbuild the suspense, before completing her sentence \" To go dancing with\na Prince of England this evening\". Hoping it would be one of the younger\ngenerations, i was disappointed when she told me he was the Duke of\nYork, Charles' s younger brother Andrew. I looked at her with a fake\nsurprised look, one I had to use on many occasions in my time with them,\nto give an impression of excitement. \" What... wow!\" I exclaimed with my\ngifted acting ability. It is a sad realization but I had grown more\naccustomed to seeing people for their significance rather than the good\nqualities they possessed, and was able to grin & bear the thought of what\nI expected lay in store for me.\nGhislane and I left shortly thereafter for the many lanes of designer\nshops to choose from in London. Her pep talks to prepare me for my\nduties towards royalty went on and on, giving me the obscure impression\nI was something of importance, at least for more than an evening. \" Make\nsure your bubbly and energetic, nobody want' s a dead horse\" was one of\nthe cheap tools she instilled me with. \" Who knows where this could lead\nfor you\" was another. As the day grew shorter my anxiety only\nheightened, anticipating the Prince' s arrival and unable to decide on an\noutfit, 1 picked out three. Our last stop for the day was Burberry' s for a\nnice handbag to compliment our chosen attire. We got back to her\ntownhouse with still a couple hours spare to get ready. After trying on all\nthree outfits and many mental debates with myself later, I decided on the\npink mini -tee and dazzling pair of denims with horses embroidered into a\npattern. It seemed a lot more my style and age group rather than the other\ntwo older looking sophisticated dresses I had picked out. I told myself I\nwas going dancing at a club not to an opera. As most young girls can be\nduring their body changes into womanhood, I felt awkward, you know,\nbig feet, freckles and body hair in unwanted places. They' re things you\njust don' t want when your seventeen and then you see these iconic\nbillboards of what femininity is supposed to represent and just don' t fit\ninto that picture, never feeling what we all are already... absolutely\nperfect. By the time I had got ready I was a nervous wreck, but trying to\nkeep my cool on the outside was an act. I thought it' d be a good idea to\ntake a few Xanax before the evening unraveled and my anxiety went\nthrough the roof.\nJeffrey and I were sitting in the lounge room downstairs, waiting for\nGhislane to finish getting ready. The room was silent, only stillness in the\nair. I stared at the mural painted onto the wall that I was facing. It was an\ninteresting piece of artwork. In great detail it illustrated a happy looking\nfamily sitting on a bench overlooking a pond that resided on a large piece\nof land with a beautiful home displayed. There were also hunting hounds\nand the hunters chasing a game of fox like the notorious \" English Hunt\nPieces\" throughout history. Jeffrey took notice of my enchantment into\nthe picture and in a hushed voice proceeded to tell me that it was a\nportrait of Ghislane' s childhood, the part she could be proud of. I never\nrealized how prominent her family' s history was in England, apparently\nas to Jeffrey' s attest, her Father was born of poor Jewish decent in\nCzechoslovakia, most of his family being killed upon Nazi invasion in\n1939. Fleeing to join the British Army as a young man, he changed his\nname a few times and made a lot of contacts in the field. After the war, a\nnewfound Robert Maxwell went into publishing using his army contacts\nto establish a business initially built upon publishing scientific books\nfrom occupied Germany. In time, Maxwell acquired several British\nnewspapers, among them the Daily Mirror, countering his wits against\nthe likes of Rupert Murdoch along the way. However, whilst constricting\nhis publishing empire, Maxwell compiled astronomical debts, and his\nequivocal financial dealings attracted the attention of governing\nauthorities that judged him not to be looking out for his companies best\ninterest and in the end it transpired that Robert Maxwell had been using\nproceeds from his employees pension funds to meet his financial debts,\nruining the futures of thousands of employees. Once an esteemed\nMember of Parliament and publishing mogul, Robert' s body was found\nfloating in the Atlantic Ocean after he was found to be missing from his\nyacht, the Lady Ghislane ( named after his favorite child), whilst cruising\nthe Canary Islands in 1991. Jeffrey went on to tell me that when her\nFather died she was inconsolable, and in a very bad state. He picked her\nup from the trenches of despair and took her under his wing, and it' s there\nshe has stayed comfortable ever since. To Ghislane his peculiar need to\nhave so many woman around and even his taste in younger than legal\none' s didn' t seem unconventional to her. It was her own Father who was\ndeemed a womanizer and even took a second wife whilst still married to\nGhislane' s mother. I would have never guessed this carefree, spirited, and\nvivacious woman had ever endured such sorrows. I couldn' t help but look\nat her in a different light from then on, but not letting her know that I\nknew, to avoid any altercations between us.\nLike clockwork Ghislane came downstairs five minutes before Prince\nAndrew were to arrive, wearing a tight -fitted white wooly turtleneck\nsinglet and a nice pair of loose fitting trousers. Looking elegant and\ncasual at the same time, a very hard look to achieve but one Ghislane had\nalways easily mastered. They both seemed at ease poking fin at my\nobvious nervous state, just another ordinary night out for this\nextraordinary couple. The knock came at the door just after six o' clock in\nthe evening. Ghislane greeted him and the guard who would wait for his\nreturn in the car. She led him down the hall to where Jeffrey and 1 were\nsitting. We both stood up and Jeffrey shook his hand, while Ghislane\nproceeded to introduce me and as I was taught by her was English\n75\n76\nCopyright Protected Material\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004208 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004209\ncustom, we both kissed on the check. We all sat down on the lounges for\nsome tea and biscuits while conversing idle chitchat. By the sounds of it,\nGhislane knew well of his recently divorced x -wife Fergie, whom they\nwere all taking turns in slandering her for one reason or another. It was\napparent there were some fresh wounds still lingering on and as good\nfriends do, it was their way of helping him get over her. When his\ndaughters were mentioned, Ghislane and Jeffrey treaded lightly, only\nspeaking highly of them, and offering their sympathy to the young ones.\nThe conversation turned to a much lighter subject. Andrew wanted to\nknow more about this young guest they had to join them out for dinner\nand dancing that evening and then the spotlight turned on me. I was more\nnervous than I had ever been before a night out with someone, probably\nthe build-up Ghislane and Jeffrey had hyped this meeting up to be. To\nbreak the ice, she played her favorite guessing game. -.\" how old do you\nthink Jenna is\"? When Andrew guessed correctly, I was seventeen years\nold, she was surprised, thinking I could have passed for younger. \" I guess\nwe are going to have to trade you in soon\" she laughed, always the first\none to throw in her quick-witted two bits, all of them chuckling along\nwith her. Hardly a laugh at all, unknown to me at the time his eldest\ndaughter is only five years my junior. I was finding it hard to make much\nconversation in the beginning, just laughing when the occasion called for\nit, and keeping up with Andrew' s constant glances in my direction, was\nall I could manage.\nThe restaurant was a close drive for us with Andrew, his two guards and\nhis driver following behind us. I was seated next to the Prince for dinner\nand Ghislane and Jeffrey next to each other, an evening pre -ordained. I\nwas supposed to flatter him with compliments and dote on his every word\nspoken, but I didn' t even do that for Jeffrey blatantly, it would' ve felt\nawkward to act like a bimbo for him. Instead I remained calm, cool, and\ncollected, hoping that my nervousness wouldn' t spill out at any given\nmoment. The next place we were going was much more my style, and I\nfound it easier to relax. We pulled up next to a Nightclub called \" Tramp\",\na member' s only nightclub, and one of the most exclusive haunts in the\nworld for the rich and famous to be seen for the last forty or so years\nsince it' s doors first opened. Andrew' s guards waited outside while we all\nwent in to hit the dance floor. Jeffrey being the social introvert that he\nwas found the first available empty seat in the corner but facing the dance\nfloor to spend the evening watching everyone else have fun and Andrew\nwent to the bar to grab us all drinks. He came back with sparkling water\nfor Jeffrey and a cocktail for the rest of us, already knowing that Jeffrey\nnever drank alcohol. We downed our glasses and made our way to the\ncrowded dance floor, where I had the Prince' s upmost attention. Moving\nhis hands across the curves of my body, not to shy away from the fact\nthat he was in public, he was whispering sweet nothings into my ear and\nkissing my neck. I would just giggle not really knowing how to reply to\nan aging man with a bad smile and terrible moves, it would sound too\nmuch of a lie if I retaliated back about his swagger. He was the most\nincredibly hideous dancer I had ever seen and couldn' t help but laughing\non the dance floor and shooting glances of embarrassment to Jeffrey and\nGhislane who were having a good time laughing at my expense... as the\nalways did.\nAfter an hour of pelvic smashing to the D. J' s pumping mixes we finally\nexited the floor, his royal highness was dripping with sweat and ready to\nembark onto a quieter scene where he said we could be alone, not\nknowing that it had already been arranged for all of us to meet back at\nGhislane' s place but complied with his so called thoughtful request. l was\nso anxious about getting back to the townhouse, knowing what\nexpectations I would have to not only have meet but also exceed in this\ncase. Ghislane and Jeffrey seemed impressed at my attempts to entertain\nhis royal highness, so far giving him exactly what he wanted the\nimpression that I idolized him. They told me that he really liked me and\nwas having a great time, so far tonight. When we got to the townhouse,\nhis guards walked him to the door, staying to wait outside in the car.\nGhislane met him and brought him upstairs where Jeffrey and I were in\nthe study. We all chatted in the hall for a few minutes and I was able to\nhave Jeffrey snap a photo of us together, one that would cause much\ncontroversy for the Buckingham Palace in many years to come. The\nconversation didn' t linger on much longer before Jeffrey and Ghislane\ndispersed downstairs together, leaving me to my own sort of royal duties_\nThey walked away giddy as if they were teenagers imposing on young\nlovers about to embark on a romantic evening.\nNext to the study was the bathroom where l led him to next. The room\nwas dimly lit masking the light from showing the disparity in my eyes. It\nwas a beige marble tiled floor with porcelain Victorian style bathtub in\nthe middle of the room and nowhere near the size of Jeffrey' s residences.\nI turned on the taps for the tub and the heat from the water began to steam\nup the small room. On the basin were aromatic oils, lotions and soaps,\nloving the scent of floral notes, I poured in the lavender bath oil. Trying\nto do the best of my youthfulness to try and act seductive, I gradually\nbegan to strip off my clothing, piece by piece. Giving him time to savor\nthe moment to come. He loved every second of it as I went over to where\nhe was waiting and watching, then began to undress him at a much\nquicker pace. We kissed and touched each other before submersing into\nthe hot water, where we both continued to reenact foreplay. He was\nadorning my young body, particularly my feet, caressing my toes and\nlicking my arches. That was definitely a first for me and I couldn' t help\n77\n78\nI ,\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDLN nAL\nCopyright Protected Material\nGIUFFRE004210 CONFIDENTIAL G1UI FRE004211\nbut laugh, I hoped he didn' t expect the same treatment back. Through my\nrecent experiences with Rena, I drew a line with extreme fetishes,\nespecially ones that would involve my tongue and feet in the same\nsentence. It wasn' t hard to get him wound up to the point where he just\nwanted to have the rest of me so we dried off from the cold and retired to\nmy bedchambers for the longest ten minutes of my life. Moments later\nand without any real emotional attachment, he burst in ecstasy, leaving\nme to my own feelings of dismay. As relieved as I was to see the\nexperience come to pass with him, it was finally sinking in that I would\nnever be anything more than but a muse. Still trying to ascertain a surreal\ndream a young girl once held but no longer the same girl I was no longer\nsure that the dream was even real anymore. In the whirlwind thrown\ntogether by wealth, power, and privilege I was but a grain of sand and felt\nhelpless down the road I was naively being led down. When the real\npicture was unveiled, later in my life, I had nothing but memories filled\nwith sorrow to remember of my teenage years.\nJeffrey, Ghislane, and I left for the states to conclude our long journey\nhome to the U. S. A. I was so happy when we landed on our soil and called\nT.J from my cell phone to see if he' d meet me at the airport instead of\ngoing back to Jeffrey' s, he' d be there within twenty minutes, he was so\nhappy to hear my voice and that I was back in town. So ecstatic to be\ngetting away from my life of servitude for the next few days, I was sourly\ndisappointed when I got off the phone. As if he' d been listening to my\nentire conversation, Jeffrey told me he' d like a massage back at his place\nand he could pay me at the same time for my trip with him. With much\ndismay I had to call T.J back and cancel the arrangements, I wouldn' t see\nhim until later that night, in which one of Jeffrey' s staff would drive me\nhome and 1 would be too exhausted to do anything.\nChapter 12\nWhen we got back to Jeffrey' s mansion in Palm Beach he wanted to\nthank me for showing his friend, the Prince, such a good time. Rewarding\nmy diligence with an extra sum of money and luring me deeper into his\ngoal of keeping me at his side as his personal amusement that he could\nlend out at anytime. Further proving his capability of using the vulnerable\nimpressions of a young girl to influence and intimidate his fellow peers of\nlike minds. Jeffrey didn' t want to know the grim details of how it all\nhappened on my intimate night with the Prince, he just asked simply if I\nthought that I did well in keeping his friend happy. Knowing already that\nthe evaluation of my performance I gave was already discussed between\nthem, I just as simply replied back with a nod of approval. Though I did\nhave a laugh with Jeffrey about the Prince' s weird fixation on my feet\nand lets just say that he was quite tickled with Andrew' s quirky\nobsession, having a good ol' chuckle at my eccentric encounter. I was\npaid extremely well this time, putting my money earned into nothing but\npopping pills and alcohol by shouting my so called friends a good time,\naiming for the attempt to forget about my experiences abroad. I partied\nlike that to feel young again, my age and most of all to self -anesthetize\nmy troubles from within. It wasn' t like I was waiting for someone to\narrive on his white horse and take me away to a magical world. I simply\nyearned for more out of life than being someone' s replaceable\namusement. Still a romantic at heart I would often get lost in my\ndaydreams, imagining a new beginning with a strong man that would\nshow me an enduring love, safety in his anus, and a lifetime friendship.\nThough the suggestion of true loves existence was only a dream for now,\nsomething I could only read about in novelistic fairytales but the passing\nthought from time to time was warmly envisioned. With my inner most\ndesires being locked away in a deep crevice of my heart, I knew my\nromantic notions would be absurd in Jeffrey' s eyes. For some unknown\nreason to me he couldn' t allow himself to give love or receive someone' s\nheart in return. Once he said to me when 1 asked him if he ever thought\nhe would settle down and find Mrs. Right and he told me he didn' t\nbelieve that love with one monogamous partner was possible but he\nfound that love with many was. 1 thought at the time it had something to\ndo with having so much money and everyone wanting him for that\ninstead of seeing him as a person and even felt bad for him, but now I can\nunderstand from his recent lessons unlearned that it was a simple\nequation of his twisted perversion to become infatuated with the\nvulnerable youth off the streets. Spending so much time in the entrapment\nof Jeffrey' s embrace, I was becoming numb to the feelings and aspiration\nto ever climb above this deep hole I had dug myself into. I knew I wanted\nto escape from this bizarre form of first class slavery but I still didn' t\nhave the tools necessary to help me get out. How could I have? Everyone\nthat knew me believed I was living this enchanting life, a rags to riches\nsuccess story that most people dream of, only I knew the price to be paid\nfor all of this and I was the only one who could pay for it.\nUnderestimating my true self, I was settled by Jeffrey' s side for now\nconsidering him to be someone to look up to, my mentor. Such a\n79\n80\nI1 Copyright 11,— ted Material Copyright P— cwd Mawrial\nCC>NFIDEN\"r1AL OLUFrRL004212 CONFIDENrLAL 011FRL004213\ncomplicated battle within myself, it is one 1 still ache to fully comprehend\ntoday.\nSunny spring days melted away the ice off the frozen streets of New\nYork and the harsh winter winds begun to gently blow away the dead\nleaves, making the caged trees appear to have some form of life again. I\nhated the cold winters there, it would only add to my depression being\nlocked indoors. Give me hot Florida days blistering in the sun where I\ncan swelter by a cool pool and sip cocktails with pieces of fruit and little\noriental umbrella' s floating around. What a vision of solace? Looking\naround my extravagantly decorated mid -evil room I was reminded of the\ndesolation that I was more than accustomed too. Knowing it wouldn' t be\nlong before I was summoned again for another ritualistic occurrence in\nfornicating with my master, I hardly bothered to leave my assigned\nchambers, scarcely being sent home for a moments break, I just accepted\nmy fate. As I predicted the intercom buzzed momentarily and I heard\nGhislane' s voice come over and request to meet them in Jeffrey' s study.\nNot an odd call, I would often meet him there first so he could tie up\nsome unfinished business before heading to the dungeon, or what was\nthought to be the massage room. Making my way down the hall, I had an\neerie feeling wash over me, as if I had several pairs of eyes on me,\nwatching my every move. A cold chill moved up my spine and I had to\nmove my thoughts elsewhere, too easy behind these walls to succumb to\nmy fearsome anxieties. I punched in number one once inside the elevator\nand it took me down to the floor where Jeffrey and his surprise guest\nwere waiting with anticipation behind closed doors. I cracked open the\nheavy wooden doors and a familiar face revealed itself. Definitely not\nexpected or pre -warned on my part but I already knew what he was here\nfor or at least why I was called down to the study. Prince Andrew had\nthat notorious cheesy grin slapped over his face, as he looked me up and\ndown like a shiny new car on display and he was about to take it for a test\ndrive. Ghislane led me to the decadent sofa he was lounging on and\ntwirled me around to give him a good lookover before sitting me down on\nhis lap. Like a show pony I knew exactly how they wanted me to be\nparaded around, with the last of my dignity long lost, I had nothing more\nto lose. It was easy to give them the reaction they desired, all I had too do\nwas pretend to be entertained by their lewd gestures, and when Andrew\ncupped my breast with a doll made in his image, I only giggled away.\nGhislane wanted to take a picture of the bizarre scene and even got\nJohanna, another one of Jeffrey' s so- called personal assistants, to come\nsit on his other knee for the snapshot, giving the impression girls couldn' t\nstay away from Randy Andy.\nMany crude jokes later and I was asked to show Andrew to the upstairs\nmassage room. I' m sure he already knew where it was from previous\nencounters with Jeffrey' s \" staff' but I led the way anyways, as if he was\nnow my guest of honor. Entering into the dim room it took a few minutes\nfor my eyes to adjust to the darkness, but knowing my way around the\nroom was enough to find the shower. I turned on the steam room and\nbegan to undress myself. Andrew followed my lead and disrobed,\nthrowing his attire to the floor. I wanted to nm and hide feeling his hands\ntouch me again, but my servitude for Jeffrey kept me there. Getting out of\nhis stronghold I turned my attention to the steam tilling up and tried to\nturn his attention to the marble bench where 1 suggested he take a seat\nwhile I rubbed his feet. By the look in his eyes I knew he could care less\nabout a foot massage, his real desires were being shown by the arousal\nhis body was forming. He indicated where he wanted me to touch him\nand how. I fulfilled his seedy requests, but only just. There was no\npleasure in this for me, the only thing I derived from this event was to\nsink further into my slumber of depression. I couldn' t remember a time\nwhen I felt needed for anything other than my body or amusements\nthereof. After his massage was thoroughly conducted I couldn' t wait to\nget back to my room for another shower. Sitting on the floor of the\nshower under the harsh spray of water, I scrubbed my body where he\ntouched me. Feeling abhorrent and ashamed what I had become, I let the\nwater wash away the grime.\nAs the days progressed into nights and the nights followed a trail of\ndestructive months, my outlook on life had diminished into utter sadness.\nI had lost my spark and my ability to look like I could handle the abusive\nstate of affairs I had drifted into. Sinking deeper in the euphoric state of\nbeing on coke and pills, not only was my mentality dwindling away but\nalso my looks. I sure as hell didn' t feel like a seventeen year old anymore\nand now I wasn' t looking like one. My eyes had dark circles underneath\nthem from not sleeping and my bones protruded from my skinny\nwaistline and chest. This made Jeffrey apprehensive in keeping me\naround as often and before I had a moments notice, 1 was out of money\nand looking for a job. When I questioned him what was happening, lie\ntold me I wasn' t the same girl he had first met some time ago now and\nlooked like I needed a break from working so much. \" I' ll call you next\ntime I' m in town\" was the last thing he said to me.\nChapter 13\nGoing back to an average teenagers life was more of a harder transition\nthan 1 would' ve ever thought. Jeffrey stopped paying my expensive rent\nand I was forced to get off the drugs and look for a real job to feed and\nshelter T. J and L It was much harder than it sounded, but I was craving\n81\n82\nCopyright P, cawed Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\nGIUFFRE004214\nU Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\nGIUFFRFA04215\n\nthis in every possible way. Even though a week' s wages for working a\nfull- time job as a waitress didn' t come close to the money I had made in a\ncouple hours of working for Jeffrey, I was happier than i had been in a\nlong time. I made some friends at my new job and found my duties to be\neasy and pleasant. I was good at making customers smile and keeping\nthem happy becoming the waitress that made the most tips for the night,\nwhich in turn made my co- workers happy since we' d all split the tips at\nthe end of the week. For the first time in a long time I had boys my age\nhitting onto me, and not that I was ever taken aback by there attempts but\nit reminded me of how it felt to be around a younger crowd. I missed so\nmuch of what I couldn' t get back and the more I tasted it, the more I\nremembered how to smile. The relationship between T. J and I began to\nfalter in a way that was beyond reconciliation. Fights became physical\nand I saw sides to him that only pushed me away more. He refused to\nlook for work to help pay bills and he became utterly frustrated not\nhaving his usual cocktail of assorted drugs to keep him from feeling\nanything at all. He didn' t like the fact I was growing inside and thinking\nbeyond his elusive world. I had gone through too much to accept another\nform of abuse and degradation. Making that point very clear to him by\nkicking him out of my apartment back to live with his parents, I felt\nliberated like never before. I kept up with my rent and cleaned my act tip.\nEnrolling in a yoga course and keeping my focus on staying fit and\nhealthy became my only source of enjoyment. Iwas free and living for\nmyself.\nWhile out doing the grocery shopping one evening I couldn' t help but\nstop at the local pet store and fell in love with a furry pooch. She was a\nJapanese Chow -Chow and a bundle of fur that more resembled a baby\nbrown bear than a dog. 1 took her home with me and instantly she became\nmy best friend. We went for several walks a day and she bore the brunt of\nmany tear filled conversations, she was my loyal companion who\nunderstood more than anyone had before, all I really need was someone\nto listen and funny enough it was her that filled that hole.\nNearly three months had gone by and not a word from Jeffrey or\nGhislane. With T.J out of the picture now too all I had to concentrate on\nwas work, my parents and brothers, and of course my dog, Mary -Jane. I\nwas going to family night dinners and bon fires again. My older brother\nwas getting married to an amazing woman in a few weeks and I got to be\napart of their beautiful ceremony. Small details of life' s journey that I\nalready missed so much of and now being able to smile at the simple\nthings day in day out really seemed to put the real value of life into\nperspective for me. Everything seemed to be working out for itself and I\nwas really happy, until he came back, T. J thought he' d come over my\nplace one evening while I was sitting at home just watching TV.\nObviously mentally distorted from whatever choice of drugs he was\nsmoking that night. He screamed down my apartment complex, going\nmad and scaring my neighbors I felt like I had no choice but to let him\ninside. I tried talking to him as a good friend would, just wanting him to\nsee what he was doing to himself and what he had become. Part of me\nstill loved him and took pity on watching him spiral downwards. Taking\nhim back into my life was not a decision I made whole- heartedly, but was\nsomething I did out of guilt and what I thought was loyalty. He moved his\nclothes back to my place, which was all he ever owned anyways and we\ntried to pick up the broken pieces. T.J being still badly addicted to many\ndrugs, I had to be very careful where I kept my jewelry and expensive\nitems. I decided to rent out a space at a local spot and store my cherished\nitems away, just taking the necessary precautions, 1 thought.\nStill not working I knew how he was scraping by money and I didn' t\nagree with it, T.J was a known thief and had been caught several times\nattempting to steal things, even as stupid as DVD' s and PS2 or Xbox\ngames from a local Blockbuster. He even stole from his parents, his sister\nand his brother and would probably steal a piece of candy from a five\nyear old kid if he knew that it would get him his next fix. He hated the\nchange in myself, realizing I couldn' t be brought back down by his ways\nbut knowing I still stuck by his side and defended him from anything that\nwould hurt him wanting to believe that he still wanted show the bits of\nhuman nature left in his empty heart.\nUnable to stand by and see me do well for myself he contemplated a\nway to try and bring me down. After a busy shift one night, he retaliated\nwith another show of control. I hadjust finished cleaning up my area and\nsetting out the tables to be ready for the next day when I went to the bar\nto hang up my apron and put my nights tips in the tip bowl on the counter\nby the beer tap. On one of his drug induced rampages he stormed into the\nrestaurant where I was working and started to pick a fight with me. I\nknew he was off his face when he started accusing me of sleeping with\nmy manager on shift that evening. Having no bias or ground to stand on\nin his attempt to make me look bad in front of everyone, I just laughed\nhim off as a drunk idiot who needed to go home and sleep off the night' s\nrepercussions, although I was fuming inside that he embarrassed me but I\nstill made excuses for him and told my boss I had to leave early to bring\nhim home.\nThe bar was deserted as T.J waited alone for me slumped in a barstool\nand looking worse for wear. I had to go to the back of the restaurant and\ndo some explaining to the manager on duty, I couldn' t afford to lose my\njob over this incident. Surprisingly he was sympathetic towards my\ndilemma and even told me I could do a lot better than that schmuck,\npatting my back and telling me to have a couple days off. I punched out\n83\n84\n1 Copyright protocted Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\nCopyright protected Material\nGIUFFRE004216 CONFIDENTIAL GI1JFFRE004217\nand headed to my car with T. J in tow. For the rest of the night he was\noddly quiet and asked to be dropped off at his parent' s house, I was more\nthan obliged to do so. I couldn' t stand the sight of him let alone want to\nbe around him tonight. Being so revved up it didn' t yet dawn on me that\nsomething wasn' t right. The next morning I was woken up by an alerting\nphone call, I had the manager from the restaurant where I worked, on the\nother end screaming at me and asking where the money is. I sat up in bed,\ncompletely awake now, and asked him back, \" What are you talking\nHis tone had calmed a bit and he could hear the\nabout, what money?\"\nearnestly in my voice and explained his accusations \" The tip jar was\nempty after you had left last night and there was over a hundred and fifty\ndollars in there, now it' s missing\". The answer hit me instantly and I got\na terrible knot in my stomach _ T. J. When I left him at the bar not even\nthinking about the tip bowl to talk with the manager, he saw an\nopportunity to fund more drugs and he took it. That' s why he didn' t even\nwant to come back to my apartment last night. It was all too clear for me\nnow and I tried to explain to my manager about my boyfriend' s sickness\nand asked him to take the lost money out of my wages. \" I have no choice\nbut to let you go and file a police report for the missing money\". I\ncouldn' t believe what I was hearing. How did things turn upside down so\nquickly? I exclaimed \" Even though I' m paying you from my pocket for\nmoney I didn' t even steal and you' ve never even had any problems from\nme before?\". His apologies were short and icy, nothing that could be\ndone. I slammed down the receiver only to pick it up again to dial T. J' s\nparents house and to no surprise he hadn' t slept there last night and was\nnot able to be reached. I felt like I was in a bad dream I couldn' t wake up\nfrom and with no money to pay rent, eat, or even survive, I was back to\nthe drawing board.\nThe week passed without hearing from T. J, he was in hiding, for now.\nWhen the phone rang early one morning I expected it to be him, instead it\nwas a surprise phone call from a familiar voice. Jeffrey decided to give\nme a call to invite me over to his Palm Beach mansion for some lunch\nand to catch up, it really was just his way of finding out if I was cleaned\nup and ready to come back to work for him. With my life in chaos once\nagain and having to borrow money off my parents for grocery food, I saw\na quick solution to my situation and was even convinced this is what I\nhad to do to take care of myself.\nHe greeted me at the door and led me inside. Ghislane was at her usual\nspot, her desk working away, and we headed past her with a quick wave\nand lip -synced a \" Hello\", not wanting to disturb her important sounding\nphone call. She glanced up quickly and gave a brisk wave my way, then\nput her attention back to the computer. Once we were inside the poolside\ncabana, which was Jeffrey' s office, & gym, Jeffrey took a seat behind his\ndesk and told me to have a seat across from him. He took a sip of water\nfrom an already poured glass and asked if I' d like some. \" Yes, Thank\nyou\" My reply was short and polite, already just wanting to get this\nmeeting done and over with. His face was like steel and his expressions\nwere stern, I felt like a child in trouble sitting in the principles office.\nHe cut straight to the chase wanting to know \" Are you on drugs\nanymore?\" There was a moment' s pause as I took a deep breath and told\nhim the entire truth. \" I got really depressed for awhile and coped with my\nemotions by blanketing them with mind -altering substances. Just smoking\na jay to relax wasn' t good enough anymore. 1 needed to be high and\nflying to believe I was happy and dealing with all of life' s curveballs.\nSnorting things like coke and popping amphetamines replaced my\nsorrows with an overflow of endorphins, making it possible to keep up\nwith everything, until 1 would come down and the cycle just kept on\nrepeating itself'.\nHe listened to me continue to tell him about the good things that have\ncome from the break. Like my dog, yoga, and working at a restaurant,\nmaking lots of new friends but most of all, I got my smile back, without\nthe drugs this time. He was really happy to hear the upside of everything,\nbut there was one thing I was reluctant to tell him about. My recent\ntravail that T.J effortlessly caused at the restaurant where I was so happily\nemployed. As my manager had warned he had to file a police report\nstating that after I had left, the tips were gone, putting the blame solely on\nme.\nGiving Jeffrey a clear picture of the entire ordeal he exclaimed \" What\nare you doing with this idiot Jenna, he is no good for you! I know you can\ndo better for yourself, why do you let him drag you down every time?\"\nNodding my head in concurrence I went on to finish my epic drama. \" I\nreceived a phone call from the PBCP asking me to come in about the\nmoney, I told them what happened over the phone but they still want me\nto come in. I don' t want to have a record for something I never did or\never would do!\" I put my face into my hands and covered the tears now\ntrickling down my cheeks. \" I just can' t believe this is happening to me\nwhen everything has been going so uphill, now I' m out of work and in\ntrouble\" I wiped my face and looked up at him \" What do I do?\" Enabling\nhim as my mentor once again, his sly grin said it all. Jeffrey normally\nhated when girls made waves in any way and this one would be\nconsidered a tsunami but this time it worked to his favor. He wanted me\nto come back to work for him, continuing my massage studies and I\nneeded his help. In his eyes he was doing me a solid, which in return I\nwould have to scratch more than his back for. Taking his time to\ncontemplate what to respond back and what solution he could offer, 1\nbegan to worry that maybe I shouldn' t have done this.\n85\n86\nCopyright Protected Material\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRL004219 CONFIDLNTIAL GIUFTR 004219\nPulling a few tissues out of the box, he passed them across the desk to\nme. Trying to retract any damage done 1 said to him \" I must look like\nsuch a mess to you and making you listen to my saga, I am so sorry... I\nshouldn' t have come to you with all of this.\" He looked surprised and\nsympathetic \" Quite the opposite actually. I' m glad you' ve come to me for\nhelp. I have got a lot of connections especially with the Palm Beach\nCounty Police Department. I give them regular hundred thousand dollar\ndonations, and after I speak with them there will be nothing more to\nworry about. To be honest I' m more in shock about how much can\nhappen to you in such a short time, your life is one big soap opera\"\nNow he was chuckling and trying to make light of my somber mood.\nLaughing along too I replied, \" I know right? Drama just hangs around\nme like a bad smell\". We did some more light-hearted catching up and\nwent out to the poolside for some lunch and a swim, concluding the\nevening with an erotic massage upstairs. He paid me the usual two\nhundred dollars and asked me to come back tomorrow. \" In the meantime\nI don' t want you thinking about your sticky situation, consider it dealt\nwith\". His attempt to brighten my spirits had worked relieved about\nmoney and the police but now I owed myself to him feeling indebted to\nhim more now than ever.\nChapter 14\nAs was promised I never heard back from the Police Department and\nJeffrey had his favorite girl back by his side. We picked up where we left\noff ever better than before, I being entirely subservient to every sexual\ndesire of his engaging myself in any role he wanted me to play. As he\nwas getting older his appetite for sex never hazed, if anything it only\nincreased. The orgies with other girls got larger in numbers and his\nappeal to younger girls, new toys and wilder nights expanded from once\nand awhile to quite an often occurrence in Jeffrey' s company. I put it\ndown his new friend and business investment, Jean -Luc Brunel.\nA long time agent for young and upcoming models, Brunel, a French\ncitizen, was known for roaming the world in search of young, naive\nbeauties living in poverty stricken countries and willing to do just about\nanything for money. He would procure them mostly from Clubs in South\nAmerica and the Former Soviet Republic. Filling their heads with\nfairytales of America and large amounts of money, he would promise\nthem all of the finer things in life, sometimes even throwing a pill in their\ndrink, if that meant getting them in his bed was becoming too much of a\ntask. What he wanted is what he got, which is why him and Jeffrey\nultimately became close pals and he invested one million dollars into\nBrunel' s company. In return Jeffrey now had supply of girls on tap for\nhim to choose from.\nWith the assistance of each other, Brunel obtaining the illegitimate\nvisas for underage -overseas girls and Jeffrey housing them at his\nbrother' s apartment complex on 301 E 66\"' St, Manhattan, they were\nquite the team. Jeffrey and Brunel would charge them for rent, forcing\nthem to work for them selling their bodies for money, nude pictures, and\neven pornography. These were what seemed like really nice people with\nnot so nice intentions setting an impression of how the dignified wealth\nplay and behind closed doors they had as much civilized manners as a\nbarbaric chimpanzee in heat. Giving a girl a step- up in finances by\nteaching them there only worth is what lay between their legs, its girls all\nwere the same in the end, regardless of what country we came from, what\nlanguage we spoke or our cultural indifferences, we all were being used\nfor one thing alone, our youthful looks and beautiful bodies.\nBeing Jeffrey' s permanent sidekick, I would have to part -take in a\nmany of the hedonistic exploitations that went on at one of his.many\nresidences, which meant having to be uninhibited with many girls my age\nand younger. Being complete strangers was hard enough but we couldn' t\neven understand each other, speaking in different tongues we were\nexpected to excel at preforming many acts of lovemaking and foreplay on\neach other, while being observed by a man in a corner jerking off. Not\nexactly what I would call an advantage in my stage of life, but in my head\nI was convinced we all had to do what we had to do to get on with life\nand if that meant doing all of this to keep Jeffrey happy, then 1 would do\nthat.\nIt didn' t take long in the accompaniment of Brunel for Jeffrey to hit an\nall time low, at least one that I knew about. Stupid enough or sick\nenough, l don' t know which one it is or both but Jeffrey bragged about\nhis birthday present from Brunel, once accepting three, twelve year old\ngirls, sisters at that. He replayed the descriptive events with me telling me\nhow they all massaged him and finished him off orally. He was so excited\nabout the entire event, replaying over and over again over the next course\nof weeks how cute they were and how you could tell they were really\nyoung by the small amount of hair growth in their pubic region and nonexistent\nbreasts. A twelve year old, are you serious? I thought to myself.\nI still can' t shake the feeling of disgust when I recall the look on his face\nas he told me time and time again of how his lust brought him to that\nprofound low. He went on to tell me how Brunel bought them in Paris,\nFrance, from their parents. Offering them the usual sums of money, visas,\nand modeling career prospects was a bribe of the worst kind, they were\njust children. Laughing the whole way through, Jeffrey thought it was\n87\n88\nE Copyright Protected Material\nCopynght Protected Material\nCONFIDENI IAL GIUFFRE004220 CONFIDENTIAL. OIUFFRE00422I\nabsolutely brilliant how easily money seduced all walks of life... nothing\nor no one that couldn' t be bought in his eyes. Behind the two of them\nfollowed a destructive trail of those in their path that were misused,\nviolated, degraded in a variety of ways for one purpose... to satisfy the\ndesires of the perversion that rotted their hearts.\nThe next couple of months I spent in Jeffrey' s company, my life was\nrevolved around him and his petty happiness. Arising to the occasion, I\nwas no longer his teenage sidekick, I was growing into being a young\nwoman and my body was blossoming like never before. Out of the\nawkward stages of my life, I now took to looking after myself like never\nbefore. Regular sessions in tanning beds and keeping fit became my life\noutside of Jeffrey. He kept telling me what a beautiful woman I was\ndeveloping into and would offer suggestions to help me look good.\nSending me to dentists for regular teeth whitening consultations or\nhelping me choose my attire for the evening,, he was ushering me into a\nwhole new position, training me up for something else, but I was unsure\nof what that was.\nBeing a snotty little teenager was a girl of the past. Now I had to be his\neloquent speaking, desirable to all and almost his personal porcelain doll.\nI went everywhere with him again, all of his eclectic dinner parties,\nconferences, and meetings with various members of parliament, famous\ncelebrities, and other esteemed billionaires.. most of whom lived by the\nsame rule of thumb as Jeffrey did. Quite an alarming realization having to\naccept this world the way it is_ Jeffrey knew all of the right people in this\ngame, and trading girls for favors is how he kept in the circle. He was at\nthe center of it all, blackmail being the only thing next to money with the\nability to pull a many of strings, his conniving ulterior motive was to drag\nall that he could down to his pitiful state of mind. Inviting easily tempted\nacquaintances to his island or his other various residences he would bring\nout the assortment of young girls and pass them around like they were\ncocktails on a platter. No girl had a choice in whom they went with, only\ncompleting a task, we would have to charm and bedazzle these ageing fat\nmen who other than paying for it would' ve never had a shot at getting to\nknow a beautiful girl intimately. I personally belonging to Jeffrey rarely\nhad to be loaned out and it was a big occasion, or should I say favor, if I\nwas. I' ll never really know what made me so important or special to\nJeffrey, it definitely had nothing to do with love. I guess in the end I will\nalways put it down to my capability of being whomever he wanted when\nhe wanted, so compliant it just made it easy for him to have a personal\ntoy at his constant disposal. All I can say is I lived in a jail with no bars,\nand in a country where slavery was supposedly abolished a long time ago\nbut still existed right underneath everybody' s noses. Myself and so many\nother girls were walking proof of it.\nI still was given proper training in massage therapy from time to time,\nkeeping me from looking back at being a teenager with no responsibilities\nto being a young adult with prospering titles. He knew I wanted to be selfsufficient\nso bad I would do anything for it and by giving me this dream\nto hold to only kept me in check. I looked forward to my training\nsessions, holding onto every word passed down to me and after the\nsession was complete I would hurry back to my room and transfer the\ninformation into a workbook with associating exercises.\nTrying my new moves on Jeffrey always impressed him, he would get\nexcited hearing about my passion for knowledge and would tell me he\ncould see it transfer into my massages, always giving it my all, my hands\nwere a focused energy when I was at work. Using every ounce of strength\nto apply on a body, many were astounded in what 1 could do for being\nsuch a small girl, and Jeffrey loved it, using me for a two- hour massage\nwith benefits\" sometimes being over twice a day. Ghislane would\nsometimes use me to massage her still but it wasn' t as common, she\npreferred a man for that job.\nThen would come the odd client here and there, of course set up by\nJeffrey. Most of which were orchestrated to get beautiful girls\ncomfortable and consequently naked then he would go in for the kill, so\nto speak, touching them intimately, in their most private of places like\ntheir vagina, breasts or anal. When he had us where he wanted, willing\nand able, then would come the toys, outfits and so on. A scheme he has\nused time and time again, telling those who know him well \" he had never\nbeen turned down yet\". It was starting to dawn on me how 1 wasn' t\ngetting any clientele that weren' t used for Jeffrey' s benefit and would\nmake me wonder if I just wasn' t good enough for that, but I kept quiet,\nnever wanting to make waves like I had before.\nTo give me a break from it all as if Jeffrey didn' t want to overload me\nagain, he would send me away to his ranch for a few days, what he knew\nI considered being a small slice of heaven on earth. I' d spend my days\nroaming the hills, riding horses, and enjoying the solitude of my own\ncompany. One afternoon I was out exploring the land on Jeffrey' s ranch\nwhich covered hundred' s of acres with nothing but a bottle of water, my\nsketchbook and a small case of oil paint. I was on the search for\nsomething interesting to paint. A great pastime of mine, it made my soul\nquiet by creating beauty with my brush, I loved to recreate the images I\nsaw on paper. I would paint anything beautiful that caught me eyes\ninterest, from underwater scenes, animals to people and even fruit, I loved\nvibrant colors and emotion on display but my favorite soon became the\nlandscape of the Santa Fe' s rolling hills and earthly green and beige tones\nand in certain light it would illuminate into a golden shine. To grasp that\nfeeling I was absolved in at the hardest of times became my greatest inner -\n89\n90\nI Copyright protected Material Copyright Protected Material\nCONF1DLNr1AL GIUFFRE004222 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRL004223\nachievement, like taking a piece of that serenity and putting on paper for\nme to keep in my heart where it still is today, closing my eyes I am able\nto see it, being there anytime I need to. I was enjoying the heat and taking\nin the deserts sights when I stumbled off the track and into the\nwilderness. Exploring everything new to me was my second nature and\nnever even entered my mind what would' ve happened if I went too far or\ngot lost. I would rather face Mother Nature' s wrath than humankind' s any\nday!\nAfter about an hour of drifting off track I came to a pile of rubble,\nlooking like the remnants of an old pueblo made out of clay and rock. I\npicked up what looked like half of a clay bowl and noted that it had\nIndian designs etched into the side of it. Excited about my findings I\ndecided to do some more exploring around the fields surrounding the\nhistoric site. I collected rare pieces of arrowheads, utensils, and parts of\nmany broken bowls with artwork telling tales of their own_ Time was of\nno essence here and before I even realized the sun had sunk deeper into\nthe hills leaving me without any light to find my way back to the\npathway. Feeling silly now after passing by a familiar looking boulder\ntwice over, I was startled when I heard some poor animal become dinner\nfor another, it' s screams of agony only amplified louder and echoed in\nmy ear drums, heightening the hairs on the back of my neck and making\nmy heart beat nearly out of my chest.\nI was lost and confused before but now I was petrified with fear.\nTaking me over three hours to find my way back to the path and in the\ndirection of Jeffrey' s mansion was a mission, so relieved in the end and\nso were the housemaids after I hadn' t showed up for dinner, assuming I\nmust' ve been out for one of my usual adventures. I went to bed\nstrenuously exhausted that night and as I was falling asleep the phone\nrang, it was a call from Jeffrey who had been alerted of my\ndisappearance. \" What happened tonight, one of the maids called me to\ntell me you hadn' t come back from your walk this evening\" Detecting a\ntone of anger in his voice I tried to distract him by telling him of my\nfindings and he scolded me for being gone for so long without anyone\nknowing where I was. Going back to the Indian remnants, I persisted on\ntelling him what I had found. In the end he was just worried about me\nbecoming a liability, but had to make it sound as if he cared. \" Don' t\nworry Jeffrey, I won' t be doing that again. I can honestly say I have\nlearned my lesson and the next time I want to explore I promise to take\nsomeone with me\". I satisfied his worry of me being a future nuisance\nand with that I was finally able to tell him what I had discovered on my\nwalls. He was impressed but did not sound surprised. \" You must' ve been\ngone a long time if you found the old Indian pueblo' s, just be careful you\ndon' t say anything about where you found the stuff on my property, it\ncould become a sight for historical preservation and that means the\ngovernment could ultimately own my land.\"\nI acknowledged his request and told them they were just a gift for my\nMom, who was in love with Indians \" Wait until she see' s I brought her\nback real artifacts, she is going to totally freak out.\" He didn' t mind that I\nwas taking them. In fact he admired my curiosity and adventurous spirit.\nHe reminded me that tomorrow was my last day. I would be driven to the\nAlbuquerque International Airport the day after next, to meet Jeffrey in\nNew York, for how long, only he knew. Giving Jeffrey many thanks for a\ngreat week, letting him know how much I appreciated these small breaks\naway, we then said goodnight. Hanging up the phone 1 had caught my\nsecond wind and set out to the kitchen to find a late- night snack. Raiding\nthe fridge and pantry, I found some frozen pizzas and popcorn. I put on a\nmovie and munched on the popcorn while the pizza cooked. Some 1980' s\ndreadful alien flick got the better of me that night. It was based on a true\nstory about people abductions from extraterrestrial beings, which were,\nlike I was, visiting a remote area. I suddenly hated being alone on a ranch\nin the middle of nowhere. I munched down my burnt, crunchy pizza and\nbecame further enveloped in the thick plot. Leaving on the TV and the\nlights on that night, I spent my night tossing and turning, peeking through\nthe small open crevices of the comforter, half expecting to see an alien\nbeing in my bedroom.\nLiving through the night was a relief and 1 laughed at myself in the\nmorning, how spooked did I get? When I got to New York, Jeffrey, and\nGhislane had a good laugh over my tale of survival in the wilderness and\nthen the alien scare. \" Your always having the best adventures\" Ghislane\nexclaimed. We were similar in that way, both being s bit of free spirits it\nwas really only her non- existence of moral standards that differentiated\nthe two of us, in that way. \" How do you know you weren' t abducted and\nprobed? I mean look at you and all that time alone on the ranch, what do\nyou think Jeffrey, could she pass off as an alien?\" Expectedly, Ghislane\npoked fun at me, her usual fun past time. Our relationship was an odd\none, never threatened by each other but always precautions towards one\nanother nonetheless able to crack a joke together, but when it came time\nto \" work\" it was no flan and games, she was intensely serious. \" With a\nsense of humor like yours I would tend to think that you are the one from\nanother planet.\" Just friendly banter between the two of us, then Jeffrey\nhad to jump in with his two bits, \" I think you might be onto something\nGhislane.\" 1 squinted my eyes and gave them both an exaggerated death\nstare and pretended to grab my stomach in pain, \" 1 think some things\ntrying to get out of me\", putting my fist in my shirt to reenact a scene\nfrom Alien, I fell onto the couch and faked my death. \" 1 knew it\"\nGhislane shouted and jumped on me to begin tickling me all over and we\n91\n92\nCopyright Protected M, W,,,, l\nCONFIDLN' I IAL\nU Copyright Protected Material\nOIUFFRL004224 CONFIDENTIAL OIUITRE004225\nall broke out into laughter. It was those fun times that made me feel like\nwe were all apart of this really perplexed family. We did everything\ntogether similar to normal families like eat dinner, watch TV, and travel it\nwas only the hedonistic and corrupt side to these two deviates that made\nthem a peculiar pair.\nGetting turned on at the two of us playing together, Jeffrey came over\nto the couch we were on and pulled down his sweatpants revealing his\nerect manhood. All of the laughter stopped, now it was time for work.\nPushing my head into his pubic region I had to give into his perverted\nwants. Ghislane started to undress me. Once I was bare she loved starting\nwith my breasts. She cupped them in her hands and brushed her fingers\nover my hardened nipples heading downwards pressing her lips deeply\ninto my skin, I had to maneuver my body on the couch in a complex\nposition to give them both what they wanted. And just like that, without\neven a moment' s notice I could be put on the spot and have to amuse\nthem in any way they wanted. A shameful way to make someone feel like\na used toy, I wasn' t around for companionship I was there for one thing, I\nwas a compliant piece of eye candy.\nTwenty minutes later and Jeffrey had erupted in pleasure. Ghislane sat\nup, still fully dressed, and wiped the sides of her mouth with her hands,\ngiving a vindictive little chuckle, \" That was fun.\" Jeffrey concurred with\na sly grin arching his back for a stretch just looking able to utter the\nrequest \" Why don' t you come tip with me upstairs for a steam bath and\nmassage, I need to be loosened up after that?\" It was more of a statement\nthan a request, as if I had the choice to say \" No thanks, I' m actually tired\nmyself and would love to just relax\" instead I would reply with my\naccustomed trained obedience, \" No problem, when your ready lead the\nway.\" I had to get dressed again being that we were in Ghislane' s\ndownstairs office. Putting my clothes back on, Ghislane thought she had\nbuttered him up just where she wanted him to ask for him to come have a\nlook at her new townhouse renovations when he was finished with his\nmassage. A very strange relationship those two have, there' s a definite\nlove flowing between them but not a passionate one, more like a\nrespectful business, he gets what he wants ... an uncountable number of\ngirls and she gets what she wants, simple and sweet ... an uncountable\namount of money. The two things in life that can create such beautiful\nmoments or the most horrendously terrible of them all, is sex and money.\nChapter 15\nI joined him for a shower, steam bath and concluded his needs with a\nmassage while listening to classical music. 1 knew he didn' t want\nanything sexual from me now seeing he got what he already wanted\ndownstairs, no this one was purely therapeutic. My favorite massages to\ngive, making me feel like an actual real therapist. I lathered him in\naromatic oils and let my hands discover the ways to unlock the stresses\nthat his body held. After the massage was concluded we were going\ndownstairs to get ready to go see Ghislane' s townhouse as he had\npromised her earlier. He loved taking the hidden staircase while 1 hated it.\nI was so creeped out by his choice of decor, the blood red carpets, violent\nmedieval paintings, and sculptures of the pagan god Pan, all of it\nrepresenting the darker side of hedonism his lifestyle provoked. Spiraling\ndown the hallway along with each step you took came with a pair of eyes\nthat followed your every step. Brown, blue, green, hazel, all of the colors\nwere there, staring at you the entire way down. As each step progressed,\nSO would my anxiety to get out of there.\nWe found Ghislane where we had left her, in her office. She had just\nreceived an order in, a satellite camera with a twelve -inch flat screen. She\ntold us how it was used to pick up any person in any location with the\nquick insert of an address. Quite a powerful new toy I thought, but it was\nonly a minute display of what the rich could afford, what use they would\nget out of it was another concern. Soon after she was done figuring out\nthe controls on the camera, we made a rare and first for me pit stop, the\nsecurity room. What I thought was our way out by the front door was\nanother hidden door. I was in shock as I was led into a room, so discreet\nthat in three years I never even knew it existed. I kept my head down\nmost of the time, knowing how secretive this must be being another door\nwas an entire security base within his mansion. What 1 could see when 1\nstole a glimpse here and there was an array of tiny screens, twenty odd or\nsomething. Small screens showing various rooms of the mansion I had\nrecognized. The images were constantly changing sol found it hard to\npinpoint an exact location but from the decor and short glimpses i\nsuddenly knew from then on that my feelings of my every move being\nwatched inside his corridors was now more than apossibility but was\nactually happening. Jeffrey spoke to an obese Spanish guy at the desk,\nwhose job was to disgustingly overlook all of the video feedback. Kill\ntwo birds with one stone Jeffrey thought, free porn to share with all of his\npedophile friends and when the occasion called for it, a security system\nall at one expense. Ever consumed with making money as well as saving\nit, I was again astonished at Jeffrey' s capabilities. 1 didn' t want to even\nthink how deep the video infiltrated, pretending like I never saw anything\nat all I put the memory to the back of my mind and went on about my\nday. Stopping at Ghislane' s new townhouse, another gift bought and paid\n93\n94\nF Copyright Protectod Matc, ml\nCopyright Protected Malarial\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004226 CONFIDFNCIAL GIUFIRE004227\nfor by Jeffrey, he pointed out needed changes all over the place, driving\nthe builders mad, as always. He wanted the place to scream out\nGHISLANE\" with a bold statement. Checkered floors and bold colors\nwas the theme, like the queen of hearts from Alice in Wonderland, very\nwell suited I thought.\nThe dust from the walls being torn down chocked my throat and the\nelevator was not in use, the stairs were hardly either. The whole house\nwas in bad shape then having to go up three flights of rickety steps was a\nbit of a risk too but worth it once you made it to her future walk in\nwardrobe or to us commoners, a closet the size of a small a house.\nComplete with a dressing room, luxurious bathroom and plenty of storage\nfor her every ensemble. Even without it being finished it was already a\nwork of art, a sanctuary for any woman. She adorned herself in her future\nhome, finally her own, relishing every inch of it, she already put in a\nwork desk and spoke constantly of its ongoing renovations. About an\nhour later we were off to pick out curtains and look at some paint samples\nat a couple different boutique looking shops. Easily passing off as an\nordinary couple for the day, they walked arm in arm strolling the streets\nof the Upper East Side. Except to me, still replaying the early afternoon' s\nevents, shaking my head over the echoed images in my mind, I followed\nbehind just waiting to be needed again.\nOver the course of the next few months was a constant influx of\nexorbitant excursions at Jeffrey' s mansions, mainly to his island, to keep\nLIP with his ever -demanding sexual appetite with various young women\nand teenage girls. I got back on the Xanax, an old habit that I felt at the\ntime would stop my memories from flowing back, rehabilitate my\nproblems and relax me enough to deal with any situation at hand, no\nmatter what the circumstance revealed itself to be. It was a drug that\nwould blind my eyes to everything I should' ve been running from.\nHaving Brunel always in the picture these days wasn' t helping me at all\neither. Sending his girls for Jeffrey at all of his places now and at a\nvigorous flow, they had an abundance of girls at their disposal. If I were\nto count one girl for everyday of the week, it would be the\nunderestimated statement of the century. So many girls between the two\nof them, some nights it would be a free for all frenzy for Jeffrey and\nBrunel, seven or so girls giving them their upmost attention, doting on\ntheir every moan and whimper, Jeffrey being the main concern since\nBrunel worked for him and we were all aware of that too. If there were\nheaven on earth for men like Jeffrey, than he would be their God. Every\none of his inner most desires was fulfilled when his harem of women was\naround. No wonder he didn' t travel much abroad these days, all he ever\nwanted was right at his doorstep. I couldn' t believe that he was still\nasking me to bring girls to him as well. There was never enough girls to\nfill his appetite, so on occasion I would meet a pretty girl around my age\nand invite her back to his place to make some quick money by offering\nher a really good contact in the modeling and acting business. Keeping\nhim satisfied and in need of me was a tiring job. With so much\ncompetition I had to be on the ball, seeming ambitious to grant him all of\nhis desires. It was a lot of pressure and a spotlight of a role to undertake\nat such a young age but I told myself this is what my life' s training had\nled me up to be.\nMy Birthday was around the corner and turning eighteen had lost all of\nits sparkle and pizzazz. There were no more surprises in store for me,\nnothing that would bedazzle me I hadn' t done already. I spent my\nbirthday on the island, having a quiet dinner and watching \" Sex and the\nCity\" on the couch with Jeffrey, Ghislane and Emmy. There was no cake\nor a celebration of any sort but I did get a couple of presents that I opened\noutside underneath the main cabana. Jeffrey gave me a beautiful pair of\nsapphire and diamond encrusted earrings and Ghislane bought me another\ndesigner makeup case. I thanked the two of them with a tight squeeze and\na gratuitous short spiel. As it went quiet, I looked out to the ocean and\nwondered if across these waters was there ever going to be happier days\nspent with someone special to me. Would he be kind, compassionate, and\nalways be there when 1 needed him most? Or would 1 end up settling for\nmy final bit of training, a marriage to a greedy old scrooge? Either way\nwhat I wanted most didn' t matter right now, I was still bound by Jeffrey' s\nhold over me and all I had to keep telling myself to get through this epic\njourney was, this is just the way it was for now.\nAround the table for breakfast Jeffrey announced that he was expecting\na few guests coining over with Brunel, no one of importance, just his\nusual entourage of beautiful girls. Russian models this time and Jeffrey\nwas also having a photographer flown in to take modeling photos using\nthe island as the perfect background for a sexy shoot. All of us girls were\nushered onto rocks, hammocks, dug into sand and displayed just about\nanywhere they wanted. We were being photographed in next to nothing,\nlike a netted fabric placed over us if the shot called for it, but the more\nprovocative the more Jeffrey and Brunel loved it.\nAfter the photo shoot we did some outdoor watersports. While us girls\nraced the jet skis around and jumped on the water trampoline, the men\nstayed on dry land to watch us from the beach. I was so used to this\nconstant charade of girls and I didn' t mind having a bit of fun but this\nwas different, I had to be more than just polite because I already knew it\nwouldn' t be long before we were all intimate with each other as well.\nBeing the only girl that spoke English out of all of them was also a huge\nblunder. The only way we could communicate was through hand gestures\n95\n96\nIl Copyright Protcctod Mato—I\nCopyright Protwtad Matonal\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004228 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004229\nand body language, a very primitive form of speaking, but what choice\ndid we have?\nI did my best to get acquainted and as I had previously assumed after\nlunch on the beach we were again ushered into another part of the island,\nJeffrey' s cabana. There was no need for words here, as the girls already\nknew exactly what to do. Without saying anything they undressed me and\nbegan to ravage my body with their hands, tongues, lips and fingers. I\nwas delirious, never having done anything like this before with so many\ngirls. It was sheer chaos; I don' t honestly know how men could fantasize\nover this. Through the glimpses in between bodies crossing over me 1\ncould see Jeffrey and Brunel watching us, sitting in a chair with their\nhands around their penises, stroking themselves together \" The best part is\nthey don' t even speak English so there' s never a need to have to keep\nthem amused\" I could hear one of the men divulge and pretty sure it came\nfrom Jeffrey laughing out loud to Brunel. I just closed my eyes and went\nsomewhere else in my mind until it was all over. That was that, life went\non and we all moved on to eat dinner together.\nIt couldn' t be more awkward as Jeffrey and Brunel were beside\nthemselves with their ego' s beaming, and the girls chatted like busy little\nchipmunks with each other. Ghislane and Emmy on the other end of the\ntable were being amused at the entire racquet around the table and then\nthere was me. Sitting quietly and smiling in people' s direction when\nneeded, I was counting down the minutes until I could go lay down in my\ngiant comfortable bed, slipping away to the gentle noises the island\ncreated and sink comfortably into a deep sleep with the assistance of my\nXanax. Scratching at the plate in front of me with my fork out of\nboredom, I wasn' t even hungry. I had lost my appetite for food. Rather\nsipping on the champagne I wanted to feel as far away from here as\npossible. What seemed like hours for everyone to finish their meals we\nwere finally all saying goodnight and goodbye to each other, as Brunel\nwas off early in the morning and taking the eight beauties with him.\nThank God\" I told myself, once was more than i could handle of that in\none day.\nIt didn' t take me long to get back into my own comfort zone. Heading\nstraight back to my cabana after dessert was served nearly tripping over\nmy own two feet as I tried to scuttle off in a hung. As soon as I entered\nmy domain, I drew a breath and sighed a deep exhale outwards, finally\nalone and at peace... for now at least. Although the sun had set hours ago\nthe high temperatures of the Caribbean were still an affliction, plaguing\nmy cabana I was welcomed by a rush of warns air as I opened the door. I\nhit the switch to the fan and stripped down for a shower. Preparing my\ntowel and toiletries I opened the back door to the outside shower and\nplaced them on the floor. Whether I was cleaning up in the midst of a hot\nday or retiring for the evening, an outside shower was always splendid.\nUnder a thick dark cloak of the night sky only the moon and stars to shed\nenough light for me to see my way around. I could feel the soft breeze\nlick the droplets falling off of my bodies' curves in the reflection of the\nmoonlight. It only encouraged me to stay longer under the warmth from\nthe spray of rushing water. I let the hot water nm out before I was\nsufficed enough to go back inside. Lounging around the bed in my\npanties and a tank top I was still sweltering from the heat. Trying to tire\nmyself out, I did some reading and eventually fell asleep. 1 needed those\ntimes to unwind after such an ordeal, letting the Xanax wash away all of\nthe pain I could then forgive the mistakes 1 had made, blaming myself for\nstaying around for this I had wished I was never born at all. The pills\nwould take all of that away for me. My heart was a tangled weave of\ndeception and pain, only reassured by the lies that were told to me and the\nlies 1 would have to convince myself of.\nChapter 16\nWhen we flew back into Palm Beach, Juan drove me back to my\napartment. Lonely for some companionship I decided to call an old\nfriend. I was longing to be important to someone and unfortunately with\nsuch little time to have a social life of my own 1 was compelled to call T. J\nagain. His Mom answered the phone and sounded quite surprised to hear\nmy voice on the other end. She was always kind to me, I even used to\nbring her back \" Cola\" cans from other countries a bizarre hobby she\nloved collecting. She just didn' t know what I saw in her son, even saying\nthat to his face many times over. Not blind to his ways of cheating and\nstealing, being a personal victim of it, she made it apparent that she did\nnot approve of TYs choice in lifestyle. It used to really hurt him how his\nparents thought so badly of him, so he gave up trying to earn their love a\nlong time ago. As long as he didn' t steal from them anymore he was\nallowed to live there. Instead of that being a lesson to him, he would just\ntry to be more clever in what he would steal, less obvious things. He\nwould steal the toaster and sell it for five dollars if he knew it would help\nto get him his next high.\nNonetheless and at my expense I had a sweet spot for him. With\nenough water under the bridge, I was able to forget about the troubles he\ncaused. His Mom told me she' d pass on the message when he got home,\nbut that could be days from now. The last time he had been home was\nover a couple of weeks now. He only stopped by to get something to eat,\nhave a long sleep and to beg her for a few bucks, supposedly to help him\nbuy food. Then he was off again without a single word said, only leaving\n97\n98\nP Copyright Prorecmd M--] -\nCONFIDENTIAL\nCopyright Protected M- 61\nGIUFFRE004230 CONFIDENTIAL GIUII RL004231\nhis parents to their own assumptions, which were pretty much correct\nanyways.\nI then called around a couple of mutual friends to see if anyone had\nheard from him. Everyone I spoke to pointed their fingers in the same\ndirection and the worst place possible, Ritchie' s house. One of his best\nfriends told me of how bad he was doing, \" He' s not the same guy\nanymore, and all he cares about is the next high he gets. If we don' t get\nanything for him he just loses it and goes off somewhere.\" It was hard to\nhear how badly affected my best friend was and a part of me secretly\nhoped they weren' t right. Still defending him, 1 told everyone I had spoke\ntoo while trying to find him that TJ would be fine, he' s just probably\ngoing through a bad phase, like we all do sometimes and needs people to\nhave his back more than ever now. I was pretty much laughed at on the\nspot, most people that I considered my friends at the time were only\nfriends by association_ As long as we all looked the part, acted the part,\nand could handle the part, only then did they want to be around us. The\nlast person I called was the last person I had hoped he wasn' t with and it\nturned out that everyone was right.\nHe was with one of the biggest Coke dealers in our area, Ritchie -Rich,\nas everyone used to call him. He didn' t look like a typical strung out\njunkie or dealer. Instead he looked like your average preppy college grad\nwith aspiring propositions. He dressed well and acted like a nice guy to\nimminent clients only to get them hooked on his drugs and then turns\nthem out onto the streets. He was a businessman and his business was\nthriving. He carried everything from most drugs to guns and knives.\nHaving ears in all places made him a dangerous acquaintance. Using kids\noff the local Palm Beach streets to run his dirty errands and the errands of\nthe others above him, he made his money by using these teenagers, who\nas hard as it was to believe was once somebodies sweet child.\nI knew TJ didn' t have the finances to support himself or his drug habit\nso the likelihood of him being indebted to Ritchie in other ways was a\nsafe assumption. Obtaining Ritchie' s number from one of T.J' s friends\nMarcus he asked me, \" What do you want to call Ritchie for? Come over\nto Try place and I can get you whatever you want\" Marcus was a sleaze\nbag who would tirelessly continue to try to appeal to my lesser sense of\njudgment, never getting the hint or just not caring that I could never and\nwould never be interested in him. \" No Thanks Marcus, can I just get the\nnumber please, it' s very important that I get ahold of TJ, I' m really\nworried about him.\" I hated having to call this guy let alone have to ask\nhim for something. \" Is this about the Adam bullshit? Cause if it is you\ncan let him know what a fucking bitch he is for not showing up to be\nthere for him, you can tell him from me that it' s his fault and it should' ve\nbeen him that' s lying in the morgue now, not Adam\" I was totally thrown\nby his allegations 1 could only mutter out a whisper \" Did youjust say that\nAdam is dead, what happened?\" \" Oh snaps, I thought you knew, where\nhave you been girl, under a rock or something?\" Marcus was less than\nsensitive about his statements. \" He got shot in the head by two black guys\nwho got suspicious when their usual supplier didn' t show up, your boy\nTJ was so fucked up he didn' t even remember to turn up at Ritchie' s for\nthe delivery, so Ritchie sent Adam alone and now he' s dead.\" Adam was\na sweet kid who just happened to be born living on the wrong block. Best\nfriends with TJ since childhood, the two were inseparable until puberty\nhit and even then they would chase girls together. Adam followed in T. J' s\nevery footstep, mimicking his shadow, if TJ jumped off the Eifel Tower\nthen so would Adam so when TJ got hooked on drugs consequently\nAdam did too, leading ultimately to his death. Wanting to end the\nconversation with Marcus quickly 1 scribbled down the phone number on\na blank piece of paper in front of me and hung up the phone to call\nRitchie' s place immediately.\nYeah?\" It was Ritchie whom bluntly answered the phone after the first\nring. \" Hi —Uh- Rich, It' s Jenna, T.J' s ex, we met a couple of times at a\nfew parties\" I was trying to remind him of who I was knowing how\nparanoid he was about people having his number. \" Oh yeah, I know who\nyou are, what is it you want?\" He answered with a dry tone. \" I was\nhoping you could tell me where I could find TJ, I' ve heard some stuff\nand am really worried about him, is he alright?\" Ritchie snickered at my\nconcerns. \" What are you his Mom or something? He' s fine, lie should be\nback here around five o' clock, I' ll tell him you called.\" In the middle of\nme saying \" Thanks and good-bye\" he hung up the phone, as there is no\nroom for manners in his line of work. I waited until five o' clock watching\nthe minutes on the clock tick past and when five o' clock came and passed\nby with still no phone call, I couldn' t deny to myself that I wasn' t\nstricken with distress. Falling asleep wasn' t easy either. I ended up\ncrashing out on my sofa watching T.V, half expecting to hear of another\nmurder on the news and it being T.J.\nForgetting to put on my eye mask before I went to bed, I was woken up\nthe next morning by rays of the sun beaming into my living room. When I\nsleep I am a creature of darkness, avoiding any window light at all costs.\nStaggering to the coffee pot not used to getting up this early, my first\nthought that day was TJ and why he hadn' t called. A million thoughts\nrushed through my head like a steam train ... is he ok? Is he not calling\nbecause he is still mad from our last breakup? Has he moved on to\nsomeone else? Is he in any trouble? Did Ritchie even pass on my\nmessage? The thoughts were an endless infliction, consuming my entire\nday.\n100\nU Copyright Protected Material\nU\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004232 CONFIDENTIAL GIUPIRE004233\nUntil finally he called my cell phone later in the afternoon, relief swept\nover me when I heard his voice on the other end. \" Thank God you called,\nI have been so worried about you, are you alright?\" I jumped in without\nletting him get past saying \" Hello\". \" Yeah, I' m fine. Ritchie told me you\ncalled his house looking for me yesterday and gave me shit for it saying\nyou were upset or something, what' s up?\" I knew I would have to be\ndelicate about asking what happened to Adam, thinking he' d be a mess\nover it. \"I heard from Marcus that something happened to Adam and I got\nworried about you, what is going on?\" T. J sounded scared, for what\nreasons were beyond my knowledge but I was going to find out, he\nreplied \" 1 don' t want to talk about it over the phone. Are you in town so\nwe can meet up or something?\" It was obvious I wanted him to know that\nI was more than willing to lend my shoulder for his problems. \" I' m home\nnow if you want to come over whenever you feel like it.\" He didn' t\nhesitate in taking me up on the offer. \" But 1 won' t be able to get there\nuntil later, I' m downtown at Ritchie' s place unless you want to come pick\nme up.\"\nIt was more of a request than a favor to myself which is what he was\nmaking it out to sound like, knowing him all to well I didn' t make a fuss\nof his ill -contemplated attributes. I got the address off him and made my\nway into the ugliness of the not so dazzling parts of the Palm Beaches\ndowntown area. Rolling up my windows and locking the doors to my\ntruck I nervously drove through the rough streets trying to find Ritchie' s\napartment complex. Knowing all too well the history of the area, it' s not a\nplace a lone white girl in a nice truck wants to be seen, many reports of\nthe locals rushing up to a vehicles with a weapon demanding money,\ncars, or just angry and out to hurt someone. I was speeding through the\nstreets wanting to get out of there as quick as I could. A sad world we live\nin with so much hurt everywhere you look and nobody wanting to do\nanything about it, just accepting the hopelessness of never being able to\nachieve anything more than what our civilization has succumbed to.\nBeing among one of those people, we were similar in so many ways.\nOnly separated by our own personal fears and the different direction they\npulled us into.\nI drove straight through the open gates at the entrance to the complex\nand parked on the gutter in front of Ritchie' s block of units. A crowd of\npeople stood outside the blocks I was entering. Being hit on and offered\ndrugs simultaneously my cheeks went flush and I put my head down not\nsaying a word. Walking up the corridors of the staircase looked like a\nscene out of a horror flick. Graffiti covered the peeling of green paint on\nthe walls and the pungent stench of something rotting, only to the worst\nof my imagination, filled my nostrils. I could hear babies screaming\nthrough the thin walls and trying to find the unit number was difficult\nfrom the sporadic flickering of the fluorescent lights above me.\nAt last I found Ritchie' s one, quite astonished with myself that I even\nmade it this far. I had to knock loudly on the door a few times before a\nyoung girl answered the door with eyeliner bleeding down from her eyes,\nher jet black hair was strung out and a mess and she looked off her face\non some hard drug. She had only her bra and a short skirt on to cover her\nprivate areas and a cigarette hung out of her mouth to complete the full\npicture of terrible state she was in. She looked me down with contempt\nand snubbed at me \" What do you want?\" I maintained my politeness and\ntold her T. J was expecting me. She opened the door and walked away,\nleaving me by myself to venture through looking for T. J.\nPassing through the kitchen it looked like a hospital lab with syringes on\nthe counter tops and medicine containers lying around everywhere.\nMinding my steps through the dirty house, I walked to the back to the\nliving room and found T.J in a K -Hole strung out on a filthy couch.\nHey ... there\" he acknowledged me with a giant smile spread across his\nface. He probably didn' t even know who I was from the dreadful state he\nwas in. My first look at him in months and I was in utter shock. My jaw\nmust have dropped to the floor at the very sight of him. Never seeing him\nso skinny and unhealthy looking I took pity and wanted to help him\nbefore things got even worse and he ended up like Adam, dead.\nT. J, hey buddy its Jenna, remember I was coming to pick you up\ntoday. You don' t look so good, what are you doing so messed up?\" I\ndon' t think he could even understand what I was even saying because he\ncould only reply by giggling and rolling over, patting the couch as if it\nwere a fluffy animal. I stood over him now and raised my voice so he' d\nknow 1 was serious and snap out of it a bit. \"Get Up T. J, Now!\" I ushered\nat him to get off the couch, repeating myself a few times over and with no\nresponse I knew I had to get physical. Rolling him back over to face me\nagain I smacked his face hard and I' m sure it stung but I got the reaction I\nhad wanted. He sat up and looked at me confused.\nAt least now he was able to focus on my words requesting him to come\nwith me. He was getting up from the couch and stumbling around before\nfalling down to the floor again. Putting his arm around my neck and\ncarrying the majority of his weight, I helped him up many times over and\ndown three flights of stairs into my truck and drove him back to my\nplace. It was a triumph on it' s own arriving downstairs in one piece.\nBeing the only person who really cared if T.J lived or died I felt like the\nresponsibility of helping him was my concern alone.\nThankfully Jeffrey was in Palm Beach for the next couple weeks\nentertaining royalty, which gave me a little time to try and clean T. J tip. I\ncalled a few of his friends that I knew and asked them not to score any\n101\n102\nJ Copyright 1' rotootod Material Copyright Protected Material\nCONI' IDLN'rUA GIUFFRE004234 CONFIDENTIAL GI1JFFRL004235\ndrugs for him any more, pleading with them and telling all of them he\nwas on the brink of death, reminding them of the friendship between us\nall that once existed before the drugs corrupted so many of us. Some of\nthem laughed at me telling me I was wasting my time with T. J and others\nwere nice enough to at least lie to my face politely and promise not to\nhelp him feed his addiction.\nI just wanted to remedy all of his pain and problems but I felt so\nhelpless fighting his battle against the streets. I bought some marijuana\nfor him to smoke hoping to subside the withdrawals he was facing over\nthe next few days but with no avail. The only thing that would help him\nwas my Xanax, a few of those pills and he would go back to sleep, only\nwaking up to get more of them. I would have to force him out of bed to\nhave a shower once a day and make sure he ate something. He was more\nlike a baby right now than he was a boyfriend, too much in need of\nsomething I couldn' t give.\nChapter 17\nWhen 1 went to see Jeffrey over the next course of days he picked out\nthe dilemma I wore spread across my face straight away. \" Your back with\nT.J aren' t you\" It was so funny that he knew me so well. \" Yeah, he' s in a\nreal bad place in his life right now and needs my help.\" He looked\nastonished and replied, \" You' re a much better friend than I am, I know\npeople like him and trust me they never change, no use in even trying\" I\nbelieved him too knowing I was stupid for even attempting to change T. J,\nbut my heart felt differently, he was still a human being and a good friend\nof mine just down at his worst. \" That' s what good friends are for\" I\nlaughed back at his remark, not wanting to take this conversation too\nmuch further. \" I admire your loyalty at least, but take my word for it, he\nwill hurt you again.\" His words were chilling but true, I had to find out\nfor myself though.\nAlmost seeming like an actual friend for a second he ruined his brief\nmomentary image by turning over from the unfinished massage that I was\ngiving to him and acquired his sexual longings from my worn down soul.\nNot only did he know that I didn' t want to endure any more demands\ntonight, but his energy enhanced from knowing it too. Looking up at him\nduring the foreplay, it was an easy observation from the took in my eyes\nthat I hated every minute of it, seething through all of my duties until he\nclimaxed.\nMost days I could take this kind of treatment, it was only seldom I\ncouldn' t hold in the way Jeffrey disregarded my feelings. He had me just\nwhere he wanted me, like a pawn piece on a checkers board I was his\nown personal sex slave. For the remainder of the evening I stayed quiet,\nnot sure of what to say after an episode like that. It was a vigorous\ndisplay of how calumniating he could really be. He required me to clean\nup his spilled semen off of his genitals with a wet warn washcloth before\nhe retired to his bedroom for a good night' s sleep. Only a monstrous\ncreep could sleep easy at night knowing what pain he caused others.\nI went downstairs and asked Juan, who was still in the kitchen to pay\nme for the evening telling him that Jeffrey had gone to sleep for the night.\nIt wasn' t an unusual request. Juan would often have to fix up \" the girls\"\nafter the sessions and sometimes even drive them home. He went to\nJeffrey' s desk and underneath was his duffel bag that always held\ninsurmountable bundles of crisp hundred dollar bills. He took out two for\nme and handed them over. I thanked him and said goodnight, as I was\nalways polite to Juan and his wife, Maria. His eyes were gentle and told\nme more than what he was allowed to say. I understood well. We all\nneeded to eat and pay bills unfortunately even sometimes at our own\nmoral expense.\nPutting the keys into the ignition I started up the engine and reversed out\nof Jeffrey' s driveway with promptness. I didn' t want to be there a\nmoment longer than I had to. Not much to look forward too getting back\nto my apartment either, I needed some time to filter my emotions.\nParking my truck in front of a nearby beach I took my shoes off gradually\nstepping out of the door into the fog. I walked down to the edge of the\nsand where the water licked at my toes. My life was slipping away from\nme and I was really beginning to question the difference between living\nand dying. I was so tired of everything, my whole existence revolved\naround being everything to everyone, forgetting about being something\nfor myself altogether. Pretending to be someone else became an attribute\nI was better than good at, probably much of why Jeffrey liked me in the\nfirst place. This time I held back my tears back and only let the anger\nfester into a deep pit in my stomach. My rage was aimed at the very\npeople who abandoned me to fend for myself in the first place and\naccepted this life as normal for me, my parents.\nWhen 1 got back to my apartment I was expecting to have to look after\nT. J, but to my surprise he had come around good that night. He greeted\nme at the door and asked how my evening was. \" It was all fine\" I easily\nlied. I never let anyone inside close enough to see my vulnerabilities.\nThey were mine alone to battle. In my head they were too shameful to\n103\n104\nI Copyright P --, d Material li Copynght Protected Material\nCONI' IDENTIAL GIUFFRE004236 CONFIDENTIAL ( AUF 81,004237\ntalk about anyways. He wanted to talk about something else anyways.\nSitting me down at the dining room table he began his spiel. \"\nI know you\ndon' t think much of me anymore, how could you? I' m a junkie who\nsteals and sells drugs for a living, but I promise that' s all going to change\nnow. Adam is dead because of me and the only way I can make it up to\nhim is to get away from it all. I promise things are going to get better.\" It\nwas a convincing talk, but I knew him all too well. His demon inside\nyearned for him to fail but who was I to second-guess him out loud, I\ncould only try to give him hope. \" No one is perfect T.J. At least you' re\ntrying now and that' s all that matters to me. I am so proud of you.\" I gave\nhim a sincere hug and kissed him for the first time in a long time, \" I love\nyou,\" he said to me and I returned my love back. We slept in the same\nbed together that night and were officially back on together.\nTwo days later I was gone again, beckoned to be in Santa Fe. Ghislane\nonly told me that I was to meet someone there, not sure of whom that\nwas. It wasn' t my place to ask questions. As far as I knew it could be\nanyone and I had no choice but to be compliant to their needs. It was the\nmiddle of the day when I arrived at the airport. One of the ranch hands\ncame to pick me up in a big work truck that smelled like dirt and sweat\nbut I didn' t mind that' s what I loved about the countryside.\nWhen we arrived at the mansion my guest was already there waiting for\nme. I couldn' t wipe the look off my face as he turned around from the\nbookshelf that he was standing at. \" Hello\" that same old cheesy grin\ngreeted me once again. It was his highness Prince Andrew, and what a\nsight. He wrapped his arms around my waist and greeted me like an old\nfriend. I hugged him back rolling my eyes at the same time, already\ndreading what lay in store over the next couple of days. My job was to\nentertain him endlessly, whether that meant having to bestow him my\nbody during an erotic massage or simply take him horseback riding. For\nthe next couple of days he was to be my only concern, but he wasn' t. I\ncalled in checking on T. J a few times a day, not wanting to be a nag but\njust hoping he hadn' t had any thoughts about relapsing. He was doing\ngreat, even applying for a couple jobs. Being reassured by him made my\ntime away less complicated and thankfully with the help of my ever -\nready Xanax I was able to cope with the ordeal.\nThe mansion was completely empty save a couple of maids who also\ncooked our dinners for us, and a couple bodyguards that we hardly even\nsaw at all. The time dragged by slowly for me as I was counting down the\nhours until l flew away again, anywhere but here I thought. It wasn' t easy\nmeeting the sexual desires of these strange men, the Prince being one of\nthem. He loved my feet and even licked in between my toes. Then there\nwas the lack of passion in the intimacy we shared, to him I was just\nanother girl and to me he was just another job. Not the right reasons to be\ntogether but I thought in this world and to these monsters, there didn' t\nneed to be a reason. To them it' s nothing but a reenactment of their\npersonal fantasies. To me it was a living nightmare.\nThankfully one of Jeffrey' s assistants from New York called me on my\ncell phone early in the morning on the second day to fill me in on my\nnext adventure. I had a flight booked for me to leave that afternoon to\narrive at La Guardia airport in the evening_ Even though 1 had to go back\nto yet another controlling man, I was still relieved. At least i was used to\nthe confinements of Jeffrey' s control and in some twisted way he was\nmore comforting than these strangers he sent me to. Overlooking the city\nof New York as the plane landed felt like 1 was flying from one cage to\nanother. Entrapped by falling victim to the predators that lured me into\ntheir enclosure. I didn' t know how I would ever get out again. That deep\npit in my stomach began to churn again, a physical reaction to the anxiety\nI was plagued with. Before getting off the plane I touched up my makeup\nto hide any signs of the frailty I was feeling.\nJo -Jo met me at the arrival terminal and picked up my luggage for me.\nHe never said much at all, nodding to any reciprocating conversation. I\ndon' t think he could really speak that good of English anyways. It was\nbetter for me as I preferred the quietness for the moment. He opened the\nback door for me and we headed off for my next prison cell. When we got\nto Jeffrey' s mansion on 72\"', the place looked empty. 1 walked up the\nstaircase to Jeffrey' s office and he wasn' t there. Feeling a bit hungry 1\nwalked back down to where the kitchen was. I opened the fridge and\nfound some leftovers that Adam, Jeffrey' s chef, had cooked. I loved his\ncooking, when it wasn' t filled with beansprouts and tofu. He used to\nmake me the best pizza upon request, or whenever he was cooking\nseafood, which he knew I hated. He had an honest appeal about him and\nnever even took notice when on many occasions us girls would be\nprancing around topless, sometimes even stark naked around the pool or\nbeach. He would have to serve us our meals and would do it with such a\ncasual professionalism, never making anyone uneasy at any occasion.\nHalf way through my meal the kitchen doors swung open and incoming\nwas Jeffrey and Ghislane. Choking down my bite of food down, I got up\nfrom my seat and kissed them both on the cheeks. \" Hi guys, how are\nyou?\" I greeted them and Ghislane answered for them both \" Good, good.\nSit down and finish your meal, don' t let us interrupt you.\" I hated eating\nalone in front of people, chewing food and maintaining a conversation at\nthe same time didn' t give off the best look. \" I was just finishing anyways,\ncan I get you guys anything, maybe a tea or something?\" Always playing\nmy part, another reason to keep me around I guess, I went beyond the call\nof duty and after the last period with them, I had been reminded of my\nplace. \" Yes, I' ll take a one\" Ghislane stated. \" Jeffrey how about you,\n105\n106\nCopyright Irotected Matc ial\nCONFIDENTIAL\nCopyright Protected Material\nGIUFFRE004238 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004239\nanything I can get for you?\" I asked again and he answered, \" No thanks,\nwe just ate and I' m still full\" and they sat down together on the stools at\nthe kitchen bench.\nI got out the shiny red kettle from the cupboard, knowing my way all\ntoo well around the kitchen and put it over the hot stove plate. Turning\naround to face them, I thought they were acting peculiar. \" So...\" Ghislane\nstarted the conversation, \" How was the ranch with the Prince?\" It was a\nnatural reaction for me to blush, knowing exactly what she was referring\ntoo. Keeping busy preparing her cup of tea and avoiding eye contact with\nboth of them I started to unpack the counter where I had been eating, \" I\nthink he had a really good time, he seemed relaxed during the trip and\nwhen we said good- bye to each other he gave me a kiss.\" I went on to tell\nthem what we did together \" I took him horseback riding, nowhere to far\njust around the property, um... we went swimming in the pool, and of\ncourse 1 gave him plenty of massages. He had a massage at least couple\ntimes each day really seeming to enjoy his time there.\" It' s what they\nwanted to hear, not the truth of how disgusting I had felt over the whole\nthing but they already knew the truth anyways, it' s what they had trained\nme for in the first place.\nLike two proud parents they both looked over me with such content.\nGood, you did really well\" Jeffrey complimented me. Turning around to\nthe boiling kettle, I finished Ghislane' s tea for her and the conversation\nled on to other subjects. We all ventured up to Jeffrey' s office and out\ncame the infamous duffle bag that went wherever he did. I was given\nclose to a thousand dollars for my time in Santa Fe, more than what I\nthought anybody at my young age could make for a couple days of work.\nIt was fulfilling the obscene vulgar needs of the so- called privileged that\nearned me so much.\nChapter 18\nI spent the next few days in New York, venturing out to do some\nshopping therapy. I loved the eccentric parts of the city. Every street was\ndifferent but the same energetic vibe filled all of them, animated with all\ndifferent walks of life. Hanging out at coffee shops reading the newspaper\nor a good book was a favorite pastime while in the big apple. Being close\nenough to get back to Jeffrey for when he needed me but also far enough\nto get away from all of it. Most of the day slipped by without being\nmissed and 1 made my way back to Jeffrey' s.\nMaking one last pit stop, I walked into an old bookshop to browse at\ntheir assortment of old titles. I wasn' t in any hurry so I took my time\nreading the backs of interesting looking books. I bumped into a girl\nlooking down the same aisle I was down. \" Sorry, I' m so clumsy\" she was\napologizing for my mistake. \" No, no, it was. my fault, I wasn' t looking at\nwhere I was going. I get so wrapped up with my nose in a book and trip\nover my own two feet if I' m not careful enough.\" We were both giggling\nnow and I further introduced myself to her. Her name was Valerie or\nVickie or something like that, anyways she was a student at a school for\nhairdressing nearby. Chatting away both young and similar interests in\neach other' s choice of reading we found it easy to speak with one another.\nShe wasn' t from around here only being in the city for the last two\nmonths, her parents hated her being here, but were also supportive in her\nbig decision to move from the countryside in hopes of her accomplishing\nher own dreams. Aside from not having her near them, they just wanted\nher to be happy and supported in her big decision to move to the city,\nhelping her pay some of the way.\nShe was a pretty girl with cherry red hair and soft white skin. Her long\nlegs were emphasized by the short flowery dress that complimented her\nhourglass figure. She would definitely fit the pro quo for going down in\none of Jeffrey' s little black books. Only imagining the look on his face\nupon meeting her I could already see his sly grin spread from ear to ear.\nKnowing exactly what he would do with her and the very thought of him\ntarnishing a sweet country girl such as herjust couldn' t be done. It was\nthe beginning of a turning point in my life that started with realizing I had\na choice at hand and the effect I could have on one person alone_ \" I must\nbe off, but it was really nice to meet you.\" Bidding her goodnight and\npaying for my books I turned around with one last glance over my\nshoulder and said. \" Good luck in the city!\" Leaving that bookshop was a\nsmall step in a growing abundance of larger strides to come. Turning the\ncorner onto 72\" d street I had an undeniable feeling in the pit of my\nstomach again but this time it wasn' t the familiar hurl of anxiety I was\nused too after I had done something I had wrong that I had regretted, it\nwas a new feeling of pride and inner strength. I quite liked it a lot, I held\nmy head high and smiled on the inside when Jeffrey asked me how my\nday was and what I got up to, not mentioning I had let one girl slip on\nbye.\nThe icy winter winds faded away making way for the approaching\nsunny days that blossomed the colorful shades of spring. This was my\nfavorite time of the year. Making the most use of his island we spent\ncountless days of the increasingly hot days there. A constant array of\nvisiting guests and plentiful young women to flock around keeping them\nentertained was the typical lazy afternoon on Little St. Jeffs. We ate,\ndrank, and played under the blue blanket of cloudless skies. To many this\nlifestyle could seem idyllic, unless you were like me, the one on the other\n107\n108\nG Copyright Protected Mnrerial\nCopyright Protooted Matorial\nCONFIDEN'11AL GIUFFRE004240 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004241\nside of the fence where the grass wasn' t so green. Fortunately for me and\nin some ways not, I was mostly expected to attend to only Jeffrey' s\ninsurmountable of sexual desires. Whereas the other girls who came one\nday and went the next were promised a multitude of open doors just for\nthere meager participation in sexual acts with random men, only to be\ndisappointed when they realized they were nothing more than a single\nnight out for these geriatric senior citizens who most likely due\nAlzheimer' s would sooner forget the entire experience let alone their first\nname.\nSurrounded by those in our world who many looked up too but not\nseeing them from where 1 was standing, I didn' t have the highest of\nstandards in humanity. Then I met Al Gore and his lovely wife during\none of those many weekends away in the Caribbean. I was blown away\nby the amount of attention Al doted on his wife, it was so sweet to watch_\nThey sat next to each other at the dinner table gazing into one another' s\neyes having an intimate conversation between them. Among the many\nguests visiting that night and many of them young beautiful women, not\nonce did Al' s eye' s stray elsewhere, to them they were the only ones\nthere. He was up for a presidential election that year and he definitely had\nmy vote. Anyone that could show that much devotion and passion\ntowards his loved ones could have the same devotion towards running a\ncountry, or at least I thought so. He only left his wife' s side to have a\nwalk down to the beach with the host of the weekend, Jeffrey. The\nweather was still warm in the evening when I decided to break away from\nthe idle chat around the table and take a stroll too.\nNot wanting to interrupt the conversation between Jeffrey and Al, I\nwalked in the opposite direction plucking the washed up sea shells\nimbedded in the sand along the way. I enjoyed the serenity in the solitude\nof the island. So many nooks and crannies to get lost in, I could imagine\nthat 1 actually disappeared from the entire world for a moment. By the\ntime I came back to the main house majority of the small crowd had been\nlong gone retired to their cabanas. Even Jeffrey had gone off to bed but\ntrust party animal Ghislane to still be up entertaining the remaining guests\nleft at the table, regaling her wild stories of people and places she has\nembarked on. Trying not to make eye contact as I walked past them on\nmy way back to my cabana carrying my seashells inside my curled up\nblouse, I wasn' t up for anymore pointless talking tonight. Emptying out\nmy seashells into a plastic bag, I went over my new treasures one by one.\nI loved collecting odd things, shells being one of my favorites.\nGhislane and I shared that interest together. We would enjoy walk\nabouts around the island searching for lost pieces of the remnants that\npirate' s had left behind centuries ago. It was mostly broken plates or\nsmashed glass from bottles of ale, and even occasionally getting lucky\nenough to find some old coins here and there. It wasn' t easy though, both\nloving a challenge it was perfect for us. Enduring many scratches from\nthe bushes we would be searching through and then the soar anus from\ndigging all day, but it was worth it in the end. After nearly two years of\ncollecting items and saving them, we made Jeffrey a mosaic table out of\nthe remaining pieces left from the era of the pirate' s day. Upon\ncompleting it we were both astounded in our creation, it was such an item\nof rarity and an interesting piece of work. When we presented it to Jeffrey\nhe was even impressed not only in our amazing finds but what we did\nwith them. The table became an important work of art that Jeffrey\nshowed off inside the main house' s lounge room, sparking a much\nintrigue and table conversation by many of the visiting guests to his\nisland.\nThe next morning was good-bye for most of the visitors, leaving just\nthe usual behind. Soaking in the sun and living it up in the lap of luxury is\nhow the next few weeks were spent before having to get back to the\ndredge of the city. Sometimes we' d have to go to St. Johns island for\nJeffrey to do some work in the office. It was so boring for me to sit in\ntheir listening to him on the phone or coming down on some poor\nemployee for something stupid like not answering the phone correctly. If\nI knew he was going to be awhile I would excuse myself for a bit of\nshopping. Not that the Caribbean had much to offer in the world of\nfashion but there was never an amount of bikinis one girl could own and I\nloved all the little knick knacks one could find there. Flying back on a\nprivate jet was the best part because I could transport just about anything\nI wanted back to my apartment, which was already filled with an\nassortment from my shopping ventures and collection of seashells from\nthe Caribbean.\nThe next big dinner party on the island had another significant guest\nappearance being, the one and only, Bill Clinton. He is the only president\nin the world to be dismissed from his role as a world leader because he\nwas caught with his trousers around his ankles and had the stain to prove\nit. Publicly humiliating his wife and himself he retired from his title but\nnot from his lifestyle. This wasn' t a big party as such, only a few of us\neating at the diner table. There was Jeffrey at the head of it all, as always.\nOn the left side was Emmy, Ghislane and I. Sitting across the table from\nus was Bill with two lovely girls who were visiting from New York.\nBill' s wife, Hillary' s absence from the night made it easy for his apparent\nprovocative cheeky side to come out. Teasing the girls on either side of\nhim with playful pokes and brassy comments, there was no modesty\nbetween any of them. We all finished our meals and scattered in our own\ndifferent directions.\n109\n110\nCopvnght Protected M- ­ l Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDLN I LAL 01UFFRE004242 CONFIDENTIAL CIUFFRE004243\nJeffrey wanted his evening massage before bed and Ghislane and\nEmmy went to their office to talk about something, leaving our guest of\nhonor to find company elsewhere. Strolling into the darkness with two\nbeautiful girls around either arm, Bill seemed content to retire for the\nevening. He wanted to have a hot bath before bed while I began the\nmassage in the tub. Starting with his feet and calves, he wanted to end the\nnight quickly. Never showing any restraint he sat up on the edge of the\ntub and asked me to preform on him orally. I did my job, but that' s all our\nrelationship was these days, a dreadful job. Getting it over and done with\nas quick as possible was my hope but I couldn' t let him pick up on those\nvibes, to make him enticed I had to act like his little porn star, knowing\nexactly how he wanted it. Only then would my duties be fulfilled and I\nwould be able to get back the reality of my complicated life. Before I\ncould say goodnight, Jeffrey had one more request. He wanted me to tuck\nhim under the blankets and fluff his pillows for him. Then I had to reach\nunder the covers and massage his feet while watching him fall asleep, he\neven wanted me to wait like twenty minutes or so after he fell asleep\nbefore I could leave. It wasn' t unusual for him to ask it but God I hated it,\nnever offering it I would always wait for him to request it. Once he was\nsnoring gently I wiped my hands clean of the lotion and quietly closed the\ndoors to his room. Making my way up the outdoor spiraling staircase, I\nfelt the breeze blow through my hair and looked up to the heavens. The\nstars shown so bright out here in the middle of nowhere with no big city\nlights to hinder their effect I could get lost in time staring into them. No\nmatter how far gone I really felt there was always something about a\nsimple caress from the wind or the reflection of the star sweeping sky in\nthe black glossy ocean that would always remind me of my fond love of\nnature' s blessings.\nBack in New York, there was nothing left of nature to adorn. It was a\ndwelling for those who no longer saw the use for trees without cages or\nblue skies without clouds of man made fumes and gases. Unfortunately if\nwe weren' t in the Caribbean, we were there in New York, Hardly going\nback to Palm Beach, barely even seeing my family, my dog or T. J these\ndays at all. In my parents heads I was all grown up and educated in the\nworld of wealth not needing them any longer they would just wait for my\ncall once in a while to let them know how I was doing and that was the\nextent to our restricted relationship. The road my life has led down never\nhas kept me close to home anyways so to me it wasn' t anything\nunordinary but still a sad existence to be without a family of my own. It\nwould' ve been nice to be missed though, rarely letting myself think like\nthat. No room for pity in my heart, if I did, the floodgates could open and\nI' d have enough grief in one lifetime to go around a few times that they\nwould' ve never been closed.\nJeffrey' s business was running well from the looks of his attentiveness\nthe office lie owned in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Alan\nDershowitz, his colleague in finances and personal solicitor, a bird of the\nsame feather, I had seen hanging around the island and Jeffrey' s\nManhattan mansion, more and more these days. Alan' s taste for the\nyoung and beautiful was a bias for a blooming business relationship\nbetween him and Jeffrey. After an explicit session of Jeffrey' s vulgar\npilgrimage into my body, we were interrupted by a knock at the door by\nJeffrey' s good friend, Alan. I wrapped myself up in Jeffrey' s pink bed\nsheets, which is the color preference he chose to sleep in because it\nreminded him of the same color of his own words \" Pussy\", and covered\nmy face from the unexpected intrusion. Jeffrey got up and wrapped a\ntowel around his loins and answered the door completely calm. Opening\nthe bedroom door and letting Alan inside they began to converse about\nbusiness immediately, right in front of me. Jeffrey started to tell Alan\nwhat needed to be done while he jostled some notes down quickly. I\npeeked my head from underneath the covers thinking they were too\nwrapped up in their work to notice me get up and dressed, and Jeffrey\nturned back to me and told me to just stay there this would only take a\nsecond. Going back to Alan he turned his focus back into work and\nhustled out a few more orders before letting Alan out of the door and\nreturning his attention to me.\nSorry about that, work never stops and neither will the money coming\nin. How else am I going to make a million dollars while I' m sleeping?\"\nJeffrey chuckled as he sat back down on the bed next to me. I laughed at\nhis humorous and mostly true statement, then a strand of hair fell in front\nof my face. Before I could get to it he put it back behind my ears and\nsweetly stroked my face, for a moment we just looked into each other' s\neyes and he nearly seemed almost human to me. It was bizarre how he\ncould be so kind and gentle one moment and the second beforehand I was\nbeing treated like no more than a common plaything left out for display.\nNothing more than an ego trip, Jeffrey got off on letting the ones he\nwanted to know that he could own anything and anyone he wanted in this\nworld. Maybe for a brief minute I believed the sincerity behind his eyes\nbut that vision would quickly fade away and I would be left secondguessing\nwhy I even fell for his deceitful tricks for a moment.\nJeffrey got up from the bed and asked me to join him for a shower. In\nhis bedroom, which was the entire top floor, he had a glass shower\nenclosed underneath a glass skylight right in the middle of the room. It\nwas perfectly accessible feature for a man that loved both being clean and\nnude, but still an odd feature at that. As I always did whenever I\nshowered with him, I lathered a loofa with soapsuds and would scrub his\nbody, up and down, in between his toes, even behind his ears and of\n111\n112\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL -\nCopyright Protected Material\nGIUFFRE004244 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004245\ncourse his genitals area. The sunlight shown through the glass ceilings\ninto where we were standing, making the moment feel even more surreal\non top of the already popped Xanax I had popped before for breakfast\nearlier that morning. Jeffrey was in such a lighthearted mood that day,\nmaking funny cracks at me, and acting like a flirt. When I was finished\nwashing him he actually wanted to wash me too, which was another\ntotally out of his character suggestion.\nFor the rest of the day, he took me everywhere with him, the office and\nthen to a friends place, even just wanting to hang out with me for a while.\nI wasn' t used to being treated like anything more than a dog on a leash,\nwhen he acted like this it just completely spun me around confusing me\neven more.\nWe were spending heaps of time together these days, a lot more than\nusual. At the ranch we would do things together, alone, and not just the\nusual perverted things 1 was accustomed to doing with him alone.\nHorseback riding on his ranch during weekends away by ourselves and\nmovie nights snuggling up over a bucket of popcorn instead of having to\nmassage his feet during the entire film became his way to alter my\nperception of my original notion that I wasn' t just his sex slave, I thought\nI was finally becoming his friend.\nWhen we went quad biking he no longer wanted me to take my own\nbike, he preferred me to sit on the back of his, holding onto him tightly\nand he even tried to teach me how to drive a manual stick shift car. He\nwas definitely trying to show a softer side of himself, different to the\nstone cold slave driver I had to come to respect out of fear over the many\nyears. Still a hard image to change after all I had been through and seen\nover the years I had been with him. Nonetheless he was still my \" boss\" so\nI humored his attempts and matched his caring demeanor, giving him the\nimpression I was intrigued in our new kind of affair.\nChapter 19\nHis attentiveness led into the warmer months that commenced the\nbeginning of long summer days that I looked forward too. I couldn' t help\nbut enjoy his eagerness to see me more relaxed these days. He wasn' t\neven bothering me to find alternate sources of girls for his twisted\nsatisfaction anymore and although I was still being used for his distorted\nsexual enjoyments he further seduced me into believing I meant a lot\nmore to him than I ever did.\nIt all came to a sudden conclusion one sunny afternoon in the Caribbean.\nJeffrey pulled himself up to the ladders first step and climbed up the next\nfour steps to the top of the dock. His chest was heaving rapidly as he sat\ndown catching his breath. Ghislane was the next one up and then I\nfollowed lastly behind them. To me it was an invigorating snorkel around\nthe shallow reefs within the radius of the dock, but to Jeffrey the half an\nhour swim in the ocean was enough to overexert his ageing limbs. I took\noff my snorkel gear and placed it in the storage bench, grabbing us a few\ntowels at the same time. Wrapping a towel around Jeffrey' s backside and\nhanding one to Ghislane, 1 sat down next to them on the dock and we\nlaughed how fatigued Jeffrey was, poking fun that he really is getting\nolder. A very touchy subject for the vain at heart but he didn' t seem to\nmind it, probably knowing we' d never take the joke too far. We sat there\nin silence for a moment, an odd silence at that. Jeffrey looked at Ghislane\nand then Ghislane looked at me, placing me once again in the spotlight.\nThey both scooted closer to where I was sitting and I felt something\nstirring in the air. The biggest turning point of events in all of my time\nspent with them.\nJeffrey sat next to me and put his hand on my back and looked at me\nwith a certain kind of sincerity I hadn' t seen in him before. \" I want to\nfirst of all tell you that over the last few years you have shown me the\nkind of devotion and loyalty that I believe is rare to find among people\nthese days, qualities I hold that high in regard.\" Bewildered by the whole\nscenario I just nodded every time he paused, trying to grasp what his\nintentions were getting at. He continued to praise my nature saying \" I\nhope you know my appreciation for your embracing of my lifestyle, you\nhave been achieving a name for yourself among the friends I have\nintroduced you to. Everybody says basically the same thing about you,\nthe same thing I believe. You are a delightfully funny girl who has\ndeveloped into a mature graceful young woman and I could think of\nnobody else I' d rather have a child than with than you.\"\nAnd just like that he created a whole new dilemma for me to face. In\nutter shock from the completely unexpected proposition and before I\ncould even think of anything to respond with, Ghislane made the\nfinishing touches with the business end of the deal starting with the pros\nbefore the cons \" You would have around the clock nannies to help you.\nJeffrey would pay for a mansion of your choice in either Palm Beach or\nNew York\" and as if the drumrolls were beckoning \" and...\nyou would\nhave a hefty monthly allowance from Jeffrey' s bank account\" Astonished\nat their first offers I nearly took the bait. Then she continued to finish the\nterns of our pre -agreement with `But you would have to travel with the\nchild where and when Jeffrey wanted you to be, and most importantly\nyou would have to sign a contract stating that Jeffrey and you are not\n113\n114\nI_' Copyright Protected Materiel Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFREOD4246 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004247\nmonogamous and that the child would belong in Jeffrey' s custody in the\nevent of a falling out between the two of you.\" She kind of threw that last\none in there quickly, as if she could get away with me not hearing that I\nwould basically have to relinquish the rights to my own flesh in blood\nand surrender them to a life of servitude and abuse with these people. My\nmaternal alarm bells went off straight away and I already knew my\nanswer. No way I could I do that to any poor baby, God only knew what\nthese monsters had in store for me let alone a baby, but it was an instant\nreaction that saved me. \" I don' t know guy' s, I mean I' m really young\nand never really even thought about having kids yet. Wow, Ijust don' t\nknow.\" I slicked my hand through my hair nervously and took in a silent\nbreath. I had to go beyond what I was truly feeling and give them the\nfeeling that I' d never let them down. Putting an eager smile on my face\nand sucking up my gut' s intuition I told them \" You know what, let me get\nmy certificates in massage and have some time to prepare for this and get\nhealthy then next year we' ll all think about having a baby together.\" It\nwas crazy to even hear me say out loud but from the expressions on their\nfaces I had fulfilled their wishes.\nMuch reason to celebrate that night they were both in a cheery mood\naround the dinner table. Except for me who had taken double the dosage\nof Xanax to even cope with the high amounts of anxiety I had been\nsuffering from since we got back from the dock. I wasn' t sipping the\nchampagne that night, I was gulping it and when their moods turned from\ncheery to raunchy later that evening it wasn' t hard for me to comply.\nFrom the full effects of the state I was in I would' ve agreed to just about\nanything, allowing them to treat themselves to ravishing the tender parts\nof my body.\nOver the next few weeks everything went on as it normally would, and\nnot another mention of their proposal. My birthday was only a week away\nand I was turning nineteen that year. All I wanted was to get my\ncertificates before I got any older and get trapped into this life for good.\nWhen my big day rolled around I was in New York with Jeffrey and\nGhislane. Sitting on my bed listening to MTV' s channel blare in the\nbackground of my room I was painting my toenails when I was suddenly\nbuzzed on the intercom. It was Jeffrey calling himself to ask me to meet\nhim in his office in ten minutes. Perfect timing to let my nails dry I\nthought to myself. Already contemplating his desire to come downstairs I\nknew it had something to do with my birthday present but I was more\nexpecting the usual shopping money or piece ofjewelry, definitely not\nwhat he had in store for me.\nI knocked on the slightly ajar door to Jeffrey' s office and heard him\nbeckon me inside. \" Hello, what cha up too?\" I asked in a cutesy tone of\nvoice. Walking over to his desk he looked up at me taking his reading\nglasses off while granting me a big smile. \" Come over here and sit down\nwith me\" as he ushered me to come sit on his lap. Pulling me onto him he\nhad a funny look on his face, like he had something really big to tell me\nand was letting the anticipation build in the thickness of the silence.\nWhat???\" I laughed at the way he was looking at me now. \" First of\nall ... Happy birthday today.\" Was only the beginning of his\nannouncement and he proceeded to tell me \" I know how much you have\nwanted this for so long and you are more than deserving of it. You are\ngoing away to Thailand to learn authentic Thai Massage and within eight\nweeks you' ll receive a certificate for being a qualified Thai Massage\nTherapist.\" Astonished at his attempts to see me get what I wanted, not\nexactly the type of massage I was interested in but it was a start and a\nfirst certificate for me to acquire. My eyes lit up and I threw my arms\naround his neck, planting a big kiss on his lips, which I rarely ever did.\nWow, I don' t know what to say, this is beyond my wildest\ndreams ... thank you so much!\" I did well to let him know 1 appreciated\nhis grandeur offer. He went on to give me the details of where 1' d be\nstaying, the school' s schedules, and how much he loved Thai massage,\napparently it was the next big thing to hit the shores of America. He had\nplanned out an entire itinerary for me. I was to depart at the end of\nAugust and he had already enrolled me in a class at \" ITM Massage\nSchool\". I would only have a few days to settle in before I would be\nattending classes five days a week over eight hours a day. He even had an\nassignment for me to do while I was over there. I was to meet up with a\ngirl who was also being put up at the \" Princess Hotel\" where 1 was\nstaying. She had an Asian sounding name so I just assumed she was a\nlocal girl hoping for an opportunity of a lifetime, if she only knew what\nshe would be getting herself into. If I decided that she met Jeffrey' s\nparticular quota of approval then she would be sent over to the U. S to\nmeet with him or one ofhis esteemed colleagues. Besides the guilt of\nhaving to decide a stranger' s uncertain fate, everything else sounded\nmore than wonderful. Eight weeks gone from Jeffrey sounded like a\nlifetime away and I couldn' t be more excited at this chance. It was the\nopportunity of my lifetime and I wasn' t going to waste a second of it.\nGhislane came in a few minutes later and the look on her face told me\nshe already knew. I got up from Jeffrey' s lap and gave her a big hug and\ntold her, \" This is so nice of you guys, Thank you so much!\" She didn' t\nshare my enthusiasm of excitement. In a dull tone she responded, \" I\ndidn' t have a thing to do with it, it was all Jeffrey' s idea but good -luck\nanyways.\" She gave me her best impression of being human for a brief\nsecond and hugged me back. It was just her way and I had come to accept\nit. Depending on the level of slander her insults provoked was just her\nway of telling you she cares without really ever showing it.

Even if\nI didn' t agree with them, they knew I would for their sake of opinion.\nWhat did it matter anyways I thought, I had been degraded in every other\nphysical way what' s the difference from taking their mental abuse too.\nNot the exact choice of employers I would' ve chosen over again if given\nthe opportunity but here I was and doing my very best to excel at their\ndemands.\nI was sent home for a little over a week to pack for the long trip and\nmake the rounds visiting my family before I left overseas on my first trip\nall by myself. It was great to see my family after such a long time away.\nMy older brother and his wife even came down to visit for the well\nwishing of my departure. Everyone in my family seemed stoked at the\nprospects my long journey had led me down. Here I was jet setting\naround the world in my teens and getting paid to study the course of my\ndreams at a cost that I only knew I would have to pay. It was a wonderful\nget together with all of them around, a great way to remember them. If I' d\nonly known it would be the last time I would see any of them I would' ve\nemphasized to my brothers how much I really loved them both and how\nmuch I would miss them in the decade to come! But I didn' t know what\nmy future held for me, 1 had nothing planned out I was just hoping for the\nright opportunities.\nI also had a few good friends to catch up with before I went. Every\nnight was another party and by the end of the week I had drunken enough\nto drown an Irishman on St. Patty' s Day. I was given the lists to all of my\nfriends email address and told to keep in touch. Yeah right I thought, I\nwas going to be too busy having too much fun to be thinking about sitting\non a computer emailing people, but I told them 1 would anyways. Save\nmyself the point of having to explain that in many different ways to a\ngroup of already tipsy slurring teenagers. Out of everyone who was really\nhappy for me, T. J wasn' t. He hated the idea of me leaving him to have a\nnon- stop party in Thailand without him. He was just starting to seem like\nhe was coining good and I didn' t like having to leave him at such a\nvulnerable state but in my young years I had already realized I needed to\ndo some things for myself and this was one of them. There was still a\nhuge amount of broken trust between us, trust that could probably never\nbe rendered again so I thought I was being decent enough letting him stay\nat my apartment while 1 was gone, but he was not to drive my truck, at\nall. I paid too much money on insurance for that thing and knowing his\ndriving record I didn' t want the risk of something happening while I was\ngone for so long. He didn' t agree with me at all, throwing a grown up\ntantrum all over my apartment. Hitting the walls and doors, shouting the\nentire complex down, there was nothing I could say or do at this point in\ntime so I just put my dog on the lead and took her for a walk to calm\ndown the situation and give me some time to be alone. Mary Jane was the\nonly one I hated leaving behind. When we got back from the long walk\nshe barricaded my suitcase while I was packing the horrendous amount of\nclothing that I always did. I was promising her I wouldn' t be long and\ntold her how much I loved her giving her a big hug. I choked back on the\ntears that were swelling tip in my eyes, it was like she already knew the\nnight before I flew out to New York that this would be my final trip.\nThere was a commercial flight booked for me in the morning and I\nneeded the rest that night to fully recover from my binge of celebration\ndrinking. T.J crept into bed later that night and tried to redeem his\nbehavior with sweet nothings and dry humping my backside. It did\nnothing for me sexually. I didn' t feel like that for him any longer and the\nsooner he realized that, the better he' d be off. I told him I wasn' t up for it\nand he picked up a pillow and slammed the door behind him_ It didn' t\nmatter I told myself, the next day I was off and wouldn' t have to deal\nwith him or anyone.\nT.J caught a cab with me to MIA, the airport in Miami. He walked with\nme to the furthest point he was allowed to go by the security gates and as\nwe stood in line together it was almost heartbreaking seeing him cry. I\ntold him I' d try to call him everyday, attempting to give him optimistic\nways to look at this time away from each other. In the end he had me\ncrying and I had to give into my remaining feelings 1 had for him. One\nlast kiss under the x- ray bridge and he vanished out of my sight as 1\nfurthered down the terminals long hall.\nChapter 20\nIt was only a short flight to New York and I just couldn' t wait until next\nweek when I' d be jetting of to an exotic destination all by my lonesome\nself. It was all I could think about talk about and dream about, finally my\nbreak. Ghislane did what she did best that week and prepped me for\neverything I could imagine tinder the sun. Do' s and Don' ts, emergency\nnumbers and western union locations were among some things on the list\nshe gave me. Like I said, she showed her caring side in other ways.\nThere was also the name of the girl I was supposed to be meeting, the\nroom she was in and what dates she would be staying there.\nWhen I got out of Ghislane' s office I was instructed to meet Jeffrey in\nhis office. She had to stay back for some paper work that she had to catch\nup on pronto. Making my way up the red and gold trimmed carpeted\n117\n118\nL Copyright Protected Material\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDLN' I 1AL CIUFFRE004250 CONFIDENTIAL GIUPFRE004251\nstaircase I prepared myself for some major sucking up before I left, he\nwould be expecting it for his recent generosity, or so I had thought.\nOpening those familiar heavy doors the first thing I saw was an\nunfamiliar face standing over Jeffrey' s shoulder.\nShe was a tall girl with blonde hair twisted up in a professional looking\nknot. Her big smile was flashing at him with hints of her cheekiness to\ncome and she was dressed to kill with a short tight grey skirt and a\nmatching suit jacket over her white buttoned down blouse, revealing her\nvoluptuous ample cleavage. She looked like the old college professor' s\nwet dream. When she introduced herself to me, a thick Czech accent\npresented itself. Her name was Nadia Marcinkova and Jeffrey looked just\nabout as smitten as a victim of a love struck arrow from no one but the\ncupids themselves. Jeffrey further introduced her as his new assistant and\nmasseuse while 1 would be away, barely taking his eyes off her for one\nsecond. It was a bit of a blow to take, being so easily replaced but also a\npart of me already knew this was expected off someone like him. Good\nfor him I thought to myself, why should I have bitterness over someone I\nnever had intimate feelings for and knew had never really cared for me in\nthe first place. Kissing her on the cheeks and telling her my name, I was\ndoing my best to grin and bear it. We hugged for a brief show of\nuniformity but it was just that, a show for Jeffrey to see. When he was\naway for the moment or she wasn' t busy hanging off his every word, the\nway we all started out, she would snub me off to only head off in another\ndirection. A real bitch if anyone was to ask me but no one would anyways\nit wasn' t my job to like her.\nOver the next course of days it was my task to show her some of my\ntechniques in massaging Jeffrey and the erotic side of finishing it off.\nNadia despised me even more when Jeffrey told her to follow my lead\nduring the massage as she tried to take over and do her own thing a few\ntimes. To me it was quite funny her competitive side, I had nothing more\nto prove so watching her put on an act of seduction and scream out her\nevery body function during a faked orgasm was nothing but entertaining\nin my eyes. After a few sessions together it was my time to be off on\nanother adventure far, far away from here or from the chains that I wore\nfor way too long. Jeffrey had someone else to fit the chains that kept me\nso close to him. Even though she wasn' t the nicest of girls I still couldn' t\nhelp but feel sorry for her. No girl should belong to someone out of\nservitude, but unfortunately it is the way our civilization has been for\nmany centuries before us and I don' t see changing any time soon or as\nlong as perverts like Jeffrey are allowed to walk around freely and\nprocure our daughters off the streets all because he' s got a lot of money to\npay many, many, many people off.\nThrow out your confetti because here I come Chang -Mai!! My\ncelebrations started the second I landed, it didn' t take me long to make\nmyself aquatinted with a few fellow travelers and find the hot spots of the\nhustling city. It was like nowhere I had ever been before. The streets were\nlined with stalls offering an assortment of souvenirs, clothing, and knickknacks.\nEveryone lived so freely and was in such great spirits. The parties\nraged on until the wee hours of the morning and people became best\nfriends over night. From the second I got there I knew Thailand was\ngoing to be a lot of fun and 1 was right! Popping bottles of champagne,\ndancing all night to the beat of every club' s rhythm' s along my way and\ncarrying on like it was my birthday... every night was a repetition 1 could\ndefinitely get used too. During the day 1 was a real good girl, the teachers\npet even. Showing the credibility of my experience in massage from over\nthe last few years and already ahead of the class the teacher was using me\nto help instruct the others with demonstrations. Mostly in a class full of\nmales it wasn' t a surprise that I made friends with quite a few of them,\nsome of them with ulterior motives, but for the most part the sleazebags\nwere none of my concern, I had already dealt with a lifetime of them to\nbe able to spot one out and steer clear of his approaches. Out of the entire\nclass I had made fiends with only one girl from Wisconsin. She was a\nplain looking girl with big brown puppy dog eyes and a long drawn out\naccent. Her first time leaving the States or Wisconsin itself for that matter\nso it was easy to acknowledge that she was a little taken aback by all of\nthe bustling city life so becoming her friend felt like I was doing a good\ndeed showing her around the hot spots of the Chaing- Mai nightlife.\nEventually I even ended up inviting her to stay with me at my hotel. She\nwas running out of money to party every night then pay for school on top\nof her accommodation, it was all becoming too much out of her small\nbudget. So I thought about it and offered her a bed in my room, I had two\nof them anyways. Plus she was a really nice girl and if I could help make\nher first time out of the country an unforgettable experience then I was\nalso gaining something from it as well.\nThe first month in quickly passed me by. Having such an incredible\ntime on my own and putting my heart into learning Thai Massage it\nseemed to just fly past. Routinely I had to call in and check in with\nJeffrey and Ghislane letting them know my whereabouts and progression\nin class. Counting down the time left until my course finished Jeffrey was\nanticipating my departure back to New York. \" I can' t wait to get my first\nThai massage from you. I' ve got you booked to come straight back to\nNew York for my first one as soon as your course finishes next month.\"\nHis eagerness put a twisted familiar knot in my stomach. Reminding me\nof the dream I have to awake from soon and the reality of the certain\nhomecoming I would be arriving to. \" It' s such a great course, thank you\n119\n120\nI I Copyright Protected Material\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL OIUFFRE004252 CONFIDENTIAL GIUF171ZE004253\nso much for sending me here to learn this. You are going to love my new\narea of expertise! I am having such an amazing time over here!!\" I had to\nlet him know how much I appreciated what he had done for me and he\nloved the head swell that it would make him feel as well. Hating the\nthought of going back to him, I wasn' t going to let that put a damper on\nmy spirits while I was still out there. It was my time to party harder than\never before. Every night was a new adventure for me. Chang -Mai was a\nmaze of places to get lost in and the vibrant city was my playground. The\nway 1 saw it this was my last chance to get out and break free, letting\nloose my inner girl it felt so good to take the lead of my own life.\nChapter 21\nIt was an average evening getting ready in front of the bathroom mirror\non just an average Sunday, though unbeknownst to us girls as we sat\nthere chatting away carelessly, this night was already written in the stars\nfor me. It was a very long time ago now when I was still a young child\nthat I sat looking up to those same stars from my bedroom window with\nmy hands pressed tightly together as I cried for God to hear my prayers.\nAll I asked him for was death. My precious life was already such a\nhopeless battle that I felt too small to fight alone for. Begging him to\ndeliver me from this cruel world I would pray for all of my pain would to\naway for good. My only clause in my prayers was the possibility that\nthere was somebody in this wide world that I was meant to love,\nsomething much bigger than 1 could have even imagined yet. This\ninvocation of mine was forgotten about long ago now, until tonight -\n1 wish I had known that night I sat crying beneath the stars that it\nwould all be different one day and that I hadn' t sold myself short to the\naccustomed lifestyle I was brought up to believing was acceptable. It was\nthis night my very soul was about to cosmically collide with the man I\nwas always meant for, the man my heart already belonged to and would\nknow from the instant we met. This night would be the first day to the\nbeginning of my new life to come.\nI blushed my cheeks and put on my mascara before me and my\ngirlfriend headed out to hit the town. We were dressed to kill and looking\nfor something to do when we ran into a few of our class mates at one of\nour favorite drinking spots. They were meeting up for some drinks before\na Muay- Thai kickboxing tournament. It sounded like fun when they\ninvited us along to watch it with them. The massive crowd lined the street\nwhere the fight was being held and once I got inside the arena it was push\nand shove to try to find a spot to watch from. The friends that we were\nhanging out with were meeting up with another group of guys that were\ntraining for the kickboxing tournaments that we were watching.\nThen it happened it was the first moment I laid eyes on the man that\nwould love me for the rest of my life. I wasn' t expecting the most\namazing time of my life to happen right there and then but it did and I\nwould never be the same again. Destiny fell right smack into my lap and\nthere was no stopping it! It wasn' t just his smoldering appeal that was\nobvious at first sight it was the entire package of mannerism and chivalry\nthat made him stand out of the crowd. Stepping right out of the pages of\nthe fairytales 1 used to read, he was nothing like I had ever come to know\nbefore.\nWatching him from a close distance he was playfully shadow boxing\none of the guys from my massage class and it was at that moment that\nthis handsome stranger first caught me staring at him. From top to toe this\nathletically built man was intriguing to watch, I couldn' t take my eyes off\nhim like I was magnetically drawn to his power of attraction. He further\ninterested me when he wasn' t acting like the majority of harping dogs\nthat would jump at the eyes I was giving him now. Instead he coyly\nplayed hard to get, making me work for any conversation with him. The\nfight started and the men were going bezerk, screaming at the fighters in\nthe ring offering either fighter their support or discrimination depending\non whom they were batting for. It was like watching a primitive scene out\nof the days when the cavemen ruled the earth but it was as equally\nalluring to watch unfold, the sweat, the blood and the absolute brut\nfascination of it all.\nAfter the fight and all of the men revved up from the fight, I suggested\nthat we all head to the pizza joint in front of the Princess Hotel where I\nwas staying for a late night snack. I made it my goal to make myself\nknown to this appealing stranger. In the tuk-tuk on the way there I made\nsure I sat next to Robbie. Scooting my knees closer and closer to him on\nthe short ride he continued his chase by moving further away from me, a\ngame of cat and mouse that I Loved. When he answered back the array of\nmy questions he had the cutest Aussie accent that drove me absolutely\nwild.\nGradually we got to know each other better over a pie of peperoni\npizza and two can' s of coke. Too me he might as well have been the only\nother person in the restaurant, he knew he had my undivided attention and\nI think he liked it. There was no one like him that I had ever met before\nand I knew there was no other who could make me feel the way that 1 felt\nat the first sight of him. Being charming and suave was all an accidental\nfront. It was easy to read him. Immediately it wasn' t hard to see his sweet\nside, holding the door and pulling out my chair at the restaurant, I was\n1'21\n122\nI Copyright Protccted Mamrial Copyright Protected Matodal\nCONFIDLNTIAL GIUFFRE004254 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRL004255\nalready smitten. After pizza he walked me across the street to my hotel\nwhere we made plans to meet up again. There was no kiss goodnight or\nanything like that. No, he was too polite for that, he wanted to prove\nhimself different and different he was. Walking through the hotel' s\nrevolving doors I watched as he walked away and when he was finally\nout of sight, I sung my way up to my room. Floating on cloud nine I was\nfree falling into a deep pit of love.\nThe next day I attended my class as usual but not able to concentrate\nlike I normally did, too excited about when I' d be seeing Robbie that\nnight again. As I walked out of class that afternoon even the teacher\nnoticed a difference in my performance and asked me if I was feeling\nwell, \" On top of the world actually\" I smiled back at the old instructor\nand it wasn' t far from the exact truth either. I hadn' t ever felt the\nchurning of butterflies in my stomach and the constant thoughts of\nanyone else like this before. My girlfriend and I got a tuk-tuk back\ntogether as we usually did after school and I couldn' t shut up about the\nnight before. She was laughing at my girlishness telling me that anyone\nwho just met me would think I had never been let out before, but little did\nshe know that I had more than my fair share in experience with men and\nnever had I ever come across anyone that could make me feel this way,\nand what spun me out even more was that it was such an instant\nattraction. Never considering myself a person who believed in the\nexistence of \"Love at first sight\", but a true romantic deep at heart, I\ncouldn' t help but believe in it now. He is my walking proof of it!\nWaiting for me in the hotel lobby was the very person I couldn' t stop\nentertaining the thought of all day long, there he was looking ever so fine\nstanding in front of me now. The whole entire world faded away and all\nthat was left for the moment was this complete stranger I had only met\nlast night but somehow captivated the very essence of my very heart.\nThere was no need for me to try and act cool now. He already knew I was\nsnagged hook, line and sinker. Smiling all the way up the many stories in\nthe elevator up to my room he took notice of the posh d6cor of the hotel.\nYou should see where I' m staying, this is a royal palace compared to it\"\nHis first impression of me he automatically thought I was going to be a\nspoiled high -maintenance girl that had money coming in from a parents\nhefty trust fund. Casually he got to find out through many deep and\nmeaningful conversations that my life' s grim story wasn' t that pretty at\nall. For some reason beyond my knowledge I had the need to tell this\nstranger almost everything.\nWanting to be judged and looked down upon for everything about my\nlife that I knew was wrong and being the first time I had spoken about my\nyears with Jeffrey to anyone honestly like that ever before, I had felt like\n1 had deserved punishment. He offered me no judgment, instead only\ngave me his warmth and compassion as he wrapped his strong arms\naround me, making me feel so meager and small but so safe at the same\ntime. Encouraging me to see the worthiness of myself and leave that life\nbehind, he adorned me with a kind love that I wasn' t accustomed too.\nHe took me in and made me feel so at home. It was like I had known\nhim my whole life. I couldn' t bear to be without him another second\nwhile I was away on this dream holiday. When he wasn' t training for\nMuay- Thai tournaments and I wasn' t in school, nobody would ever see\nus. Too enveloped in each other in my hotel room to care about anything\nelse. Which is why I asked him to come stay at my hotel with me, seeing\nhe was never at his own anyways. My girlfriend was soon departing back\nto Wisconsin, making my room more than available for him. Enchanted\nby his words and tender touch, the way he made love to me was again\nlike nothing I had experienced before. Even down to after sex as 1 had\nbeen routinely instructed by Jeffrey to get up for a wane washcloth to\nclean his genitals afterwards, he refused it, telling me I was no longer a\nslave and that he didn' t want me acting like one. He' d just rather lay\ndown together afterwards and repeat our sweet nothings with many\nadjoining kisses.\nOn our third night together with nothing but the bed sheets between us,\nwe had spent all night looking into each other' s eyes sharing such an\nundeniable passion for one another. In the deepest caverns of my heart I\nknew this man would give me what I had never experienced\nbefore ... True love. We were still laying in each others arms when the\norange and pink sunrise began to rise slowly through the peak' s of my\nrooms windows, enticing me to come feel the freshness of the morning' s\nchill. Only the bed sheets were still wrapped around my body as I went\nthe balcony. It was overlooking the city in a valley surrounded by\nmountainous tops. My thoughts began to rampage through my head and 1\nknew this could only be a dream for me. It was getting serious now, too\nserious for the life that I led back home. As if he sensed my anxiety\nRobbie walked up behind me and wrapped his strong arms around my\nwaistline, gently kissing my neckline and pausing with his ever so\nthoughtful stares and gave me the exact opening that I needed to expel\nmy thoughts. \" Back home, as you already know, I am going back to\nsomeone else, it' s my job, and as much as I really like you, this guy that I\nkind of see is going to expect me to be putting him first, I am so sorry to\nsay all of this after such a wonderful few days we have spent together, but\nyou need to know this thing happening between us can' t get anymore\nserious than what we have for now. I am so sorry\" I looked down to the\nfloor with nothing else I could say to alter his perception of me now that 1\nhad told him the troth and it never dawned on me that thought he\nwouldn' t be out the door before I could even finish my sentence but he\n123\n124\nI; Copyright Protoctcd Material\nCopyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004256 CONFIDENTIAL GIUIFRE004257\ncontinued to surprise me with his efforts to make me believe we were\nmore than just friends with a summer crush. \" You see... your problem is\nthat you don' t see what I am looking at right here in front of me, a\nbeautiful girl who is completely lost in a game that she has no control\nover. Get out of it now, take my hand and follow me back to my home in\nAustralia.\" I heard what he had said but I found it hard to comprehend\nwhat he was actually talking about. \" What?\" I asked him with a look of\nconfusion on my face. \" Your nobody' s property, you can do this. Marry\nme.\" His statements got more and more profound as he went on.\nRepeating the question he got on one knee and proposed again \" Jenna, I\nam in love with you and want to spend the rest of my life making you\nhappy. Please don' t go back to him. I know that I am the only one for you\nand I will always treat you right. He paused for another second and\nrepeated his question \" Jenna, will you please marry me?\" My hands fell\ninto my face after that and without even letting myself think through the\nanswer, I let my heart do all of the talking. Looking back up at him I said\nYes!\" I almost shouted the answer at him, as if saying it louder would\ngive the word more meaning. Wanting to believe him and everything that\nhe was saying felt like a vacation from all of the suffering and loneliness\nthat I had endured over a lifetime of abuse and degradation but knowing\nwhat you want and getting it are two different things that rarely went\nhand in hand ... or so I thought. All I knew from the brief period I had\nknown this stranger was that he was offering me a life and love down an\nunfamiliar path and it was a gamble to believe a complete stranger but\nsomehow I knew he was right. My heart was beating so loud I thought it\nwas going to jump right out of my chest. With the earnestly in my reply\nhe picked me up in his strong arms and took me back to the bed and\nreiterated his words in a more physical sense this time. Never had I felt\nloved like this before, so swept off my feet and unable to even think, eat,\nor do anything for that matter which would involve leaving the hotel\nroom without him.\nEveryday after school would be my Robbie waiting to take me back to\nthe hotel room for another night' s passionate rendezvous, but a few\nnights after his proposal, he had another surprise in store. He didn' t just\nwant to get married someday. He wanted to get married now, this week\neven. I walked into the fabric store and was attended too by several\nseamstresses who were already be expecting my arrival. I was there to\ndesign and have fun designing my own dream wedding dress. While I\nwas busy picking out fabrics and having measurements taken I would\nlook away for a moment only to catch his tender eyes staring in my\ndirection. Such adoration behind his looks... could it be real? I would\noften ponder it to myselfjust hoping for the gamble I was taking to work\nout. I still had to believe in something better than what I was accustomed\ntoo and here he was right smack dab in front of me.\nGiggling at all of the lace and frills they were trying to dress me up in,\nlooking more like an antique porcelain doll than anything else I closed\nmy eyes and pictured the day that I thought would never come, starting to\nimagine the kind of dress I would like to wear I envisioned a simple\nsleekness, a complimentary figure hugging gown with a small train but\nlong enough to distinct it as an actual wedding dress. After we settled on\nwhat we were going to wear for the big day, we would next have to\ndecide where we would hold the ceremony. Not before celebrating the\nentire week beforehand though. We started our honeymoon early\ncelebrating every night spending our time between my hotel room and\nsending our heads spinning on the dance floor at many different clubs.\nOnly with each other in sight, the dance floor was ours, we were out to\ngive each other something to remember each night by. I whispered all of\nthe things I couldn' t wait to do him once we got back to the hotel room\nand watching him heat up on the dance floor I was never able to get\nenough of him driving me crazy. Like a thirst I was unable to quench, his\nlips were like a fountain of deep springs that I could never reach the\nbottom of.\nSeven days, exactly a week after his proposal l sat on my bed in distress,\ncontemplating what I would say to the man who 1 was about to call.\nThere was no nice way to go about it. 1 couldn' t last forever with him and\nthis was my one chance to get out of it for good. I was leaving him, never\nto return to him ever again. I just had to go ahead and do it. Part of me\nwas hoping he' d be at least a little happy for me and the sudden change in\nmy life' s direction but the other part of me knew I was already asking too\nmuch of him.\nCalling his office in New York I was transferred to Jeffrey' s personal\noffice. He picked up the phone on the third ring, pausing before I could\nget any of the words to come out of my mouth but I mustered up my\ncourage eventually and gave him my prepared spiel. Beginning with how\nmuch I had appreciated everything he has done for me up until this point.\nI hoped he would be understanding but he just wanted me to hurry up and\nget to the point. Trying to contagiously pass on my excitement through\nthe phone lines, I finally screamed out \" I' m getting married! Can you\nbelieve it?\" No reply was given only a silence on the other end. Trying to\nmake some conversation ridding the uncomfortable silence, 1 went on to\ntell him about Robbie and how I had fallen madly in love with him over\nthe last amazing few days we' d spent together. The absence of sound\nmade my thoughts begin to run wild and to get some response I had to\nask him what he thought about everything I was telling him. Finally a few\nseconds later his reaction to the news sunk in and his only and final reply\n125\n126\nF; Copyright Protected M- 61 Copyrisht Protected Motorial\nCONFIDLN' I LAL GIUFFRE004258 CONFIDENTIAL GIUITRE004259\nuntil many years to come was \" Have a good life!\" With that statement he\nslammed down phone receiver. Leaving only an echo of the dial tone to\nanswer back too. I was to paralyzed from the shocking response. \" What\nhave Ijust done?\" was the first thing that entered my thoughts.\nOverwhelmed with guilt I felt like I was falling down a deep and dark\nhole and then the tears began to flood in. Here I was standing at the dawn\nof a new happy life for myself and I couldn' t see past how bad I had let\nJeffrey down not yet seeing the hold he had on me.\nLike my knight on a white horse, in came my hero to soothe my\nsomberness. He rushed over to the bed where I was beating myself up\nmentally and wiped the falling tears from my cheeks. \" I take it that it\ndidn' t go so well... huh?\" Sniffling through my sobs I managed to tell\nhim that \" It doesn' t matter anymore all I care about is you and leaving all\nof that life behind me!\" 1 wrapped my arms around him and he asked me\nin a halfjoking voice \" Then why are you crying?\" He got me almost\nlaughing now too \" I guess it' s just so scary taking such a huge plunge\naway from what I' m used too and taking such a big move to another\ncountry. It' s just all so different and I' m just trying to comprehend\neverything that is happening in such a short time.\" Always out to lift my\nspirits his next comments made me gush in laughter \" You think that was\na hard phone call wait until I call my Sicilian mother! Watch this, I know\nexactly what she' ll say. First it' ll be a saga about how I' m killing her with\nmy selfish actions then it' ll be about how she' s going to kill herself for\ndoing such a terrible job raising normal children. Don' t worry though,\nshe' ll love every second of it. Wogs thrive off of the drama in their lives\nand off everybody else' s for that matter!!\" He was pretty much on the dot\nwhen he told me how she' d react to the news. In the end after relentlessly\ntrying to change his mind, she sighed, \" If it was going to be anybody to\ndo something as crazy as this, Robbie, it would be you!\" It wasn' t a\nblessing as such but at least she wasn' t threatening suicide any longer.\nCalling the closest of our families the night before our wedding to share\nwith them our announcement wasn' t celebrated by any members of either\nsides but that didn' t discern us one bit. My parents took it well,\nconsidering their only daughter was marrying a foreign man that they\ndidn' t know from the next guy on the street and too top it off I was\nmoving to Australia, permanently. When I asked my Dad many years\nlater why they hadn' t put up a fight, he just simply replied that nobody\nexpected it too last very long. Fair enough, I thought. I don' t think\nanyone did at first ... even us at our toughest times. We were a rare\nattribute these days in the numb era we have all been accustomed to\nliving in, turning nothing into something, which I had also come to\nrealize, was the most precious gift in life... Love.\nFalling asleep was easy to do in his arms that night. I laid my head on\ntop of his chest listening to the drum of his beating heart. I had never felt\nlike I was more at home than ever before in my life. He pulled me gently\nin closer to him, letting me know that he was there for me even when the\nlights went out and the thoughts would usually creep in. Amazing how he\nknew what I needed without even asking for it. Wishing for something\nlike this my whole life I thought 1 was being such a fool in so many ways,\nbut I was so wrong. The way his pretty eyes looked at me with such an\nunderstanding and compassionate sincerity made me want to trust his\nwords and believe the love that he was offering me was indeed real.\nThe next morning, Robbie was up and out of bed early to pick up our\ntailored wedding suits and dresses for our big day at Doi Cept Temple.\nHis best friend from high school days that was travelling with him from\nAustralia met him in the hotel lobby at seven o' clock. He was going to be\njoining us for the wedding as Robbie' s best man. He still hadn' t been able\nto find black shoes to go with the suit, so after he dropped off my dress\nback to me he was off again to try and find himself a pair of decent\nlooking ones. Overjoyed with excitement I was thrilled from the second I\nkissed Robbie good-bye for the last time before we were officially\nmarried. Looking in the same mirror only a week ago I was now a\ndifferent person, I felt like I was plunging into a bottomless abyss. Here I\ngo, I thought to myself as I plunged out the door letting the butterflies in\nmy stomach carry me all the way to my nearly husband.\nI had to go to the beauticians that morning for my pre- wedding makeup\nand dressing. The ladies who were doing my hair and face at the salon did\na great job making me feel so beautiful for my special occasion that every\ngirl dreams about their whole entire life. Requesting simplicity at best,\nnot wanting to go overboard with all of the wedding apparel they tied my\nlong hair up into a knot wrapping around it a veil of flowers made up of\nbaby' s breath and small yellow and purple budding flowers. I couldn' t\nhave dreamt it up better myself and when I met my husband to be at the\nbottom of the mountain he stood before me speechless \" You look so...\nbeautiful!\" were his first words that his mouth formed almost whispering\nthem. He took my hand and we walked into the sky lift together. Behind\nus followed an interpreter that Robbie hired to translate the Buddhist\nMonks ceremony speech for us English only speakers and then his best\nfriend, who only moments before gave him the best mans speech about\nbeing the last chance to walk away from this and not get married to a girl\nhe hardly knew, but my Robbie wouldn' t hear a word of it. He already\nmade up his mind the instant he proposed and I said yes, \" I was born to\nbe with this girl,\" he told his best mate. \" Alright then lets go do this\nthen!\" Once he knew Robbie was sure in his decision lie was more than\necstatic for him. We were slowly lifted up the tremendous mountainside,\n127\n128\n1 Copvnpht Protected Material\nCONFIDLN' I' IAL\n0 Copyright Protected Material\nGIUFFRE004260 CONFIDGN' 111AL GIUlTRL004261\nsurrounded by the floral green carpet of mossy grass that covered the\nearthly skyscraper and falling fog, it was like being carried to heaven or\nthe closest thing to it! Taking my eyes off the scenery and catching him\nadoringly staring at me again, I welled up with unstoppable tears. \" I am\nso lucky, is this really happening?' He squeezed my hands and replied\nback \" You' re the only one for me ... I love you!\" relieving the anxiety\nwritten all over my tear stained face.\nChapter 22\nGetting out of the carriage we were greeted by good fortune from the\nGods above. A sun shower cascaded over us at we advanced into the\nancient holy temple. My tears ofjoy dried and my happiness was glowing\nfor all to see. The many visitors to the temple stopped and took photos of\nthe passing bride and groom, no other foreigners had ever been married\nthere and certainly anyone wearing traditional western wedding attire,\nsuch a sight had never been seen behind these religious walls, we became\na permanent icon at the temple. The ceremony was done in the Buddhist\ncustoms according to their ancestral accordance, and translated for us in\nour own language. Both Robbie and I were anointed with a blessing from\nthe monk with a splash of water and seven sacramental bracelets, each\none representing another meaning to the longevity of our union together.\nWe signed our names in the Buddhist wedding registry of Doi Cept\nTemple and officially became Mr. & Mrs. Roberts at least officially in\nour hearts knowing the laws of Australia only recognize certified\nweddings, meaning when we got back to his homeland we' d have to\nmake a rum for the courthouse. This was our real wedding though, perfect\ndown to every detail. Walking up to the highest point of the temple to the\nbalcony hanging over the edge of a cliff side over looking the city of\nChang -Mai, we knew we had found the perfect spot to recite our vows of\nlove to each other. Providing everything for me and more than I could\never ask for, his vows were to love me unconditionally until death do we\npart, shelter me from all the cruelty in the world that I was so accustomed\ntoo and to be like the bear, because the bear never forgets. Tears once\nagain streamed down from my eyes as he made this moment\nunforgettable. Wiping the mascara fading underneath my eyelids whilst\ngiggling at my embarrassment I took his hands back into mine again and\ngave him the vows that were the sacred prepared words from my heart.\nMy ears were thundering the sound of a million horses hoofs descending\ndownhill and my heart was beating so fast my words barely trembled out\nof my mouth when I began to tell him how much he had changed my\nwhole life around and how I would dedicate my entire being to loving\nhim and only him until I blew my final breath.\nI meant every word that I said to him, this was it for me, wanting\nnothing more out of life than to be with someone like him to raise a few\nkids together and grow old on the front porch letting the days fade its by.\nI know it probably sounds boring to most and it would' ve to me as well\nmany years ago but after the life I had led, I had enough experience in the\nreal world for my liking and now all I want to do is to enjoy the\nremaining days of my life for what it is... a simple and satisfying\nexistence. Our day was so special but not only to us, even too the Monk\nthat married us. Upon our descent down the lifts he asked if he could take\na photo with the bride and groom in front of their symbolic liberty bell\nsignifying the union between east and west_ It represented a lot for its too,\nit was the commencement of a new life together and just the beginning of\nbattling each other' s past demons together.\nKissing the bridal party goodbye, who were just the local girls 1 had\nmet on some of our many nights out of having fun. 1 threw my arranged\nbouquet of Thailand' s white wedding floras mixed with colorful orchids\nto the screaming Thai women behind me and we were given one last\ntradition to take with us, the release of caged doves. It was such an\nincredible gesture, especially for me. Symbolizing their freedom as well\nas mine I opened the cage' s door to let them free to decide our own fates.\nAs the wings on the birds began to spread open and they took their final\ndecent into the blue skies granting themselves freedom I knew mine had\nfinally come too. The relevance of watching them fly away and how 1 had\nperceived my own day of marriage related to the identical feeling of\nfleeing an entrapment of my own kind. I was liberated from the bounds of\nslavery I had come to know over the many years 1 had spent with my fair\nshare of greedy perverted old men only to have serendipity mend my\nscars with the powerful healing of what true love has to endeavor on.\nAs customary in the romance novels I had read as a young girl lie\npicked me up in the hallway before our hotel suite and carried me over\nthe threshold, poufy dress and all. My arms were tightly squeezed around\nhis neck never once taking my eyes off of him until he revealed yet\nanother sweet surprise. Besides the cleaners tiding up my room while we\nwere gone they were also given instructions by none other than the groom\nhimself to pick the petals off the stems of red roses to place on our bed in\nthe shape of a giant heart. The rose petals led the way to where we\nconsummated our love physically and it was undeniably the first time in\nmy life I had really ever been made love too. Hours had passed by before\nwe thought about anything else besides one another' s words of arousal,\ntantalizing touches, and lingering kisses. We ate a quiet dinner at a local\nrestaurant and went straight back to the arms of each other again, so\n129\n130\nd Copyright I' rotcctcd M-- 1 U Copyright protected Material\nCONFIDENT IAL GIUFFRE004262 CONFIDENTIAL GIUI FRL004263\nprofoundly in love with one another it was the ideal display of what the\nhoneymoon period\" should have to show for. It was crazy, young and\nenergetic, just what it should be between two blossoming lovers.\nThe following morning we left the Princess Hotel, no longer under any\nof Jeffrey' s financial privileges or control so to speak, continuing our\nlove spree in another dwelling of our own accord. Three days later when\nwe finally showed our face for the first time since checking in downstairs\nin the new hotel lobby, besides to request fresh sheets and towels, the\nentire staff of the hotel had a good laugh at our expenditure, from their\nreaction it must' ve been nice to see a couple so affectionately fond of\neach other.\nNow we wanted to have another type of frm, Robbie had visited a\ntourist agent by himself before we got hitched to book a honeymoon\nitinerary for its to explore Thailand and beyond together, another surprise\nhe had in store for me. We left early in the morning and joined the\ncrowded bus for ourjourney beyond the border of Thailand to a village in\nthe war torn nation of Laos. When we got through the extremely armored\nvisa office eight hours off the beaten path, we then had to cross a flooding\nriver from a recent heavy downpour of rain in a slim banana boat that\nlooked like it could barely handle our weight let alone the excess of my\nluggage that Robbie was so kind to trek around the world for me.\nUnbelievably we did make it to the other side only to find that my\nhoneymoon in the tropics wasn' t exactly how it had been explained to\nme. Naked children ran through the dirty streets, with one boy that\ndecided to release his bladder on the pathway where we were walking as\nwe passed by him on the way to our hotel. My doubts of his choice in\ndestinations became apparent after that sight. Robbie was getting hungry\nafter we hadn' t eaten the entire duration of the trip and being such a\nrugged man he could digest just about anything. Deciding to stop on the\nside of the road he ordered some kind of seafood dish... daring I thought,\nsettling for some toast and jam, something safer I thought. Then I saw the\nlady behind the counter dip some plates in a dirty bucket full of dirty\nwater and then rinse in another bucket of water that didn' t look as bad as\nthe previous mud drenched one and then further proceeded to put my\ntoast and his food on top of them serving it to us all in a clear view. I just\ncouldn' t bring myself to even fathom it \"I can' t eat that!\" I mouthed in a\nhushed voice trying to quietly make my point clear but was made public\nwith his loud mouth outburst of \"Why not? Looks fine to me. You have\nto try and eat something, you haven' t eaten all day!\" I know it was just\nhis caring side that was trying to force me and to top it off he is Sicilian\nand they' re all about eating so it was our first debate and now we were\nofficially married with many more marital conflicts to subsequently\nfollow. Two head strong and stubborn people both with the right\nintentions but still recovering from old wounds. It was only natural and\nimportant that we fought just as much as we made passionate love\ntogether. Countlessly proving to one another the true intentions of each\nother loves but sometimes in not so seemingly actions.\nFinally arriving at the hotel it was like a scene out of a horror flick. We\nwere showed up to the room that looked like someone had been brutally\nkilled in. The bed sheets were torn apart and the bed was stained with\nblood from some poor helpless victim. Nearly vomiting at the pure sight\nof the room and the stench that accompanied it, I was now tearing at the\nthought of even staying here for a single moment longer. \" No way!\" I\ntold my new husband and from the tone in my voice he knew 1 was\nserious. Not that I was not denying the fact I have never been an outback\ntype of girl. I was fine with that impression, I am no snob but give me the\nsimple luxuries of a clean bed and a shower then I' ll make myself at\nhome, but this was just the epitome of filth and even possibly an act of a\nhorrendous event but who knows, the lady who showed us to the room\nseemed fine with it passing it off as a hooker on her period. In some ways\nthat was even worse...\" Yuk... Okay Robbie it' s time to go ... now!\" we\nwere heading back down hill back to the passport center declaring our\npassage back into Thailand. Considering us a risk due to the short time\nwe spent crossing the border and back, the officials held us at gunpoint\nwhile others rummaged through our luggage for drugs or whatnot.\nFinding nothing of course they released us and stamped our passports,\nmaking us good for another three months if we wanted. We were thankful\nfor escaping with our lives alone, although we had nothing to hide but\nstill an endearing experience nonetheless in the first days of our\nhoneymoon of all days.\nChapter 23\nArriving in Koh Samui for finally a bit of relaxation in the tropics, it\nwell,\nwas my idea of how a holiday should be, sunny warm, and clean...\nclean enough. We lived it up like kings for the next six weeks. Making it\nan ideal way for two strangers to properly get acquainted. Dancing into\nthe wee hours of the night and making love in the blistering heat of the\nsunny days we discovered everything on that island... mostly being each\nother. We made friends of all sorts, mostly travelers, but everyone the\nsame in being taken aback by our fairytale romance. With our captivated\neyes never straying too far from one another anyone could easily see the\nstrong chemistry between us.\nTrying to find the woman in me wasn' t difficult, as 1 took to the bounds\nof marriage with such ease, no longer a girl I loved the idea of being a\n131\n132\nIl Copyright Pr tc— d Material\nCopyright Protoctod Material\nCONFIDEN77AL GIUFFRE004264 CONFIDENTIAL OIUITRE004265\nwife and belonging to a husband like Robbie. Marriage was bliss for the\nduration of our honeymoon until we had to ride coach on our way to\nBangkok Airport to fly out to Australia. Chatting away with always so\nmuch to say to each other we watched a movie and finally got\ncomfortable leaning up against each other as pillows. We both fell asleep\non the long ride and when we woke up to the sound of the buses brakes\ncoming to a halt we initially realized my purse and Robbie' s wallet with\nall of our money and cards in it was missing. Stranded in the city of\nBangkok was frightening enough as it was but too make matters worse a\nlady looking in her mid -seventies, scrawny and hunched over from an\nobvious lack of nutrition lifted up her skirt to a passer- byer with a she -\nmale hanging off his arm and began smacking her vagina blaring out\nLook! No cock... Pussy, pussy! Only five baht\" repeating herself many\ntimes over the man just walked on past as she sat back down on the curb\nwaiting for the next alluring customer_ Robbie and 1 shook our heads in\ndisgust and disbelief, things could really be that bad for someone, I would\nknow best as it wasn' t far off the life Jeffrey had been training me up for.\nCompletely broke at two o' clock in the morning and with no one to call\nfor help, I panicked right away. Robbie rubbed my back and his tired eyes\ntrying to make the situation better. Luckily we had made friends with\nsome really nice people from the resort on the island who gave us about\ntwo thousand baht when they saw how devastated Robbie and I were.\nWith just enough money to rent a really cheap room for the night at a\nbackpackers hostel and pay for a taxi to the airport the following day, we\nwere saved.\nEarly the next morning we were off in separate planes, since Robbie' s\nticket was pre -booked and no available seats left for me to join him meant\nwe would be landing in Australia separately. Fortunately we had found a\ncorresponding flight that arrived within the same hour of each other but I\nwould have to make a stop over to the Philippines. The lengthy hours of\nthe duration on the flight seemed to stretch on with only the thoughts of\nthe journey ahead of me I couldn' t wait to get back to my husbands\nloving arms. The trip was going well, sleeping the majority of the flight\nuntil I had to change planes in the Philippines.\nAfter the plane landed and before any passenger was allowed to get off\nwe were handed a declaration statement that informed us that if we were\ncarrying any drugs or weaponry, we would be arrested and face charges\nwith death as the ultimate penalty. Not that I had anything to worry about,\nbut what a thought to willingly sign over your life. I got the chills\nhanding over my signed declaration and traveling documents to the\ncustoms officer. Obtaining my passport he additionally asked to see my\ndeparting ticket. No problem I thought, just I had done many of times,\nand I handed over the requested information. The officer looked me over\nand got on the phone immediately which sounded like a phone call to his\nsuperiors but I couldn' t tell since it was in another language. A brief\nconversation but long enough to get me thinking, he then called over two\nguards who took me by the arms and brought me into an empty room but\nfor a desk and three chairs to be interrogated. No one would tell me what\nwas going on they all just scattered around in frenzy, ignoring all of my\nhysterical inquisitions. Leaving me by myself and alone with my thoughts\nI couldn' t help but panic even worse now.\nThis was a total bombshell of confusion on my part, what had 1 done\nwrong? Minute' s later a large -framed women in a green uniform entered\nthe room with the guards from before and sat down across from me with\na stern look in her eyes. She placed my documents on the desk in between\nus. Not saying a word to me she was waiting for me to give her an\nexplanation for something. \" Can you please tell me what this is about,\nhave I done something wrong?\" I asked her politely, trying to restraint\nany animosity towards her. Her reply sounded as grim as she looked.\nYou have been in Thailand for three months and now you have only a\none way ticket booked to Australia with no visa. What exactly are your\nplans once you get there, Ms. Roberts?\" To myself I wondered what\nbusiness it was to her, don' t people travel with one- way tickets all the\ntime? Knowing I was in no position to be able to say anything like that or\neven at all I just gave in nicely and told her my intentions to travel over\nthere. Crying through my entire explanation I wasn' t sure if I was going\nto even make my flight now. She had to think about everything I had told\nher for a moment, deciding whether or not she would grant me\npermission to meet my husband in Australia or send me back alone to\nBangkok. With only time on my side she had to make a hasty verdict\nnow. One more question had to be answered before 1 was let go, she\nwanted some proof. \" If you have just got married can you show me your\nmarriage certificate then?\" This didn' t help my stories credibility at all\nseeing that we were married in a Buddhist temple and given woven\nbracelets instead of certificates. Explaining to her that I didn' t have one to\nshow her yet but was already aware that I would have to obtain a legal\nmarriage certificate through a courthouse upon my arrival in Australia to\nstay there legally, it was only because of my husbands beliefs we wanted\nto get married in a Buddhist ceremony. She must have shared a common\ninterest in religion or something like that as she finally cracked a smile\nupon the photos of the wedding day that I showed her and carrying in my\npurse since getting them developed, if she wanted proof, well this is all I\nreally had.\nHanding me back my documents and ticket I was now free to leave but\nshe wasn' t leaving me much time to run through the airports terminal to\nget to my departing plane. Expeditiously bolting through the busy airport\n133\n134\n0 Copyright I', -- d MM ­,, I 0 Copynght Protectod Maml'10I\nCONFIDEMFIAL _ GIUFFRE004266 CONFIDENTIAL GNFFRE004267\nmy adrenaline was still pumping from the previous encounter with the\nofficials of the Philippines who had enough power to condemn me if they\nhad felt like it. I caught my plane in the knick of time and once I was\nsettled in my seat my thoughts went back to my dear Robbie and how\nmuch I was missing him. I was just relieved that I was on my way to be\nback with him again soon.\nLooking out the window I could see the red earth beneath me. As I\nlanded for the last time I took notice of the first steps I walked off the\nplane and onto a new soil for the first time. I had so much to be looking\nforward too in my new homeland. In my heart I knew this was all I ever\nwanted, this was going to be my haven. There was another surprise in\nstore for me when two elder strangers walked up to me and asked my\nname. \" Are you Jenna?\" Nodding at their question they gave me their\nfirst names and wrapped their arms around my neck. My new mother -in\nlaw then said, \" We are Robbie' s parents. We wanted to be the first ones\nwho welcomed you to Australia and into our family\" It was my in- laws\nmeeting me for the first time. Handing me some balloons and flowers\nthey even had gifts for their new daughter -in law. While waiting for\nRobbie' s plane to arrive we all chatted about many things like the flight\nover from Thailand and the scare at the previous airport in the\nPhilippines. I asked them how they knew whom to look for? My father in\nlaw laughed, saying recognizing me was easy from Robbie' s detailed\ndescription. He told them to look out for a petite, young blonde carrying\nan abundance of luggage. Laughing together over a few more brief\nconversations of getting to know each other better they seemed relieved\nto finally meet me compared how stressed she sounded in the\nconversations I overheard Robbie having with her while in Thailand.\nWatching the arrivals board I knew Robbie' s plane had landed ages ago\nbut was just waiting for him to get out of customs. It didn' t bother me\nanyhow, 1 was enjoying get accompanied with his parents for the first\ntime. Eventually I saw my husband walking down the runway behind the\ngates, I just couldn' t wait a second longer. I ducked underneath the gates\nand ran all the way up the runway to jump excitedly into his arms. I\nwrapped my arms and legs around him holding onto him for dear life. I\njust missed him so much I knew I would never let him go, theoretically\nspeaking that is, and I never have nearly a decade later.\nChapter 24\nOver the near decade we spent together, Robbie and I have shared the\ncommon highs and lows that every determined marriage endures. It has\ntaken a lot of hard work and doesn' t come without its flaws but no matter\nwhat it is just perfect for the two of us. He helped Ine how to remember to\nsmile again and life has slowly began to sort itself out. They say that time\nheals all wounds but what I had experienced in my young years wasn' t\nnearly long enough to let all of the hurt go. Seeking help through many\ncounselors and psychiatrists I was doing everything I could do to deal\nwith the scars and all of the pain left behind. Completely off of any\npharmaceuticals, since the last day of our honeymoon, and healing my\nheart with love instead of hate our marriage is my foundation and Robbie\nis my solid rock. We have to be for one another, putting the bonds of our\nunion through the wringers and back, as neither of us expected my past\nlife eventually to come back and haunt me after so long.\nOur blissful life came to a sudden halt one day when we were out\nvisiting my in- laws at their nearby house on just another plain afternoon.\nThere was a knock on the front door and my father in law got up from\nwatching TV on the couch to answer it. He rushed back quickly coming\ninto the dining room, where I was feeding my nineteen months and five\nmonth old boys at the table, and he blurted out, \" Jenna there are three\npolice officer' s at the door asking for you by the name of Virginia\nRoberts!\" I asked my mother in law to stay with the babies to find out\nwhat this was all about. I didn' t even think it had anything to do with\nJeffrey at first and wasn' t even worried when I opened the door to offer\nthem to come inside to talk.\nThey weren' t actually police officers and two federal agents of\nAustralia with one F. B. I agent from America. The American agent asked\nif I wouldn' t mind actually coming outside so that I may speak with them\nin private. \" Okay\" I said, as well as mentally preparing myself for\nsomething big from the look of it, it' s not over a parking ticket or\nanything small that you get three federal agents knocking at your in- laws\nfront door asking to speak in private. \" Can we first ask you if you are in\nfact Ms. Virginia Roberts and originally from Palm Beach County in the\nUnited States?\" I confirmed my name and previous state of residence\nthen they even asked, \" May we see some identification please?\" A\ndifferent agent asked the question this time and I told him \" I will have to\ngo and grab it, my purse is inside. I' ll just be one second.\"\nRobbie was standing on the other side of the door trying to figure out\nwhat they were doing here talking to me and when I rushed through it to\ngrab my purse and saw him standing there looking puzzled, I told him I\nhad no idea what this was about yet, but not too worry everything was\ngoing too be just fine. Taking a deep breath and slowly exhaling\noutwards, I opened the door to find out exactly what the agents wanted to\ntalk about.\n135\n136\nCopyright Pi ­, ted Materiel Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL C11, JFPRE004268 CONFIDENTIAL 01111FRE004269\nPulling out my Australian drivers license from my wallet, I was going\nto hand it over to them but they were sufficed at a quick glance. There\nwas no meet and greet, they went straight to the point. One agent picked\nup a briefcase off the porch floor and opened it up taking out a stapled\nstack of paper. Then that same agent asked me if I had ever known an\naffiliate by the name of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. All of the sudden my\nstomach tangled in a familiar knot that I hadn' t felt in many years from a\npast life that I was trying to forget about. I nodded in affirmation of their\nquestion and said \" It was a long time ago and he' s no longer an affiliate\nof mine, but yes, I did know him once.\" It was shameful enough to think\nabout let alone talk about with them for the first time since I had started\nmy entire life over. His next response left me nothing short of speechless.\nThe United States Attorney' s Office for the district of Florida was giving\nme a notification of being an identified victim. Jeffrey was finally caught\nfor his atrocious acts ofperversion on girls who were barely old enough\nto even comprehend \" the birds and the bees\" so to speak.\nOn June 30°i 2008, Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty for procurement of\nminors to engage in and solicitation of prostitution. More than a dozen\ngirls had been named as victims of Jeffrey' s federal offense' s and without\never stepping a day in court he was granted a plea bargain consenting to\ncharges that named him a registered pedophile for only two of the minor\ngirls. Getting away with even serving only twelve of the sentenced\neighteen months behind bars be that in the evening alone and in the\nmorning he was released during the day. Restricted to the confinement of\nhis lavish mansion in Palm Beach only to be with his original sex slaves\nfrom over ten years ago, Nadia Marcinkova and Sarah Kellen, and\nknowing Jeffrey all too well, they wouldn' t be the only ones there while\nhe was pulling his laughing stint of retribution. Even at nighttime the girls\nwere still allowed to visit him, accounting to nearly seventy times while\nserving his time in incarceration.\nNo justice had been served for any of us victims. Denied the very\nconstitutional rights allegedly there to protect and serve us. We weren' t\nallowed to have a voice in front of a jury and judge or even informed for\nthat matter. Instead we were handed this notification of being a victim but\ntold we were all too late to do anything about. To make matters worse\npart of that plea bargain was that we had the option to sue him with the\nlawyers he provided for us, and conveniently enough I found out later\nthey were also his lawyer' s old friends from the college days.\nI felt my knees go weak and the anxiety churning in my stomach was\nnow making me feel sick. Taking the bundle of paperwork from the agent\nwho was now handing it to over me, I had to excuse myself before my\nlegs actually buckled. Closing the door behind me I couldn' t even find\nthe words to tell my husband what was going on. I rushed to the back of\nthe house and went out to the back yard where 1 wanted a minute to\ncompose myself and process the information I had just been told. Robbie\nfollowed behind me but the stillness in my eyes convinced him to give\nme that moment to compile my emotions.\nA few moments later and I was ready to talk. Collapsing into his arms\nwith such anguish, he just held me until my sobs subsided and I was able\nto tell him what actually happened. Starting with an apology, I began to\ntell him how I was so sorry but my troubled past has come back to plague\nour simply sweet lives and was just about to turn it all upside down. He\nwas so understanding from the beginning of all this, telling me that he\nwill always be behind every choice that 1 make in mending the sorrows of\nmy tormenting past and there he has been through all of the thick and\nthins.\nDeciding to call the lawyers on the victim suit provided for me was a\nbig decision but one I had to do to seek the unanswered questions from\nmy battered heart. The two women at the firm that I spoke to treated me\nso wonderfully, like long term friends they counseled me not only in the\nterms of a lawsuit towards Jeffrey but also in the matters of being\nemotionally and sexually abused. I chose to proceed with the lawsuit at\nleast to make a statement to a man that tried to make a degrading\nstatement about me so long ago. Now it was my turn, I had the choice to\nturn the tables on him hoping he would feel embarrassed and in the\nspotlight for everyone' s entertainment where lie had kept me for so many\nyears.\nWinning my lawsuit against him was not enough to heal old wounds, I\nnever got the chance to stand up in front of a jury and tell them how\nmuch pain I had endured and still endure throughout the many nightmares\nI face when darkness hits and the silence of the sleeping household fills\nmy head with pictures of reliving my past with him or the others he sent\nme too. Or did I even get to hear him confess his guilt and suffer the way\nI did locked in confinement for many years? No, instead I got to see a.\npicture of Jeffrey with his anus around a very youthful looking teenager,\nif even that, parading the streets of New York, the very way he had with\nme and so many other girls long before.\nAs if it were a public display intended for not only his many victims to\nsee but also a spectacle for the public justice system, it was bold show of\ninsolence laughing in our faces while we all sat by not being able to do\nanything to help these young girls from the streets still suffering his\nperverted afflictions. Not much longer there was another story on Jeffrey\nI saw in the papers of him and Prince Andrew having a stroll together in\nCentral Park. It instantly sparked my concerns for other girls in the very\nsame position I was in so long ago and he was obviously up to the same\nold tricks, I had to do something now. Not being able to sit by any longer\n137\n138\n17 Copyright Protected Material - 0 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDEN' 17AL GIUFFRE004270 CONFIDENTIAL GIUF1RE004271\nwith the knowledge of being able to help out in some way. I had to tell\nmy story no matter how shameful it was to even speak about. Putting my\nshame aside I had to derive every bit of courage I could sustain and now I\nam ready to tell it. The hardest lesson T had failed at learning until later\non in my life became my strength, the belief in my inner voice and the\nability to speak up. I do have a voice and now the world is going to hear\nit in my whispered cries for justice. Swept away by a surge of media with\none phone call I sent Jeffrey' s publicist into frenzy. Not to mention the\nrelease of the photos showing the first night that Prince Andrew and I\nshared together that I so happened to unveil for the public to see.\nI spent too much of my life going out of my mind waiting for the\nrescue that never came until it was too late and then the scars were\nalready imbedded deeply within. Thankfully I am now free from the\nstruggles that nearly destroyed the love inside of my heart. I only wish it\ncould be the same for the other victims, not just of Jeffrey' s inflictions\nbut every person who has ever suffered at the hands of another.\nI' m here to tell you from my own experience that the moon is yours if\nthat' s what you want, all you have to do is stand up and take it. If some\ngirl off the streets of Florida, like me, can stand up against the tyrants that\nnm the deep pockets of our world, than anyone can. Just like I needed to\nbelieve that someone stood up for me once like Robbie did long ago, I\nnow stand up for us. For all of us girls, the ones who are still on the\nstreets and think they don' t deserve better or it' s an unachievable dream\nto be entitled to more out of life. For all of the beautiful girls who don' t\nsee beyond they' re outside appearance. For all the girls still trapped in\nenslavement and unable to get out of the abuse that holds them down. But\nmost of all, I stand up for every girls belief in love, because it is the very\nsavior of my spirit and soul.\nThe End\nWritten and Illustrated by Virginia Roberts\n139\n140\nMaterial\nCI Cap— Sht Protected Material _\nCopyright Protected\nGIUFFRL004273\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFF8004272 CONFIDL'NTIAL\n\n141\nCopyright Proroctcd M—\nCONFIDLN7'IAL\nml\nGIUFFRF004274\n"
