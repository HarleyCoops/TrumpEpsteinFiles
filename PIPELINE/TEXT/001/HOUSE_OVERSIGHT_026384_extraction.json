TRUMP and\nJEFFREY E. EPSTEIN,\nDefendants.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nCase No.:\nJURY TRIAL DEMANDED\nCOMPLAINT FOR RAPE, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, CRIMINAL SEXUAL ACTS,\nSEXUAL ABUSE, FORCIBLE TOUCHING, ASSAULT, BATTERY, INTENTIONAL\nAND RECKLESS INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, DURESS, FALSE\nIMPRISONMENT, AND DEFAMATION\n______________________________________________________________________________\nPlaintiff Jane Doe, proceeding under a pseudonym, brings this action against Donald J.\nTrump and Jeffrey E. Epstein, and alleges that:\nPARTIES\n1. Plaintiff is an individual residing in and a citizen of the State of California.\n2. Upon information and belief, Defendants Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein\neach reside in this District and are citizens of the State of New York.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n3. Plaintiff is a citizen of the State of California for purposes of diversity jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1332.\n4. Defendants are citizens of the State of New York for purposes of diversity\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.\nCase 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 2 of 9\n5. This Court has original subject matter jurisdiction with respect to this action\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 as there exists complete diversity of citizenship between Plaintiff\nand Defendants and the amount in controversy exceeds Seventy Five Thousand Dollars\n($75,000.00), exclusive of interest and costs.\n6. Defendants are each subject to the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1332 with proper venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 as both defendants are residents of\nand/or are domiciled in this district and the events giving rise to the claims occurred in this\ndistrict.\nRAPE, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, CRIMINAL SEXUAL ACTS, SEXUAL ABUSE,\nFORCIBLE TOUCHING, ASSAULT, BATTERY, INTENTIONAL AND RECKLESS\nINFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, DURESS, AND FALSE\nIMPRISONMENT\n7. Plaintiff was subject to acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts,\nsexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional and reckless infliction of emotional\ndistress, duress, false imprisonment, and threats of death and/or serious bodily injury by the\nDefendants that took place at several parties during the summer months of 1994. The parties\nwere held by Defendant Epstein at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant\nEpstein at 9 E. 71st St. in Manhattan. During this period, Plaintiff was a minor of age 13 and\nwas legally incapable under New York law of consenting to sexual intercourse and the other\nsexual contacts detailed herein. NY Penal L § 130.05(3)(a). The rapes in the first, second, and\nthird degrees; sexual misconduct; criminal sexual acts in the first, second, and third degrees;\nsexual abuse in the first, second, and third degrees; and forcible touching (and, on information\n2\nCase 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 3 of 9\nand belief, predatory sexual assault) detailed herein are unlawful under New York law, e.g., NY\nPenal L § 130.20-130.52, and 130.55-130.65 (and, on information and belief, 130.95) and\nconstitute the torts of, inter alia, assault, battery, false imprisonment, and intentional or reckless\ninfliction of emotional distress, including threats of force and serious bodily harm, under New\nYork law. Declaration of Plaintiff Jane Doe, Exhibit A hereto; Declaration of Tiffany Doe,\nExhibit B hereto. Jane Doe and Tiffany Doe are each pseudonyms as each woman wishes\nanonymity. Tiffany Doe, a witness, was an employee of Defendant Epstein. Exh. B.\n8. Courts have discretion to allow proceeding anonymously where the need for\nprivacy outweighs the public’s interest in knowing their identity and any prejudice to the\ndefendants. Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 189 (2d Cir. 2008). This\nlitigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and identification of\nPlaintiff would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to her and to others. Exh. A. All of the\nten factors that the Second Circuit articulated as relevant to this analysis favor anonymity,\nespecially factors 1-4, 7, and 10 (e.g., factors one and two: “whether the litigation involves\nmatters that are ‘highly sensitive and [of a] personal nature,’” and “’whether identification poses\na risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to the ... party [seeking to proceed anonymously] or\neven more critically, to innocent non-parties’”.), or are neutral with respect to anonymity.\nProtecting Plaintiff’s anonymity is also appropriate as she is a rape victim.\n9. Plaintiff was enticed by promises of money and a modeling career to attend a\nseries of parties, with other similarly situated minor females, held at a New York City residence\nthat was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. At least four of the parties were attended by\nDefendant Trump. Exhs. A and B. On information and belief, by this time in 1994, Defendant\n3\nCase 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 4 of 9\nTrump had known Defendant Epstein for seven years (New York, 10/28/02), and knew that\nPlaintiff was then just 13 years old. Exhs. A and B.\n10. Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties.\nOn the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff\nto a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the\ncourse of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but\nwith no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in\nthe face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. Exhs. A and\nB.\n11. Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened Plaintiff that, were\nshe ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse of her by Defendant Trump,\nPlaintiff and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. Exhs. A and B.\n12. Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with Plaintiff at two of the parties. The\nsecond sexual encounter with Defendant Epstein took place after Plaintiff had been raped by\nDefendant Trump. Defendant Epstein forced himself upon Plaintiff and proceeded to rape her\nanally and vaginally despite her loud pleas to stop. Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike\nPlaintiff about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff that he,\nDefendant Epstein, rather than Defendant Trump, should have been the one who took Plaintiff’s\nvirginity, before Plaintiff finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein. Exhs. A and\nB.\n13. The threats of violence against Plaintiff and her family continued, this time from\nDefendant Epstein, who again reiterated that Plaintiff was not to reveal any of the details of his\n4\nCase 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 5 of 9\nsexual and physical abuse of her or else, specifically, Plaintiff and her family would be seriously\nphysically harmed, if not killed. Exhs. A and B.\n14. While still under threats of physical harm by coming forward and having no\nreason to believe that the threats have ever been lifted or would ever be lifted, Plaintiff, who has\nsuffered from stress, emotional distress, mental pain and suffering, among other problems, ever\nsince the assaults, was subjected to daily painful reminders of the horrific acts of one of the\nperpetrators, Defendant Trump, via mass media coverage of him starting on or about June 16,\n2015 that, over a short period of time, became continuous and unavoidable. Exh. A.\n15. As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by\nDefendants upon her, Plaintiff has suffered stress, emotional distress, and mental pain and\nsuffering, as well as adverse physical consequences.\n16. As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by\nDefendants upon her, Plaintiff has suffered physical pain and suffering.\n17. As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by\nDefendants upon her, Plaintiff has been subjected to public scorn, hatred, and ridicule and has\nsuffered threats against her life and physical safety.\n18. As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by\nDefendants upon her, Plaintiff has incurred special damages, including medical and legal\nexpenses.\n19. The sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by Defendants upon Plaintiff were\nintentional acts.\n20. The conduct of Defendants demonstrates willful, reckless and intentional conduct\nthat raises a conscious indifference to consequences.\n5\nCase 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 6 of 9\n21. At the appropriate time in this litigation, Plaintiff shall amend her complaint to\nassert a claim for punitive damages against Defendants in order to punish Defendants for their\nactions and to deter Defendants from repeating their conduct.\nTOLLING OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n22. Any statute of limitations applicable to rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual\nacts, sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional and reckless infliction of\nemotional distress, false imprisonment of a minor, if any, is tolled owing to the continuous and\nactive duress imposed upon Plaintiff by Defendants that effectively robbed Plaintiff of her free\nwill to commence legal action until the present time. Cullen v. Margiotta, 811 F.2d 698, 722\n(2nd Cir.1987); Ross v. United States, 574 F. Supp. 536, 542 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). More\nparticularly, Plaintiff was unrelentingly threatened by each Defendant that, were she ever to\nreveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to her by Defendants, Plaintiff\nand her family would be physically harmed if not killed. The duress has not terminated and the\nfear has not subsided. The duress is an element of or inherent in the underlying causes of action\ncomplained of herein. The duress and coercion exerted by Defendants has been such as to have\nactually deprived Plaintiff of her freedom of will to institute suit earlier in time, and it rose to\nsuch a level that a person of reasonable firmness in Plaintiff's situation would have been unable\nto resist. Exhs. A and B.\n23. Both Defendants let Plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man\nand indicated that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed,\nDefendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn’t ever say anything if she didn’t want to disappear\nlike Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with\n6\nCase 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 7 of 9\nDefendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident, and that he was\ncapable of having her whole family killed. Exhs. A and B.\n24. The duress had prevented Plaintiff from starting litigation before this year.\nHowever, as soon as she surfaced, she received threats. More specifically, shortly after her first\ncomplaint was filed in California on April 26, 2016, she started receiving threatening phone calls\non her cell phone. Exh. A.\n25. Defendants are equitably estopped from arguing that any statute of limitations has\nnot been tolled as Defendants wrongfully forced Plaintiff to refrain from timely commencing this\naction by threats, duress, and other misconduct. Exhs. A and B.\n26. Moreover, this action has been brought before the facts giving rise to the estoppel\nhave ceased to be operational (i.e., while still under threats of physical harm by coming forward\nand having no reason to believe that the threats have ever been lifted or would ever be lifted) and\nsince Plaintiff has decided to seek redress at this time, Plaintiff seeks an order of protection in\nfavor of Plaintiff and all associated with her so as to protect them from harm and harassment\nfrom Defendants and their agents and associates. Exh. A.\nDEFAMATION\n27. On information and belief, on or about April 28, 2016, Defendant Trump\nprovided the following statement to American Media, Inc. and/or Radar Online LLC for\npublication on at least their website RadarOnline.com regarding Plaintiff’s complaint ED CV 16-\n797-DMG (KSx) filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California:\n“The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level and clearly\n7\nCase 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 8 of 9\nframed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is\nabsolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.” The statement provided for publication by\nDefendant Trump was published by said website and has been republished elsewhere in whole or\nin part numerous times (and similar statements of an attorney for Defendant Trump were also\npublished). The statement provided for publication by Defendant Trump and that was published\nby said websites is false as it pertains to Plaintiff.\n28. The published statement is libelous on its face, and clearly exposes Plaintiff to\nhatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy.\n29. As a proximate result of the above-described publication, Plaintiff has suffered\nloss of her reputation, shame, mortification, and injury to her feelings, all to her damage in an\namount to be established by proof at trial.\n30. The above-described publication was not privileged because it was published by\nDefendant Trump with malice, hatred and ill will toward Plaintiff and the desire to injure her.\n31. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant Trump’s defamation of Plaintiff,\nPlaintiff has been subjected to public scorn, hatred, and ridicule and has suffered other injury.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendants and for the\nfollowing relief:\nA. That judgment be entered against Defendants for special damages, compensatory\ndamages, and punitive damages in an amount which shall be shown to be reasonable and just by\nthe evidence and in excess of Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), exclusive of interests\nand costs;\n8\nCase 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 9 of 9\nB. That all costs of this action be assessed against Defendants, including all\nreasonable attorney’s fees, costs and expenses of this action;\nC. That an order of protection in favor of Plaintiff and all associated with her be\nissued so as to protect them from harm and harassment from Defendants and their agents and\nassociates; and\nD. Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.\nJURY DEMAND\nPlaintiff demands a trial by jury of all issues properly triable by jury in this action.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDated: June 20, 2016\nBy: /s/ Thomas Francis Meagher\nThomas Francis Meagher\nSDNY Bar Code TM6707\nOne Palmer Square\nPrinceton, New Jersey 08542\nTelephone: (609) 558-1500\ntmeagher@thomasfmeagheresq.com\nATTORNEY FOR PLAINTIFF\n9\n"
