A significant portion of the visitor\nrevenue generated in the city is attributed to the gaming industry,\nwhich posted $9.6 billion in revenue in 2014.\nThe initial step in analyzing supply and demand trends within a given\ngaming market is to quantify the existing level of gaming inventory.\nTo quantify gaming supply levels, a review of all competitive gaming\nfacilities is performed. Once the market’s supply level is known, an\nanalysis of the demand for gaming facilities is performed.\nUnlike traditional economic models of supply and demand, the price variable associated with gaming is largely determined by the consumer.\nGaming is an intangible product: the consumer is purchasing the “experience” and “excitement” casino gaming offers. The price that the\nconsumer is willing to pay for this experience is known as the “win,” and is quantified on a per-unit basis known as the “win per unit per\nday” (WPUPD). Research indicates that the WPUPD, or the price a market can bear for gaming activity, is highly correlated to the level\nof available gaming inventory. The actual WPUPD attained by a market, say $100 per gaming position, and provides an indication of the\nmarketwide demand for gaming. As will be further discussed, these demand levels within a market can be estimated through an analysis of\nthe actual WPUPD attained by the market. Historical fluctuations in the marketwide WPUPD at various levels of supply can provide insight\ninto the future demand for gaming. Further impacting the demand for gaming facilities in the market are current and projected trends in\neconomic and demographic factors such as population base, employment, disposable income levels, and visitation statistics. In addition,\nseasonal fluctuations must be taken into consideration when analyzing demand trends.\nOnce the various demand trends have been identified, a variety of analytical methodologies may be employed to forecast gaming revenue\nfor an overall market or an individual property.\n43\nGaming Supply Analysis\nThe following table presents an overview of the competitive themed Casino Resort properties as of year-end 2014 operating within the Las\nVegas Strip submarket.

ANNUAL % CHANGE 3.2 (0.6) 3.8\nSource: Las Vegas Gaming Control Board\n45\nGaming Demand Analysis\nDemand for gaming can be classified into four primary sources: the leisure segment, local residents, tour and travel groups and convention\ndemand.\nLEISURE DEMAND\nLeisure visitation to Las Vegas is enormous with visitors taking advantage of the year-round favorable climate and multitude of attractions.\nThe leisure segment utilizes both table games and gaming devices and has a higher propensity to play table games than other segments.\nAccording to the Las Vegas Convention Authority Visitors Profile Study, in 2014 approximately 47% of all visitors mentioned vacation or\npleasure, up significantly from 41% in 2013. Of those polled, 71% of all visitors said they gambled while in Las Vegas with an average\ngambling budget of $530.\nLOCAL DEMAND\nLocal demand plays a part in gaming revenue contribution to the Las Vegas market. However, the local segment’s impact on the Las Vegas\nStrip is moderate. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, 13% of locals gamble on the Strip with 45% gambling at\nleast once per week and 75% gambling at least once per month.\nTOUR AND TRAVEL DEMAND\nLas Vegas welcomed a record 41.1 million visitors in 2014, an all time record. Las Vegas tourism generates more than $45 billion in economic\nimpact for the local economy and supports 376,000 local jobs. Las Vegas is recognized worldwide as a premier gaming destination. From\ntraditional card and dice games, to slot machines and race and sports book betting, the casino industry has flourished and evolved into\nan international phenomenon. A significant portion of the visitor revenue generated in the city is attributed to the gaming industry, which\nposted $9.6 billion in revenue in 2014.\nCONVENTION DEMAND\nConvention demand within the Las Vegas market is significant. Las Vegas was the most popular trade destination (with a 25% market\nshare of the Trade Show Week 200 Shows in terms of net square footage) and third most popular convention destination in the nation. In\n1990, approximately 1.7 million persons attended trade shows and conventions in Las Vegas; In 2014, convention attendance was up to 5.2\nmillion, an increase of 8% annually over the last 25 years. Future convention expansion in demand is anticipated to see these rates of growth\ncontinue for the foreseeable future.\n46\nMultifamily Housing and Condominium Overview\nWith an increase in demand for luxury living accommodations in Las Vegas and a 100% sell out of the existing supply of recently delivered\nresidential units, condominium prices have increased dramatically. The depth of demand far exceeds the amount of new supply forecasted\nover the next five years. In addition, the economies of scale associated with new residential, retail, hotel and office development on the Las\nVegas Strip will only elevate the overall appeal of Strip living - and in turn push condominium values higher.\nTHE RESIDENCES AT MANDARIN ORIENTAL\n3740 S.

These factors\ntogether with controlled levels of new development will cause significant long-term rent increases across the submarket.\nIncreasing Levels of Visitor Spending – More than half of the 41 million visitors to Las Vegas each year spend time shopping along the Las\nVegas Strip. Average per capita visitor spending on shopping, dining and entertainment during 2014 was $815.
