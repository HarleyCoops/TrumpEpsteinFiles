Sunday/ Monday sanction rhetoric from ranging from g8 expulsion to Iran-style bank embargo is \nraised a notch. Russia follows with more threats of counter-sanctions. My sense is the Obama 5m of 696m SPR release is to show \nMerkel and co he will step in. He needs to because there are 8 small European and Baltic countries that rec 70%+ of their gas from \nRussia. Germany gets 30%. \nCross asset correlations outside of the US are increasing past few days - eg copper and the Turkish lira hourly charts are on top of each \nother past 4 days. I'm worried there is a 30-40pct(?) chance of a hard risk off move in markets in first half of next week - more focused \non European equities, copper, EM FX (Turkey, ZAR, Ruble etc) than SPX. In that scenario oil is way up. \nExchange WTI calls - there are 2 options (as of 3pm est): \n5day expiry 17march 2014 underlying clj4 97.92 \nand \n35d expiry 16apri12014 underlying clk4 97.59 \n** The 5 day options are a bit short - one possibility is sell a 3usd out of the money put (95.5 strike) for 20cents and buy a 2usd OTM \n100 call for 25. Net pay Scents. But 5d is a bit short for me. \n**For 35d expiry You could look at selling 91.50 (6usd OTM put) for 56cents and buying 103c (5.5usd OTM) for 58cents or the 102c \n(4.5usd OTM) for 76cents. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022260 \nCL1 <comdty> OMON on Bloomberg has live strikes and bid/ask. \nIf 5d is too short and 35d is too long / not enough gamma, Tazia may be able to source liquidity from the street.
