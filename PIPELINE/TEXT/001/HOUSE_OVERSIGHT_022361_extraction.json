    "full_text": "﻿Blanche Lark Christerson\nManaging Director, Senior Wealth Planning Strategist\nTax Topics\n2013-05\n04/29/13\nFiscal Year 2014 Budget issued\nOn April 10 th , President Obama issued his Fiscal Year 2014 budget. Shortly thereafter, the Treasury\nDepartment issued its “Green Book,” which explains the tax provisions in the budget. Although most of\nthese provisions are familiar and have appeared in previous budgets, a few were new. Here is a selected\noverview of some of these provisions, most of which would apply (assuming Congress enacts them) as of\n2014:\n• Limit the value of certain tax benefits. As in previous budgets, the current budget proposes to limit\nthe value of various tax benefits so that they only reduce or shelter income that would be taxed at 28%\nor less. In other words, taxpayers with income that would be taxed at the 33%, 35% or 39.6% rate\nwould see tax benefits curtailed, including ALL itemized deductions (these include deductions for\nmortgage interest, charitable contributions and state and local taxes), tax-exempt municipal bond\ninterest, employer and employee contributions to employer-sponsored health insurance, employee\ncontributions to retirement plans such as 401(k)s, contributions to health savings accounts and Archer\nmedical savings accounts, interest on education loans and certain higher education expenses. Because\nan affected taxpayer’s pre-tax contribution to her retirement account would be taxed, the account’s\n“basis” would be increased accordingly.\nComments. This proposal is not new, but the basis adjustment for retirement accounts is an equitable\nprovision that was previously missing. Also, because the proposal would apply to income that is taxed\nat 33%, 35% or 39.6%, it would increase taxes on some of those President Obama has previously\npledged to insulate from higher taxes – namely, individuals with income under $200,000 or married\ncouples filing jointly with income under $250,000. That is, in 2013, the 33% tax rate applies to taxable\nincome in excess of $183,250 (single taxpayers), $203,150 (head of household) and $223,050 (married\nfiling jointly).\n• The “Buffett Rule.” To limit the advantage that high-income taxpayers enjoy from the preferential low\nrates on dividends and long-term capital gains, the budget proposes the “Fair Share Tax” (FST), a new\nminimum tax designed to ensure that taxpayers pay at least 30% on their adjusted gross income (AGI)\n(a credit for charitable contributions would be allowed). Translated, this means that if the taxpayer’s\n“regular” taxes (including certain credits, the alternative minimum tax and the new 3.8% surtax on net\ninvestment income) and payroll taxes didn’t reach 30%, the FST would make up the difference. The\nFST would be phased in starting at $1 million of AGI, and would be fully phased in at $2 million of AGI\n(these thresholds would be indexed for inflation as of 2015).\nComments. Taxpayers who already pay an aggregate 30% in regular and payroll taxes would not be\nsubject to the FST – but those who chiefly have income from qualified dividends and long-term capital\ngains (and therefore have lower than a 30% effective rate) would see a significant tax increase.\n• Restore the 2009 transfer tax parameters. Beginning in 2018, the transfer tax provisions that were in\neffect in 2009 would be restored. The top transfer tax rate would thus be 45% instead of 40%; the\nestate tax exclusion and generation-skipping transfer tax (GST) exemption would be $3.5 million, and\nthe gift tax exclusion would be $1 million (these amounts would not be indexed for inflation). In\ncomputing gift or estate tax liability with respect to these reduced exclusions, taxpayers would not be\naffected by “clawback.” That is, they wouldn’t be subject to additional tax if they had taken advantage of\nthe previous (higher) exclusion amounts (in 2013, the applicable exclusion amount (AEA) against gift\nand estate tax is $5.25 million, and is indexed for inflation; the GST exemption equals the AEA).\n“Portability,” which allows a surviving spouse to effectively “inherit” the deceased spouse’s unused AEA,\nwould continue.\nComments. Despite President Obama’s urging to the contrary, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of\n2012 (ATRA), enacted on January 2, 2013, made permanent most of the transfer tax provisions that\nwere in effect in 2011 and 2012: a $5 million exclusion amount, indexed for inflation, against gift and\nestate taxes and GST, and portability. (ATRA increased the top transfer tax rate from 35% to 40%.) In\nother words, Congress just “permanently” stabilized transfer taxes, and is probably not eager to revisit\nthem anytime soon. Yet the budget proposes relitigating the issue, and reverting to the 2009 regime –\nbut not until 2018. Perhaps this is more protest than blueprint.\n• Require consistent basis for transfer tax and income tax. The basis of inherited property would\nhave to equal the property’s estate tax value, and the basis of property received by lifetime gift would\nhave to equal the donor’s basis. Although these are, in fact, generally the current rules, the proposal\nwould require executors of estates and donors of lifetime gifts to report the property’s value and basis to\nboth the recipient and the IRS.\n• Require a minimum term for Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs). To limit the effectiveness\nof GRATs, which are designed to pass potential appreciation at little or no gift-tax “cost,\" GRATs would\nbe required to have: 1) a minimum term of 10 years and a maximum term of the annuitant’s life\nexpectancy plus 10 years; 2) at least some gift at the trust’s creation (i.e., no more “zeroed-out” GRATs);\nand 3) no declining annuity during the trust’s term.\n• Limit the duration of the GST exemption. A trust that is protected from generation-skipping transfer\ntax would lose that protection after 90 years, when GST would again apply to the trust.\n• Coordinate income and transfer tax rules regarding grantor trusts. The grantor of a “grantor trust”\nis responsible for paying the trust’s income taxes. Such trusts are often includible in the grantor’s estate\n(as in a “revocable trust” or a GRAT). A trust that is not includible in the grantor’s estate but for which\nthe grantor is responsible for paying the income taxes is a “defective” grantor trust. Transactions\nbetween the grantor and his grantor trust are not recognized for income tax purposes, so that if, for\nexample, the grantor sells appreciated property to a defective grantor trust in exchange for an interest-\nTax Topics 04/29/13 2\nbearing note – known as a “sale to a defective grantor trust” – the sale does not trigger capital gains\ntaxes and the grantor is not taxable on the trust’s interest payments to him. Such transactions can pass\nsignificant potential appreciation to the grantor’s heirs free of gift tax and generation-skipping transfer\ntax.\nTo eliminate this planning technique, the proposal provides that if the deemed income tax owner of a\ntrust (this could be the grantor or a beneficiary) “engages in a transaction with that trust that constitutes\na sale, exchange, or comparable transaction,” then the portion of the trust attributable to this transaction\n(along with income or appreciation on the property): 1) would be includible in the deemed owner’s\nestate; 2) would be subject to gift tax if the deemed owner ceased to own the trust during life; and 3)\nwould be treated as a gift from the deemed owner if, during the owner’s life, distributions were made\nfrom the trust to another person. Any gift or estate tax triggered by the proposal would be payable from\nthe trust. The proposal would not apply to trusts that are already includible in the grantor’s estate, “rabbi\ntrusts” (non-qualified deferred compensation plans that are subject to claims of the grantor’s creditors) or\ntrusts that are grantor trusts solely because the trust’s income can be used to pay insurance premiums\non the life of the grantor or the grantor’s spouse (i.e., insurance trusts that are designed to remove\ninsurance proceeds from an insured’s estate).\nComments. Last year was the first appearance of this proposal to unify income and transfer tax rules\nfor grantor trusts. It was so broadly worded that it would have caught existing trusts, such as insurance\ntrusts. This new iteration simply targets sales to defective grantor trusts.\n• Extend the lien on estate tax deferrals. The tax law allows the estate tax on certain closely held\nbusiness interests to be deferred for up to 15+ years from the decedent’s death. Another provision of\nthe tax law imposes what is generally a ten-year lien on the estate’s assets to ensure payment of the\nestate tax. Because that lien can expire before the estate tax is paid, it may be difficult for the IRS to\ncollect those tax dollars. The proposal would extend the lien through the permitted deferral period.\n• Clarify the GST treatment of “HEETs.” Donors can make direct payments of tuition and medical\nexpenses free of gift tax. If that donor is a grandparent, for example, such payments are also free of\ngeneration-skipping transfer tax. Specifically, the tax law provides that the GST will not apply to “any\ntransfer which, if made inter vivos by an individual [i.e., during the donor’s life], would not be treated as a\ntaxable gift” because it is a direct payment for tuition or medical expenses. This language has been\nread to mean the following: GST will not apply to a trust’s direct payments for, say, a grandchildbeneficiary’s\ntuition or medical expenses, even though the trust is otherwise subject to GST.\nSome planners have taken this understanding a step further with “HEETs,” or Health and Education\nExclusion Trusts. These trusts purportedly are fully protected from GST, despite not having any GST\nexemption allocated to them. That is, because charity has an ongoing “substantial” income interest in\nthe HEET (say, 10%), gifts into the trust are not subject to GST, and GST won’t apply when one\ngenerational level of beneficiaries dies off. In addition, trust distributions on behalf of beneficiaries such\nas grandchildren can only be made for tuition or medical expenses, and are therefore GST-exempt. The\nproposal says that it would “clarify” that this GST exclusion for direct payments of tuition or medical\nexpenses only applies to payments made by a living donor, and not from a trust. The proposal would\napply to trusts created after the bill proposing this change is introduced in Congress, and to transfers\nafter that date made to pre-existing trusts.\nComments. The desire to \"clarify\" this special exclusion reflects the perception that HEETs are\nabusive, given the proposal’s recommended effective date (introduction, rather than enactment, of\nlegislation). Despite this perception, however, it is worth noting that trusts that typically take advantage\nTax Topics 04/29/13 3\nof direct payments for tuition and medical expenses are subject to GST but for this special exclusion.\nAlso, although HEETs have been written about in planning publications, it is unclear how often they are\nactually implemented: donors who use their GST exemption for multi-generational trusts often feel that\nthey’ve done “enough” for those lower generations, and may lack the charitable intent necessary for the\nHEET to work. In addition, given life’s uncertainties, trust creators may be reluctant to limit trust\ndistributions to tuition and medical expenses only.\n• Tax “carried” (profits) interests as ordinary income. In exchange for their services on behalf of\nhedge funds and private equity funds, managers of these entities are often compensated with what are\ncalled “carried interests,” or profits from the entity. Because these profits interests are structured as\npartnership interests, they pass through long-term capital gain to the partners/managers, and are\ntherefore taxed at preferential rates. The proposal would not recharacterize the treatment of a partner’s\ninvestment in the entity, but would tax as ordinary income what is viewed as compensation for the\npartner’s investment management services for the partnership. Thus, a partner’s share of income in an\n“investment services partnership interest” (ISPI), regardless of how the income is characterized at the\npartnership level, would be taxed as ordinary income, and would also be subject to self-employment tax.\nAn ISPI is an interest in future profits of an “investment partnership”; an investment partnership is one in\nwhich substantially all of the entity’s assets are investment-type assets, such as certain securities, real\nestate, interests in partnerships, commodities, cash or cash equivalents, or derivative contracts related\nto those assets.\n• Tighten up conservation easements. Donors of conservation easements typically get a charitable\ndeduction for the permanent restrictions they put on property that will be used exclusively for\nconservation purposes. Recent court decisions have upheld large deductions for easements preserving\nrecreational amenities, including golf courses, surrounded by upscale homes. These contributions have\nraised concerns that the deductions claimed are excessive and seem to promote private interests rather\nthan bona fide conservation activities. The proposal would prohibit a deduction for a conservation\neasement on a golf course. A second proposal would address historic preservation easements, and\nwould disallow a deduction for restricting the “upward development” of an historic building, since such\ndevelopment is typically already restricted under local ordinances. In addition, conservation easements\non buildings listed in the National Register would need to comply with the same (more stringent) rules\napplicable to buildings in a registered historic district.\n• Limit protracted payout for non-spouse beneficiaries of IRAs and retirement plans. Under current\nlaw, a non-spouse beneficiary of an IRA or a retirement plan (such as a 401(k)) must begin taking\n“required minimum distributions” (RMDs) from the account the year after the account owner’s death, but\ncan spread those distributions out over her life expectancy. Thus, if widowed Mom names Child as\nbeneficiary of her IRA, for example, and Child is 40 when Mom dies, Child’s RMDs can last over 40\nyears, assuming those are the only distributions Child takes from the account. The proposal would\nchange this rule, and in general would require that non-spouse beneficiaries withdraw the balance of the\nretirement account within five years after the owner’s death. (Certain exceptions would apply for\n“eligible” beneficiaries, such as those who are disabled, chronically ill or a child under the age of\nmajority.) The reason for the proposed change is that retirement accounts were intended to benefit\nowners and their spouses, and not heirs such as children and grandchildren.\nComments. It is not surprising to see this proposal, as last year, something similar was in a highway\nbill, but was then pulled. Given the need for revenue, limiting the generous protracted payouts currently\npermitted for non-spouse beneficiaries seems like low-hanging fruit. If enacted, the proposal would\npotentially make it less attractive for owners of substantial traditional IRAs to convert that IRA into a Roth\nTax Topics 04/29/13 4\nIRA, so as to provide, say, children and grandchildren with long-term income-tax free annuities.\nNevertheless, even if those beneficiaries had to take the balance of the Roth IRA within five years of the\nowner's death, they still would be receiving income-tax free dollars – something that would not be the\ncase if they had simply “inherited” a traditional IRA with its built-in income tax liability. In other words, by\nconverting a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, the owner is accomplishing something akin to what happens\nwith a defective grantor trust (see above): relieving the beneficiaries of an income tax liability they would\notherwise have to pay.\n• Limit the size of retirement benefits. Under current law, there are limits as to how much individuals\ncan accrue under a defined benefit plan (such as a pension plan), or how much they can contribute to\nIRAs and various defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. There are no limits, however, as to how\nmuch individuals can accumulate in these tax-preferred accounts. Because of this, the proposal\nexplains, individuals can accumulate more than is needed to fund “reasonable levels of consumption in\nretirement…well beyond the level of accumulation that justifies tax-advantaged treatment of retirement\nsavings accounts.” The proposal would therefore cap the size of a taxpayer’s various retirement\naccounts by barring additional contributions (or accruals) if, in total, the accounts exceeded what was\nnecessary to provide the maximum annuity permitted for a defined benefit plan: currently $205,000 per\nyear for a hypothetical 62 year-old and her spouse (this equates to accumulations of about $3.4 million).\nWhen a taxpayer’s accounts hit that ceiling, they could still grow through investment returns, but\nadditions to the accounts would only be allowed if the maximum permitted annuity increased, or the\ntaxpayer’s investment returns for a given year were less than the actuarial assumptions underlying the\nannuity. If an addition put a taxpayer’s accounts over the ceiling, the taxpayer would include that excess\nin income, and have a grace period to withdraw it; if the taxpayer did not withdraw the excess, then that\namount and attributable earnings would be subject to income tax when distributed, even if the\ndistribution was from a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k).\nComments. This new proposal seems to be a reaction to this fall's presidential elections and the\nsignificant retirement accounts of one of the contenders. Nevertheless, it is not an excise tax to whittle\ndown significant accounts, but a prohibition on additional contributions (or accruals). As Treasury\nSecretary Lew has pointed out, we’re not saying you can’t save for retirement, we’re just saying that\nsuch large amounts shouldn’t be tax-preferred. Still, will Congress really be inclined to limit how much\ntaxpayers can accumulate in their retirement accounts, especially when a rising interest rate\nenvironment would make the permitted accumulation smaller? Although anything is possible,\nparticularly if tax reform really comes about, Congressional sentiment might be against what could be\nviewed as “penalizing” successful savers.\n• Replace Consumer Price Index (CPI) with Chained CPI. Every year, the IRS issues inflation-adjusted\nnumbers for a variety of provisions, such as the income thresholds for the individual income tax rate\nbrackets, personal exemptions, and income thresholds and phase-out ranges for various deductions,\nexclusions and tax credits. The proposal states that the CPI overstates the effects of inflation because it\ndoesn’t fully reflect consumer reaction to price changes (as in, if prices go up, consumers will buy\nsomething cheaper). A “chained” CPI would “account more fully for this substitution effect” and better\nreflect changes in the cost of living. The proposal would take effect as of 2015.\nComments. Just as the proposal to limit tax benefits for income that would be taxed at higher than 28%\nwould raise taxes on some of those President Obama has previously pledged to protect (see above), a\nchained CPI would also raise taxes for everyone, in that tax brackets (and other tax benefits, such as\npersonal exemptions) would increase more slowly. Similarly, a chained CPI would reduce cost-of-living\nincreases for Social Security recipients – again something that would affect those the President has\npledged to protect. Although this proposal represents an attempt at balance, Republicans and\nDemocrats generally seem to dislike it, but for different reasons.\nTax Topics 04/29/13 5\nLegislative prospects? Where these proposals go may be a function of what happens with possible tax\nreform – and the prospects of that are…unknown. Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), Chairman of the House Ways &\nMeans Committee has been holding hearings, and issuing a number of legislative proposals that are\ndesigned to elicit comments and prod tax reform. Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman of the Senate\nFinance Committee, has also been pursuing tax reform, but has recently announced his retirement. Does\nthat put him in a better or worse position to achieve this goal? Time will tell. But trying to reconcile the\nRepublican desire for lower rates and a broader tax base with the Democratic desire for higher taxes on\nthose they feel can best afford them will not be easy. Considering the country’s pressing fiscal needs,\nhowever, it’s hard to imagine that tax revenues won’t have to go up at some point. The question is how, and\nwhose ox gets gored.\nMay 7520 rate issued\nThe IRS has issued the May 2013 7520 rate. It is 1.2%, a drop of 0.20% (20 basis points) from April’s rate\nof 1.4%. May’s annual, semiannual, quarterly and monthly mid-term rates are all 1%, a 0.09% (9 basis\npoints) drop from April’s annual, semiannual, quarterly and monthly mid-term rates, which were all 1.09%.\nBlanche Lark Christerson is a managing director at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management in New York\nCity, and can be reached at blanche.christerson@db.com.\nThe opinions and analyses expressed herein are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Deutsche Bank AG or any\naffiliate thereof (collectively, the “Bank”).
