You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 \nmillion dollars per year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, \nin various categories , a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range \nof all types of taxes. , planes. boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no \noversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. \nconstruction consultants bill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of llc's , including foreign, and with \nall that you only have a combined overhead of less that 3 million dollars. \nI have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with \nhighlights . I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to \nhave been raised as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an \nattempt to lay out issues that I fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't \ndo , - my responsibilities. etc and those things that are not, below you will find details of things that I \nthought needed to be done, so that you wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently \nfind yourself. however ,you chose to defer many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. \n! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 \n40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning that you needed to do something re personnel if it \nwere to stabilize,- you chose to wait. \nONE YEAR AGO \nFeb 17 2014 i wrote: \nWith regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very \nstrong inclination is not to be involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with \nmany pitfall many that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago \nthat the quality of the people involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way \nbefore the beginning of my involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship \nobligations of ok, -given all the complexities who else can do it? problem. \nYour family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping, \nnitpicking with little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take \ncharge Everyone would report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, \nby a long shot my first choice as I prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own \npersonal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer be transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) \nWith no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in \ntrying to think through the problem creatively . My organizations handling of the more complex \nissues I believe you might find very costly, very! ( however many structures available some risk \nsharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should \nbe only a trust, grat administrator, not sure what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to \noversee investments. whether Rich your controller stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a \nnew person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. \nThe increasing public profile needs to be taken into consideration. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023209 \nTODAY \nWith your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she \ncontinued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. \nand each time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! \nNo one was hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even \nnow , Brad, a very nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent \ntraining him. and his new staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to \nignore mine saying \" but Leon said \" or\" its on Leon's desk etc \" , You would become frustrated \nwhen i pointed out each instance, of her obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but \nto save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own \nteam. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in \nthe instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the weeks of grunt work \n),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation ,starting from \nwhere you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating down \nmy original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was \npartially my fault. ( though in that specific example , I had never been asked to do more than merely \nprovide you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked \nagain for my guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way \n„suggesting now, that your Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). \nhowever - that is all in the past. \nIn order to move forward \nI would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal \nattention and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues \nlast year. . As you are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I \nhave decided i will have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also \nask that you keep in mind that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your \nunderstanding of the final payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up \nyour way. ) I have answered every call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and \nover/ until once again, I was forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made \nserious dollar and time concessions last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate \nsome of your concerns , but I am, under no circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. \nits not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We \nwere both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you found yourself last year, and in fact due \npredominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took extra care in our negotiations . \n(you had claimed I had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with my very close friend.), \nunfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear of your \nown design ) \nI heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The \nart partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. \n. ( FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall \nthat you required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's.( \nmy work was never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of \ncourse should make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past \nagreement at all. I pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023210 \nright out of the box. you said you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in \nexcess of even my own exalted opinion of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my \nlimited amount of time-- way, way in excess of our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in \nthe amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. However, As my best student , and my only \none, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the required work yourself. I can put my \nwhiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,, share moments ideas etc. . I \nam of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route . always. It will take a \ngreat deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. \nWe are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning. \nDate: Wed, Nov 4, 2015 at 4:45 AM \nSubject: \nTo: Melanie Spinella \nokay, its time for you to decide how you would like to move forward. ( fyi get your money from the \n1031 . the screw up is only one of many,) If you decide to move foward on decanting. phaidon, note \nbasis estate update, each requires many carefully orchestrated detailed steps. and precision . there are \nhundreds of millions in saving if done correctly and a huge mess if not. If you want me and my \ncolleagues to do it, oversee it paper it and guide it, you should tell me. It is a big undertaking . If not, \nok.. Brad and your crew can do it. I will have no real further involvement apart from confirming the \noutcome of my proposed structure, I will not risk the admonition of- they thought you said, they thought \nyou meant, they understood it to be. but they said you said, ( i e ,I asked at our meeting that accounting \nbe done properly for bens house , what came back was ada thought that I meant that we needed to go \nback to the 97 trust and give him a full third party accounting of where his money had gone??!!

We are hoping to have signature pages to the trustees (and returned to us) by early to mid next week. \n(Ada will oversee.) \n4. We will then get the new trust to bofa who, moving quickly (according to them), will have an acct open \nthe following week, 12/7-9. \n5.

Joslins answers were totally incomprehensible. \nthe charts he prepared unreadable. Brads defensive posture was at a minum very surprising . He and I \nhave recently gotten along quite well , I thought. Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar \nnumber. no cash flow after weeks of requesting? odd. when you suggested that heathers behavior was \nemblematic of a sloppy office , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay, admittedly no change \nfor the year. . plane not done. though it was the only thing i suggested doing first in july . . I sent you a \nlist of 10 consultantts. brad said three, . i didnt want to push it. I was shocked that brad was opining on \nthings he knows little or nothing about. tax issues. 1031. neg basis , note payoffs ( the same idea he \nsaid he had had from the beggining??!!) . answers re LBF holdings that can be corrected ( they cant) . \nvaluations that have never been read. . When we met in your lobby he seems surprised that i was there. I \ndont know if he felt somewhat sandbagged. . . \nthe savings on the note payoff is aprrox 33 % of 1.8 billion, real money if you do phaidon which i see no \nreason not to. if later josh and ben want to buy it back with you or without you they can. i will walk you \nthrough the structure one on one. . the losses will offeset the calder gain as well as apollo gain. \nIm aware that seeing what you saw frustrated you. I felt badly for you. \nI> \nYou wanted a contingent deal. real value. etc. I will not of course hold you to your deal. . its silly. its \nnot how i work or a reflection of our friendship, my proposal is as follows. I want away from your \nbuisiness , but at the same time leaving you in good shape. I think you should pay the 25m that you did \nnot for this year. for next year its the same 40 m as always, paid 20 in jan and 20 in july, and then we are \ndone. I will give you advice and counsel but new people will be running your operating machine. I will \noversee all the work that needs to be done you and I will hire new people, and it will be self running ( it \nwas may in my house when you told brad it had been 5 months and you were getting fed up ) I will set up \na parallel. office, somenoe like wendy dolman or her quality is paramount. two accountants two \nbookeepers and two office admins. . alan and zoe will handle trusts and grats. heatehr diana george will \nbe incolved in art partnership. if you want brad, analysts etc. and kids to do investments I have little to \nadd in that regard ,except to be able to account for things properly.

I would suggest that Phaidons payroll and attention pales in \nimportance to your personal structure,which has taken a back seat, Some of my suggestions regarding \nthe Eysium office are as follows you will need a budget of 3- 5 million per year.

You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 \nmillion dollars per year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, \nin various categories , a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range \nof all types of taxes. , planes. boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no \noversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. \nconstruction consultants bill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of llc's , including foreign, and with \nall that you only have a combined overhead of less that 3 million dollars. \nI have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with \nhighlights . I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to \nhave been raised as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an \nattempt to lay out issues that I fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't \ndo , - my responsibilities. etc and those things that are not. below you will find details of things that I \nthought needed to be done, so that you wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently \nfind yourself. however ,you chose to defer many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. \n! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 \n40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning that you needed to do something re personnel if it \nwere to stabilize,- you chose to wait. \nONE YEAR AGO \nFeb 17 2014 i wrote: \nWith regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very \nstrong inclination is not to be involved at all . It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with \nmany pitfall many that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago \nthat the quality of the people involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way \nbefore the beginning of my involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship \nobligations of ok, -given all the complexities who else can do it? problem. \nYour family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping, \nnitpicking with little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take \ncharge Everyone would report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, \nby a long shot my first choice as I prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own \npersonal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer be transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) \nWith no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in \ntrying to think through the problem creatively . My organizations handling of the more complex \nissues I believe you might find very costly, very! ( however many structures available some risk \nsharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should \nbe only a trust, grat administrator, not sure what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to \noversee investments. whether Rich your controller stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023217 \nnew person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. \nThe increasing public profile needs to be taken into consideration. \nTODAY \nWith your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she \ncontinued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. \nand each time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! \nNo one was hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even \nnow , Brad, a very nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent \ntraining him. and his new staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to \nignore mine saying \" but Leon said \" or\" its on Leon's desk etc \" , You would become frustrated \nwhen i pointed out each instance, of her obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but \nto save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own \nteam. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in \nthe instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the weeks of grunt work \n),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation ,starting from \nwhere you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating down \nmy original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was \npartially my fault. ( though in that specific example , I had never been asked to do more than merely \nprovide you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked \nagain for my guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way \n„suggesting now, that your Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). \nhowever - that is all in the past. \nIn order to move forward \nI would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal \nattention and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues \nlast year. . As you are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I \nhave decided i will have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also \nask that you keep in mind that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your \nunderstanding of the final payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up \nyour way. ) I have answered every call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and \nover/ until once again, I was forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made \nserious dollar and time concessions last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate \nsome of your concerns , but I am, under no circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. \nits not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We \nwere both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you found yourself last year, and in fact due \npredominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took extra care in our negotiations . \n(you had claimed I had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with my very close friend.), \nunfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear of your \nown design ) \nI heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The \nart partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. \n. ( FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall \nthat you required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's.( \nmy work was never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023218 \ncourse should make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past \nagreement at all. I pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement \nright out of the box. you said you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in \nexcess of even my own exalted opinion of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my \nlimited amount of time-- way, way in excess of our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in \nthe amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. However, As my best student , and my only \none, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the required work yourself. I can put my \nwhiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,, share moments ideas etc. . I \nam of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route. always. It will take a \ngreat deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine . \nWe are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning. \nDate: Fri, Dec 11, 2015 at 12:19 AM \nSubject: Re: Fw: sched \nTo: \"jeevacationAgmail.com\" <jeevacationAgmail.com> \nCc: ' \n1______________________________________________________ \nJeffrey-joe tells me yau want this to go live on 12/21.

Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of details and \nmechanics I was not shown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between \nhe and his so called\" advisors\" however as he was out of the office during the most important \ntransaction of the year, I did get to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is \nwholly ludicrous - to summarize - the list I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a \npriority to get done after consulting with your office still remains virtually undone. \nIT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off \nexercises, - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, \n,consultants up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals \nreceived without brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he \nknows little of finance, is run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man, using \nyour power, to appear larger .

You asked me for my help. I told you multiple \ntimes that i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I preferred to have no financial interactions. I dont \nhave many friends and didnt want money to interefer with our unique relationship. For five years you had \nthe kind but goofy Eileen Alexandersson managing your accounting, legal, investments, reporting, trusts \netc. When I told you in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed she was incompetent you admonished \nme for\" speaking out of both sides of my mouth\" . With regard Brad Wechsler, there is no \" both sides. \n\". I have consistantly maintained since day one that he was highly unsuited for the job. When you initially \nasked me to help convince him to take the role , promising him a postion to manage mirage investments I \nsent you a note saying instead you should pay up and get first class people. I have reiterated the same \nmessage for over a year now. . Brad, not me was tasked with hiring new people and as you wanted him \nto take ownership of the staff,he conducted many interviews, you may recall that as late as may, you told \nhim in my presence that he had had six months and had not hired anyone. since then I have rectified \nerrors in sales tax, use tax, income tax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of deductions. ,( last nov \n) 11 million found in dormant accounts and 4 million in the drawer. errors in cash flow both personal and \nPhaidon. Oversight on new grats first at 22 and then at 19 that were done without my consulatation were \nresolved only as aresult of my intervention. . 600 million in after tax savings was just accomplished. \nWith Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his total and utter \nincompetence was brought clearly, front and center. He may be a step up from Eileen, but, if he is , then \nit is certainly not by much, A major difference is that Eileen knew she was over her head. Brad struts his \nstupiditly whenever he gets a chance. \nA critical example. - Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of \ncare and attention to details and mechanics with regard Phaidon I was not shown one single document, \nnot one.!! Brad wanted to keep it private between he, and his so called\" advisors\" however as he was \nout of the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get to spend time with joslin Joe \nand john, - the situation in your office is totally ludicrous - to summarize - the list I provided to Brad \nlast December - of things I thought were a priority to get done - still remains in the whole unresolved. \nThe IT, is virtually untouched and is still in desperate need of a format - reporting flawed cumbersome \nand inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off exercises , when either you or brad ask for it - airplane: re \nstructure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants up the kazoo but \nnothing at all done.( the office was told by Brad not to share the outside proposals with me - brad has no \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023226 \nidea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is bullshitted over by almost everyone in \nthe office. a little man, using your power, to appear larger . Eileen was self aware enough to know she \nwas over her head, that is a huge difference. bad info is rampant a simple emblematic example- 3 \nmillion in deductions Im told were taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out they cannot \nbe used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they said \nthat is the only real question you were focused on ! \" were they deducted \" not 2 is there a benefit\" !! \nI asked for the balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your \nfinancials. \"sorry we never got one?\" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing!, a construction \nproject run amok, no budget, the coo fired after only 3 months. , no clue. fyi artspace financials are \nalso a total mess. ( no receivables ??). when i asked for a list of what got done and did not, i received the \nemail from Brad basicailly mind you own business, so much was promised. !!! \nAs in your words probably your closest friend and in order to turn the page. I hope the following to be \nconstructive \nHere is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. \ni suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain \na paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed you re their importance. THe Phaidon transaction \npapered and structured as contemplated DOES NOT WORK, its as simple as that. DOES NOT!! I \nsuggest again that you re-do bank loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as \nRichard is now no longer trustee. re- do will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. \npay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . \nreview amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some \nmoney to kids let them make decisions. , decide art division with children in attendance . have fire drill \ndone on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said \nthe only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., A \nstrategy of the use of art should be implemented. . you have tax consultants it consultants. plane \noperation consultant. . boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA, \nBRH , rationalize investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax \nprojections for 15 and 16, . deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell \nstock, art, deal with phaidon debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out \nand inbound issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends. \ncorporate tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, I still think you \nmight consider a Rothshcild bank transaction they have 150 b and a distribution network with no \nproducts , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK visa issue sooner rather \nthan later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , complex 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?! \nthe facts as i see them \nin June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then only after weeks, when \nyou delayed any detailed discussion of money wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I \nfully understand ) . you unilaterally changed changed our agreement.. 5m would be reserved for the \nfuture ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only a third. ( note : I'm confident that both \nthe debt, and the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining \nroom ,you were surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that \nI am assured that I will be properly compensated for my work when strategies are implemented. you may \nrecall that you appeared offended and said \" are you suggesting that i would go back on my word\" I \nsaid no , of course not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, \npeople tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay \nI included in this letter the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023227 \nout my understanding of the compensation for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just \ncompleted. though the number was great it was clear. When it appeared that the details could now be \nworked out I was the first to say, it is too much money, however. \nFrom day zero I proposed to discount to 50 - 60 million the fair price of the transaction just completed. \nincluding Phaidon. . though this amount was already substantially less than our agreed and negotiated \nformula. - I was never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. \nplane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed ( ie including keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding \ntill March ) ,I provided as you specifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed \nall documents that i was given access to.

( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and the art space investment will also \nlead to a write- off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i \nrequire most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I will be properly \ncompensated for my work when strategies are implemented. you may recall that you appeared offended \nand said \" are you suggesting that i would go back on my word\" I said no, of course not ! you are my \nclosest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it \nactually comes time for them to pay. \nI include below the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out \nmy understanding of the compensation agreed for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one \njust completed.ie 600m When it appeared that the transcation would and could go foward I was the \nfirst to point out that our agreement would cost you too much money, therefore \nmore details \nFrom day one I proposed to discount our agreement to a 50 - 60 million range. An extremely fair price \nfor all the transactions just completed. including Phaidon. - I was never told that this was out of \nrange. in fact, alternative methods of payment . ie my plane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed ( ie \nincluding keeping the 30m portion of the fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided , only because you \nspecifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given \naccess to. ( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections . ( as i said more \nneeded on phaidon ) . I was then told that Alms involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best \nof light , though it is beyond question that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever \nproposed a unique idea. (including any way to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most \nbasic review of your largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to \nthe plan and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large \namount unless they were wearing a clown suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated \nwith the deal was known . It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, \na detailed execution plan was provided. then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for \nthe group to follow You told me that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only \n20m would be paid, (and even that was more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions . \nLeon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023231 \nyou I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. I would like to send him this email, with \nyour consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated , i would not be owed a dime, \nhowever , the expected fee was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and \noverseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the transaction had even begun, had already \nbeen heavily discounted, out of friendship, . I believe the decision re only paying 20 m has frankly, left \nme felling quite uneasy. and colors the view about the Athene or Rothschild transaction. \nDate: Fri, Jan 29, 2016 at 2:39 PM \nSubject: \nTo: Melanie Spinella <____________________________ \nyou've agreed that \nYour office is a multi billion dollar responsibility, your children will inherit it , in order to oversee their \nfinancial lives- I feel for you, truly ,but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has provided one bad \ndocument after another for over a year , no getting away from it,, bad cash flows no new IT, each \ntime with\" its gettting better\" no in fact -! its not. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is \nludicrous. of course he didnt actually prepare the statements. - no ceo would ,- but over and over he \npresented them to you and me, after , holding them back for his personal review multiple times and after \nmultiple drafts. weeks of his editing, the consistant but \"inexplicable \"missing the obvious serious \nerrors .

I said it was a bad idea. you said you were going to do it anyway , I \nsaid and followed up in writing IT IS A MISTAKE. and added Please don't come back to me with \nanything suggesting otherwise , you and I should be clear I think it is wrong . A very strong NO. you of \ncourse can hire whomever you like. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023235 \nearly on I told you I thought Tom remarkably careless . Eilleen goofy and your art lawyer not well \ninformed to say the least. you told me Tom was a senior partner. Eileen had headed the trading desk, and \nRalph Lerner had to know what he was doing as he wrote the book. . I said I thought you deserved \nbetter ,should get better people and no , I am not an HR person. yesterday you told me that the reason \nyou have hired whomver you could find was to avoid being dependent on me. a decision by far, not the \nbest place to try to save money ) \nJoslin- who you say I hired. I neither found nor hired. With a two person given choice I approved joslin \nover some woman that eileen preferred. against my repeated advice you and eileen decided the pay range \nat under 300k. I told you at that time that I would personally pay the difference for a higher quality \nperson, that was years ago. I have sent over a hundred emails to you clearly saying he needs to be \nclosely managed by better professionals. initially , that referred to Eillen and Ada.and after, brad. john \netc. THere are many emails each and every month from me, telling you , he is slipping failing cracking \nfragile. . crazy, nuts, heading towards incompetence. Unless YOU- TAKE ACTION! when I pressured \nhim for accurate numbers , you told him, to tell me, that he works for you and NOT for me. . When I \ncontinued to press for accuracy from your office , you told me that they were now all afraid of me and i \nshould let brad communicate any requests, ( you now tell me \" we know what Brad is\"?). When I told you \nyou office needs to be reviewed and changed you told me i was being destructive rather than \nconstructive, when i ultimately confronted joslin, in an attempt to protect you, told him that his numbers \nwere wildly inaccurate , you told me that i had caused his ultimate resignation and now have an \naffirmative obligation to fill in the resultant gap. \nI did give you a bad number, and apologized as soon as i realized it. an error that was an embarrassment \nfor me, the fact that that the accurate number is still way below what you agreed to pay, has fallen by \nthe wayside.( the preposterous argument that the end of year transaction was Alans idea , which you now \nknow was not true and that me not receiving Phaidon documents was unexplainable, was your justification \nthough, for non - full payment ) \nHopefully You will recall that when you initially asked for my help. I declined repeatedly with the \nadmonition that that having a financial arrangement is fraught with danger and could complitcate our \nfriendship (as you will be unhappy paying what you will view as a large sum. while choosing to ignore \nthe financial benefits, ). In Bedford , I repeated my concern.

It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand \nyour desire to modifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me, just a bit more red., here let me \nshow you, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to \nmaintain it. I vigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work. . you describe me as zeus, i describe it \nas artist and a reaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you \nhave the right to paint over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours. \nI was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review \"some things.\" brad told \nme ,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was \nmy idea . Having them review things without even asking for my input, or let alone my direction ,is \nridiculous. but.. I guess you wanted to save money. ? \nThe audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking \nabout. ie. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there \n, joslin part time, but relied on. joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the \noffice's finance team, accounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your \ninterest. ( saving money again ?) its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible, it was the first \nthing on my list of things that were needed to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of, though its \nprophylactic quality has been discussed over and over during the past three years . computers do not read \nPage Six. the women at the IRS do. ! you said your motivation in keeping this group of part timers \nwas a consequence of the high cost of my artwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - \nnow \nIf you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH \nassignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not \nprogressed very far ).

Unfortunatley for us both, the price for \nmy works has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give \nyou a bad number when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made \nperfectly clear. that you have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work, but \nagain its value exceeds anything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please \nalso remember that you and i agreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big \ntransaction. \nOR, you can decide that brad , tom, and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they \ncan oversee your audits. they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought \nin but i would be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story. \n-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make \nno judgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them. not my role I am always on \nyour side on the table.

( gaming ) inaccuracies, ( cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the simple answer is \nthat at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like you ,also give points for effort. )- ! an elegant art partnership \ngone fallow. ??!!I and its core reason to exist. not used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why? no docs for \ndecantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last night, \" no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest \" . why \nwasn't Tom brought in, after 4 times of my incessant reminders your admonition etc. the trading \naccounts ? \nBarry Cohen is great. more like him please . \nyou asked, - I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they \nwere never going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands ? Brad at its head . you \ncan't as a ceo, have an accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing \naltogether and not notice, you and I saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper after \nonly a cursory glance. He told me he didnt know the details of his note?! , my guess is that he wanted to \npay less. no more than that, any other story is blather. its silly. Talk to richard yourself. \nre your estate. Yes another Brad issue - your will, needs revision, the tenants in common structure I \nassume Alan has carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the \nmore serious issues in an email but we can speak over the weekend. \nHow can I help? We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him, I would \nbear no responsibility \nDate: Thu, May 12, 2016 at 6:17 AM \nSubject: tight schedule lets try a set time to speak \nTo: Melanie Spinella <! _  \nLeon, you hired me to produce a work of art. it was not inexpensive, the value far exceeds any other \npiece in your collection.- by FAR. It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand \nyour desire to modifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me, just a bit more red., here let me \nshow you, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to \nmaintain it. I vigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work. . you describe me as zeus, i describe it \nas artist and a reaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you \nhave the right to paint over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours. \nI was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review \"some things.\" brad told \nme ,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was \nmy idea . Having them review things without even asking for my input, or let alone my direction ,is \nridiculous. but.. I guess you wanted to save money. ? \nThe audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking \nabout. ie. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there \n, joslin part time, but relied on. joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the \noffice's finance team, accounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your \ninterest. ( saving money again ?) its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible, it was the first \nthing on my list of things that were needed to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of, though its \nprophylactic quality has been discussed over and over during the past three years. computers do not read \nPage Six. the women at the IRS do. ! you said your motivation in keeping this group of part timers \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023246 \nwas a consequence of the high cost of my artwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - \nnow \nIf you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH \nassignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not \nprogressed very far ). Lots of paper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside \nteam will be brought in at my expense working for me and you. coming in for interviews and reviews, . \nsucession, technology, tax and compliance, investment reporting „ computerized timelines for filings etc. \n. household classifcations and reporting with a system of best practices. \nMy goal is clear - to end, not extend, our financial interactions, you will have a machine that works, it \nwill not be complexto oversee , to create it, is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price for \nmy works has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give \nyou a bad number when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made \nperfectly clear . that you have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work, but \nagain its value exceeds anything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please \nalso remember that you and i agreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big \ntransaction. \nOR, you can decide that brad, tom, and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they \ncan oversee your audits. they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought \nin but i would be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story. \n-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make \nno judgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them. not my role I am always on \nyour side on the table.

Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge \ndifference. bad info is rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer \nexamination it turns out they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they \nwere deducted on the return they said that is the question they get asked ! \" were they deducted \" not 2 \nis there a benefit\" !! I asked for the balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in \norder to check your financials. \"sorry we never got one?\" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, \na construction project run amok , no budget, the coo fired after only 3 months., no clue. I can add that \nartspace financials are also a total mess. \nAs your friend and in order totum the page. I will try to be constructive \nThe following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by \nme. \nI suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain \nthe paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you consider \nhaving the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023247 \nloans. no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re-\ndo will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. \nget rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put \nmore protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , \ndecide art division with children in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if \nyou and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his \nown. ( this is brads chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should \nenter a tenants in common agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it \nconsultants. plane operation consultant. . boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, \ndeal with TRA, BRH , rationalize investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . \nprepare tax projections for 15 and 16, . deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, \npledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, \ninsurance regs, out and inbound issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , \nqualified dividends, corporate tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, \nRothshcild bank, 150 b they have a distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller \nRothschild financial service, deal with UK visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen \nrequest re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?! \nthe facts as i see them \nin June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking \nabout the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved \nfor the future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both \nthe debt, and the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining \nroom ,you were surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that \nI am assured that I will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are \nimplemented. you may recall that you appeared offended and said \" are you suggesting that i would go \nback on my word\" I said no , of course not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that \nwhen amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. \nFrom day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . \nthough this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was \nnever told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were \ndiscussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a \ndetailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon \nwas not forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alms involvement \nwarranted a discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one \ntime in three years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and \nlets say he made a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a \nlarge amount unless they were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was \nknown . It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed \nexecution plan was provided. then and only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a \nnumber of conversations with brad karp that only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than \noriginally contemplated ) for both transactions . I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of \nour prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp \nsit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of \ncourse. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be owed a dime, however , the price \nwas known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the price that had \nbeen requested before the transaction was begun, and had lready heavily discounted, out of friendship, \nfrom our agreement . I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has franldy left me felling quite uneasy. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023248 \nsince you asked since last nov. i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in \neileens drawer.. went through cash flows for phaidon shwoing that john murphy is not an accountant. \nredid your gagosian contract , . organized structure in case of divorce, set up gift trust. stopped ada from \nincluding multiple times things not in your interest, dealt with bad sales tax use tax income tax . created \n8 millino in deductions ,500k in mistakes , found bank of scotland fbar problems,. . reorg bad art \npurchases, funds taken„ charibale decustions , helped with fincnacil sttment gamoing commions fling.. \nboat deductions, rescued stock from grats. . may 1 after months of brad not finding anyone i sent an \nemail saying you would have to pay more. . on april 15.

When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before \nhim. what would you like me to tell Barry? \nThere is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work \nthat i outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it \nagain if you like ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very \nsame thing for a long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning \nthere was Eileen and Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was \nchosen from a pool of 2 people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally \naugmented his comp in order to get him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, \nHe complained for over a year , re his direction by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was \nnot a surprise after months and moths of warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with \njohn and joe. He ran amok, and as i told you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you \ntold him that he works for you and not for me and that brad needs to pays him . \n. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : \nI have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up \nquestions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) \nbut somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the \ntask, you bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year, that by \ntrying to protect you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his \nwork. it then turns out that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and \ncontinued to make a really dangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though \nemail after email said, I take no responsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your \nresponse was that was my opinion was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan \nyou told me he was gone. however he too is still there, and a waste of money and space. \nMy time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023251 \nforeign funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions \nto make re my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit \nmuch time and make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced \nmess. \nThat being said, the tasks at hand are the following. \nYou have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully \nunwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It \nwould be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I \nam concerned re brad taking barrys place re XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn \nACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets. trust valuations, are all a part. Barry will need 2 \nmonths to just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed modifications., \na way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan . . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. llcs. bank accounts, \nfiling requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how \nthey fit into new plan. . \"\" planning art partnership engagement.. , airplane re-do. , buying \nanother. . ? boat sale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years over due. . an \naccounting system. fire john.. joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and. except for heather \neveryone should be replaced with new. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize, cash \nflow reporting. cash mgmt. stock sales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take \nmonths to review now. . you CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. . CANNOT!!! this will \nbe very detailed work. . a self inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit. \nor contain it. . . you will need 3 new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I \nhave great hope in Barry as you know. He will need to be trained. note \n; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you, that you could do better than Halperin,: im \nglad that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the \nfact that after only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a \nyear or more. \nI expect as a friend you will understand that \nI will no longer, not even for one day, work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long \noverdue.. your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional, except me, not paul \nweiss ,( caesars alone, a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin„ no one. needs to end. . you and I \nhad previously agreed no more of that, and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be \nfair I can not say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of \nmoney, you wont want to pay, so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge \nIf I can find the time to work, on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I \nhope you understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well \ndocumented so as to avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more \nuncomfortable money moments with you , I find it very distasteful. . so to be clear , my terms are as \nfollows. I will only work for the usual 40 million per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing \nan agreement. 5 million every 2 months thereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin if i \nam able in January. I will immediately stop work, if the payment is not received. If you want me to \nwork this year until Jan 15 , it will be 10 million, paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a \nnew estate plan a running office. staffed with professionals overseen by Barry. ( hallelujah ) a tax plan . \nand an investment that returns more than any painting you could possible own. . no agreement - no \nwork. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the hour that i promised , and take your guidance as \nto what I should say. \nDate: Tue, Nov 29, 2016 at 1:27 AM \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023252 \nSubject: so there is no  misunderstanding  \nTo: Melanie Spinella < L> \nI have told the brads and barry,- I am done. its not a negotiation, out!! - fyi given my carlyn joslin \ncastrucci, admonishments,- though my involvement in those - in one instance only gave a name - in \nanother only given an eileen dictated choice btween two 250k preparers. and for castrucci, I actually \nsent emails that i take no responsiblity for his being hired. - however you felt strongly that I should be \nsaddled with their outcomes .even with brad wechsler, i again said two months in, Leon, he doesnt get \nit. I tell you this so that you will understand that I will not interview, recommend or vet any new hire. \nA story - In 1993 trump and I had a friend that kept telling his pilots how to fly, and when to fly, he \ncouldnt help himself from hiring morons as co pilots, and maintenance people based on cheapest rates. \nDonald and I tried and tried to talk some sense into him, to no avail. Donald and I were in aspen, sitting \nat little nells. when the friends plane crashed into the side of aspen mountain , klliing him and all on \nboard,- Trump looked at me and said without a blink , I guess NOW he wishes he would have listened to \nus.- a metaphor for your office. . . had we not waited to the very last hour having had a six month \nwindow and tens of unasnwered text and emails re decisions needed including the 1031. you would have \nsaved way more than you often feel obliged to argue about. . silly but i reallize you are stressed. \nBarry will need to sit with brad for months, to absorb all the co's, structures. cash flow, financial \nstatments etc. I will present barry my thoughts on the overall redo , it will be the exact same email that i \npresented to you and brad two years.ago . accurate numbers first. and foremost. . ( last week gaming \nreport stil funky).

You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 \nmillion dollars per year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, \nin various categories , a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range \nof all types of taxes. , planes. boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no \noversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. \nconstruction consultants bill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of llc's , including foreign, and with \nall that you only have a combined overhead of less that 3 million dollars. \nI have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with \nhighlights . I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to \nhave been raised as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an \nattempt to lay out issues that I fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't \ndo , - my responsibilities. etc and those things that are not, below you will find details of things that I \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023253 \nthought needed to be done, so that you wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently \nfind yourself. however ,you chose to defer many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. \n! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 \n40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning that you needed to do something re personnel if it \nwere to stabilize,- you chose to wait. \nONE YEAR AGO \nFeb 17 2014 i wrote: \nWith regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very \nstrong inclination is not to be involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with \nmany pitfall many that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago \nthat the quality of the people involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way \nbefore the beginning of my involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship \nobligations of ok, -given all the complexities who else can do it? problem. \nYour family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping, \nnitpicking with little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take \ncharge Everyone would report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, \nby a long shot my first choice as I prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own \npersonal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer be transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) \nWith no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in \ntrying to think through the problem creatively . My organizations handling of the more complex \nissues I believe you might find very costly, very! ( however many structures available some risk \nsharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should \nbe only a trust, grat administrator, not sure what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to \noversee investments. whether Rich your controller stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a \nnew person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. \nThe increasing public profile needs to be taken into consideration. \nTODAY \nWith your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she \ncontinued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. \nand each time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! \nNo one was hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even \nnow , Brad, a very nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent \ntraining him. and his new staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to \nignore mine saying \" but Leon said \" or \" its on Leon's desk etc \" , You would become frustrated \nwhen i pointed out each instance, of her obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but \nto save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own \nteam. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in \nthe instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the weeks of grunt work \n),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation ,starting from \nwhere you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating down \nmy original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was \npartially my fault. ( though in that specific example , I had never been asked to do more than merely \nprovide you the name of the most highly recognized ally in the field, not consulted,nor even asked \nagain for my guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way \n„suggesting now, that your Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). \nhowever - that is all in the past. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023254 \nIn order to move forward \nI would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal \nattention and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues \nlast year. . As you are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I \nhave decided i will have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also \nask that you keep in mind that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your \nunderstanding of the final payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up \nyour way. ) I have answered every call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and \nover/ until once again, I was forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made \nserious dollar and time concessions last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate \nsome of your concerns , but I am, under no circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. \nits not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We \nwere both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you found yourself last year, and in fact due \npredominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took extra care in our negotiations . \n(you had claimed I had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with my very close friend.), \nunfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear of your \nown design ) \nI heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The \nart partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. \n. ( FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall \nthat you required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's.( \nmy work was never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of \ncourse should make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past \nagreement at all. I pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement \nright out of the box. you said you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in \nexcess of even my own exalted opinion of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my \nlimited amount of time-- way, way in excess of our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in \nthe amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. However, As my best student , and my only \none, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the required work yourself. I can put my \nwhiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,, share moments ideas etc. . I \nam of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route. always. It will take a \ngreat deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. \nWe are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning. \nDate: Tue, Mar 21, 2017 at 6:58 PM \nSubject: Fwd: request for docs - AAP \nTo: Richard Kahn Darren Indyke <_ \nnot for now. but maybe later , \n----------Forwarded message---------- \nFrom: Ada Clapp <WIMPPI> \nDate: Fri, Mar 17, 2017 at 10:45 AM \nSubject: RE: request for docs - AAP \nTo: \"Barry J.

Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of details and \nmechanics I was not shown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between \nhe and his so called\" advisors\" however as he was out of the office during the most important \ntransaction of the year, I did get to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is \nwholly ludicrous - to summarize - the list I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a \npriority to get done after consulting with your office still remains virtually undone. \nIT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off \nexercises, - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, \n,consultants up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals \nreceived without brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he \nknows little of finance, is run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man, using \nyour power, to appear larger . Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head, that is a huge \ndifference. bad info is rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer \nexamination it turns out they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they \nwere deducted on the return they said that is the question they get asked ! \" were they deducted \" not 2 \nis there a benefit\" !! I asked for the balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023256 \norder to check your financials. \"sorry we never got one?\" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, \na construction project run amok , no budget, the coo fired after only 3 months., no clue. I can add that \nartspace financials are also a total mess. \nAs your friend and in order totum the page. I will try to be constructive \nThe following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by \nme. \ni suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain \nthe paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you consider \nhaving the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank \nloans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re-\ndo will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. \nget rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put \nmore protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , \ndecide art division with children in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if \nyou and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his \nown. ( this is brads chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should \nenter a tenants in common agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it \nconsultants. plane operation consultant. . boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, \ndeal with TRA, BRH , rationalize investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . \nprepare tax projections for 15 and 16, . deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, \npledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, \ninsurance regs, out and inbound issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , \nqualified dividends, corporate tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, \nRothshcild bank, 150 b they have a distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller \nRothschild. financial service, deal with UK visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen \nrequest re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?! \nthe facts as i see them \nin June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking \nabout the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved \nfor the future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only S. ( note : I'm confident that both \nthe debt, and the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining \nroom ,you were surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that \nI am assured that I will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are \nimplemented. you may recall that you appeared offended and said \" are you suggesting that i would go \nback on my word\" I said no , of course not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that \nwhen amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. \nFrom day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . \nthough this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was \nnever told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were \ndiscussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a \ndetailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon \nwas not forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement \nwarranted a discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one \ntime in three years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and \nlets say he made a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a \nlarge amount unless they were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023257 \nknown . It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed \nexecution plan was provided. then and only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a \nnumber of conversations with brad karp that only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than \noriginally contemplated ) for both transactions . I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of \nour prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp \nsit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of \ncourse. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be owed a dime, however , the price \nwas known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the price that had \nbeen requested before the transaction was begun, and had lready heavily discounted, out of friendship, \nfrom our agreement . I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly left me felling quite uneasy. \nsince you asked since last nov. i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in \neileens drawer.. went through cash flows for phaidon shwoing that john murphy is not an accountant. \nredid your gagosian contract , . organized structure in case of divorce, set up gift trust. stopped ada from \nincluding multiple times things not in your interest, dealt with bad sales tax use tax income tax . created \n8 millino in deductions ,500k in mistakes , found bank of scotland fbar problems,. . reorg bad art \npurchases, funds taken„ charibale decustions , helped with fincnacil sttment gamoing commions fling.. \nboat deductions, rescued stock from grats. . may 1 after months of brad not fmding anyone i sent an \nemail saying you would have to pay more. . on april 15.

I do not know how, and if ,to move forward - our last transaction. a transaction \nwhich you saved 600 million in tax. even if 20 years away, ( i hope longer) even discounted is a 300 \nmillion savings . for that you ignored our agreements , verbal written and emailed -and decided that it \nwas only worth 8 million dollars. ( assuming phaidon srichard happens. 24 m savings not including \nartspace and debt benefits certain to come later ) FYI the phaidon transaction cannot happen as \ncurrently comtemplated IT will not work . NOT \nWhen we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told you multiple \ntimes that i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I preferred to have no financial interactions. I dont \nhave many friends and didnt want money in any way to interfere with our unique relationship. Reminder, \nFor five years you had the kind but goofy Eileen Alexandersson as the sole manager of your accounting, \nlegal, investments, reporting, trusts etc. When I first told you in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed \nshe was incompetent you admonished me for\" speaking out of both sides of my mouth\" . With regard \nBrad Wechsler, there has never been a \" both sides. \". I have consistantly maintained since day one that \nhe was highly unsuited for the job. When you initially asked me to help convince him to take the role, \npromising him a position to manage mirage investments I sent you a note saying that instead of hiring him \nyou should pay up and get first class people. I have reiterated the same message for over a year now. . \nBrad , not me ,was tasked with hiring new people, according to his org chart.(nauseating ) and as you \nwanted him to take ownership of the staff,he conducted many interviews alone. . you may recall that as late \nas may, you told him in my presence that though six months had passed he had not hired anyone. since \nthen I have rectified errors in sales tax, use tax, income tax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of \ndeductions missed errors of millions on the returns. ,( april ) Oversight on new grats- first at 22 and then \nat 19 that were done without my consultation and needed to be resolved soley as a result of my last \nminute intervention. . 600 million in after tax savings was just accomplished, though you left the 30 \nmillion outstanding that I had said should only be done\" if' that was my additional fee. not used for non \nbiz purposes and not art. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023261 \nin June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout first projected at 20 . but less \nwhen artspace and debt taken out, - then only after weeks, when you delayed any detailed discussion of \nmoney wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully understand ) . you unilaterally \nchanged our agreement. . 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i \nwould receive only a third. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and the art space investment will also \nlead to a write- off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i \nrequire most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I will be properly \ncompensated for my work when strategies are implemented. you may recall that you appeared offended \nand said \" are you suggesting that i would go back on my word\" I said no, of course not ! you are my \nclosest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it \nactually comes time for them to pay. \nI include below the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out \nmy understanding of the compensation agreed for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one \njust completed.ie 600m When it appeared that the transcation would and could go foward I was the \nfirst to point out that our agreement would cost you too much money, therefore \nFrom day one I proposed to discount our agreement to a 50 - 60 million range. An extremely fair price \nfor all the transactions just completed. including Phaidon. - I was never told that this was out of \nrange. in fact, alternative methods of payment. ie my plane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed ( ie \nincluding keeping the 30m portion of the fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided, only because you \nspecifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given \naccess to. ( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections . ( as i said more \nneeded on phaidon ) . I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best \nof light , though it is beyond question that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever \nproposed a unique idea. (including any way to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most \nbasic review of your largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to \nthe plan and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large \namount unless they were wearing a clown suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated \nwith the deal was known . It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, \na detailed execution plan was provided. then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for \nthe group to follow You told me that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only \n20m would be paid, (and even that was more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions . \nLeon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that \nyou I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful..

When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before \nhim. what would you like me to tell Barry? ' \nThere is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work \nthat i outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it \nagain if you like ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very \nsame thing for a long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning \nthere was Eileen and Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was \nchosen from a pool of 2 people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally \naugmented his comp in order to get him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, \nHe complained for over a year, re his direction by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was \nnot a surprise after months and moths of warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with \njohn and joe. He ran amok, and as i told you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you \ntold him that he works for you and not for me and that brad needs to pays him . \n. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc.: \nI have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up \nquestions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) \nbut somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the \ntask, you bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year, that by \ntrying to protect you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his \nwork. it then turns out that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and \ncontinued to make a really dangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though \nemail after email said, I take no responsibility for him, and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your \nresponse was that was my opinion was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan \nyou told me he was gone. however he too is still there, and a waste of money and space. \nMy time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the \nforeign funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions \nto make re my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit \nmuch time and make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced \nmess. \nThat being said, the tasks at hand are the following. \nYou have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully \nunwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It \nwould be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023264 \nam concerned re brad taking barrys place re XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn \nACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets. trust valuations, are all a part. Barry will need 2 \nmonths to just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed modifications., \na way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan . . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. llcs. bank accounts, \nfiling requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how \nthey fit into new plan. . \"\" planning art partnership engagement.. , airplane re-do. , buying \nanother. . ? boat sale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years over due. . an \naccounting system. fire john.. joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and. except for heather \neveryone should be replaced with new. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize, cash \nflow reporting. cash mgmt. stock sales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take \nmonths to review now. . you CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. . CANNOT!!! this will \nbe very detailed work. . a self inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit. \nor contain it. . . you will need 3 new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I \nhave great hope in Barry as you know. He will need to be trained. note \n; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin,: im \nglad that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the \nfact that after only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a \nyear or more. \nI expect as a friend you will understand that \nI will no longer, not even for one day, work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long \noverdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional, except me, not paul \nweiss ,( caesars alone, a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin„ no one. needs to end. . you and I \nhad previously agreed no more of that, and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be \nfair I can not say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of \nmoney, you wont want to pay, so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge \nIf I can find the time to work, on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I \nhope you understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well \ndocumented so as to avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more \nuncomfortable money moments with you , I find it very distasteful. . so to be clear , my terms are as \nfollows. I will only work for the usual 40 million per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing \nan agreement. 5 million every 2 months thereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin if i \nam able in January. I will immediately stop work, if the payment is not received. If you want me to \nwork this year until Jan 15 , it will be 10 million, paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a \nnew estate plan a running office. staffed with professionals overseen by Barry. ( hallelujah ) a tax plan . \nand an investment that returns more than any painting you could possible own. . no agreement - no \nwork. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the hour that i promised , and take your guidance as \nto what I should say. \nher the last two places. ? \nTo: Melanie Spinella - \nLeon please read the attached proposed response to the IRS , see if you can understand it !!!. lye asked \nfor a re-do. and given prelimiary directions to Alan to have it edited over the weekend \n. If you are quarterbacking ,ok with me. just please let everyone know. you must deal with the \noutrageous incompetence in your family office.. Alans words \" but I was told that.., but I was told by \nthe office (sic) that ... , BUT i was told by joslin,. , but I was told by. \" why is leon blaming me for ..\" . \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023265 \nI ye have always given you my best advice, If you reflect on your financial life, you have been kept safe, \nhad remarkable results and no disasters. I have repeatedly urged you to get rid of the people in your \noffice. , you have repeatedly chosen to ignore my advice , you told me last week that the emotional \nreason was in order to be weaned off my group and not have to pay my high fees. ( though ignoring \nthe benefit of between 1.5 and 2b to the better. ) . and no explosions. You have email after email \n,where i remind you that I am not your bookkeeper or accountant ( in brads corporate speak his\" finance \ndept ??!!) that it should be redone .I have reviewed a multitude of the silly reports given to you and \nhave pointed out the continued numerous inaccuracies. your question\" so what if the numbers are off, \nso what if the categories are off. whats the big deal??. I suggest you de risk you finances and make the \ntough decisions necessary - pay the right amounts ( high) to get the work done properly or , you are, Im \nafraid, certain to get an unhappy answer.. tom will be back from vacation, this week. \n----------Forwarded mess7,-\nFrom: Halperin, Alan S 1_________________________> \nDate: Thu, Apr 28, 2016 at 5:16 PM \nSubject: Valuation Discount \nTo: \"jeffrey E.\" leevacation@gmail.com> \nI am attaching a draft response from Empire Valuation as to why it arrived at a valuation discount on the \nlow end.

You had wanted more comfort initially on the art \npartnership so that date was delayed.

I find them as tedious as you do. if you prefer a partnership structure, ok with \nme, I tried to minimize the amount of money i would recieve by making it a flat fee. as i wanted you to \nfeel good and have no second thoguths somehow if the payment comes from a partnership structure you \nseem relaxed as opposed to writing a check, I focus on trust and friendship first, and the fact that you \ndon't include josh and mark in that category, gives me great pause .

As you know, we have structured this \nagreement with the Buyer as either Narrows Holdings LLC or AP Narrows LP, and given both of those \nentities the right to assign the agreement to any one among Leon, Debra, the kids, or family trusts \nincluding AP01 and AP02. \nGagosian wants us to agree that, if Narrows/AP Narrows assigns the agreement to someone else, \nNarrows/AP Narrows \"shall not be discharged from its liabilities under this Agreement and \nshall remain primarily liable to Seller.\" Larry is concerned that we might assign to the \nBlack kids or to a trust that has no assets, and then when he has to sue us because we \ndon't make the final payment of the purchase price but have possession of the art, the \nentity/person to which we have assigned the agreement has no money. \nI think this is a valid concern and that we should agree to it. \nHowever, Ada just reminded me that it is possible that Narrows/AP Narrows (really, \nLeon's) agreeing to effectively guarantee payment by the assignee might be considered \na gift to the assignee. In the discussions with Alan about rearranging the bank loan once AP \nNarrows is operational, Alan agreed that there could be deemed to be a potential gift from Leon to \nAP01/AP02 if Leon provides a guarantee to the bank that is for the benefit of the trusts as partners in AP \nNarrows. Alan suggested mitigating this risk by having the trusts sign side agreements with Leon which \nsay that if AP Narrows defaults on the loan and the bank goes after Leon on his guarantee, the trusts will \nmake him whole. \nThis issue only arises if we assign the agreement. The risk is also limited in time because it would run \nfrom the moment we assigned the agreement until the final payment is made, which even if we assigned \nimmediately after signing, would only be 11 1/2 months. \nShall I agree to Gagosian's request that Narrows/AP Narrows remain liable even if they assign the \nagreement? \nI'm in the office if you would like to discuss this, but I would love to get back to Gagosian ASAP so we \ncan have this agreement signed today. \nThanks, \nHeather \nDate: Mon, May 11, 2015 at 3:08 PM \nSubject: \nTo: Brad Wechsler < , Melanie Spinella < >, Ada Clapp \n, Richard Joslin \nlets look at funding the art partnership begin with 100 m of unencumbered art. plus 20 inveestment. and \nthe same amoiunt of value from trust. leon should choose b trustee and begin to use mechanics. . later \nwe can amend and add. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023276 \n2 hire an IT person asap \n3.1 would hire jerry the woman. gittis. person \n4 .I will find a subpart k person to handle partnership acct \n5 , accounting software upgrade, onlilne banking needs to be seamless \n6. not sure status of bringing plane boat acct inhouse? \n7 prepare fbar report for june. draft next week \n8 pahidon actuals vs projections. . new valuation \n9. new valuation of tra contract? \njpm db goldman sachs acct? new llc? \nreview of dec 31 books for all entities? bfp . etc \nDate: Wed, May 13, 2015 at 3:04 PM \nSubject: Fwd: jobs ahead \nTo: Melanie Spinella \nthe list that we discussed.. i spent time with brad again. re the candidates . filling due, this week, next \nmonth,. \nDate: Sun, Dec 28, 2014 at 5:18 AM \nSubject: jobs ahead \nTo: Brad Wechsler \n>, Melanie Spinella >, Ada Clapp \n1. review accounting system.

I said ok, but..... \" you told me to continue as we \nwould work something out\" I told you my fee then was 40. feb you came with ben while kathy ruemmler \nwas here. and said next week, debra got bad news. and I quickly prioritzed not adding stress to your \nsituation. I wont regurgitate the interim, though millions of dollars were saved since. millions. . it is now \none year later and you propose 10 mlllion , plus a contingent fee . I have said that i would work with \nyou, and if contingent and a percentage of something. I strongly believe that is not in your interest. I \ncontinue to put our friendship first and dont want you to write a check for over 100million andthe i will \nhave to listen to lewie for the next few years. but if you prefer over my objection a percentage deal then it \nshould be of all savings not just phaidon. ( a random concept) . The idea that i am somehow even \nmarginally responsible for neither you nor heather, ever telling me that there was an unresolved issue, \nthough you said you had been pinged a number of times is emblematic. \nI can do a call with you and Karp. anytime you like today, but i can assure you 100 percent that there is \nno light between our positions.

START from total scratch. there is absolutely nothing worth \nkeeping in your family office except for heather , nothing at all . I remember when i bought my first \nhouse in order to renovate and jack robertson said forget it. knock it down start again, I could n't \nbelieve it. but he was right. Like your tax returns that were done in triplicate. TOM RICH ALAN. \ntom and rich were not really useful in the end. Alan was the only smart one. you should in my \nopinion Start a brand new office. hire cfo. bring joe over, heather and samantha, run parallel \nfor 6 months and close down the mess of elysium forever, leave your kids a functioning operation \nprofessionally constructed and managed. NOT BY ME!!! \nLAst nov i laid out priorities IT , being the first nothing as of today. in July I said focus on airplane \nas a test. to examine procedure and proficiency, so far mostly a waste of resources time people \netc. Only last week told debra owns 49 percent of plane. no IT to speak of. bens house \nunaccounted for. tax returns very very sloppy, . boat still argued as third home. . pilots bonuses?, \nstructure unkown by all. cash sitlling at the same time loans outstanding. \nPhaidon, looks like close to breakeven in a few years. others totally unknown. Query, do you \nreally want this ? : I m not sure how you both want to have an investment office and have cash flow \nbeing eaten by publishing and loans amounts outstanding increased by art. --interest rates will be \ngoing up.- . your plane will cost 10 million to refinance - so will boat if sold next year-. art space and \nregan , both needs more cash. with little return, taxes , art purchases. Part of radical solutition is to \nsell publishing.altogether. (are the children really interested.) . restrucuture plane from scratch. \nlayers unncessary. simplify crazy structure s bank accounts trading accounts accounts payble. credit \ncards. etc. The best way to wean yourself away from me is to have someone else do the whole thing \nfrom scratch. . move brad to be the replacement for Richard. . he is nice but this is not what he does. \nHim saying it is s0000 flicked up to me , was only an echo of me sayint it to you. . \nSubject: \nTo: Melanie Spinella .MINIM \nas brad can attest, I spent time today with joslin, joe. etc. no question at all, a failed experiment.

At the time, we discussed the merits of using a gallery versus a \ncommercial exchange agent and my recommendation to Leon was to use a \ngallery. I felt that there were advantages to using a commercial exchange agent \ninstead of a gallery on the 1031 side (e.g., less likelihood of a breach of \nconfidentiality, IRS familiarity with CDEC in the event of an audit, security of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023285 \nfunds), but that a commercial exchange agent gave us less comfort on the sales \ntax side. Leon did not want to use a gallery because he was concerned about \nconfidentiality and he did not want to have to ask a gallery that he did not do \nmuch business with to act as exchange agent. \nWhen Leon first discussed the exchange for the Cezannes with me a few \nweeks ago, I asked him if he wanted to use the same exchange agent as last \nyear, or if he wanted to use a gallery. I said that a gallery carried little to no risk \non the sales tax side, but I reminded him that he had not wanted to use a gallery \nlast year for the Calder because of confidentiality reasons. He said to use the \nsame exchange agent as before, which made sense to me because he was \nextremely concerned about confidentiality with the purchase of the Cezannes. \nI will find out about sales tax audits and will let you know. The exchange agent \nhas had a New York resale certificate since 2014 and has been engaged in art \ntransactions like this since then, but I do not believe they have been audited. I \nwill check, though, and I will also ask the Herrick lawyer if any of his clients who \nhave done similar deals have been audited. \nBest, \nHeather \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023286 \n"
