LEE \n• November 21 at 2:52 pm \nThe Bitcoin Foundation's Patrick Murck testifies before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. (U.S. \nSenate) \nThe pair of Bitcoin hearings held this week by Senate committees could have been a disaster for the \nBitcoin community. After all, Bitcoin first came to mainstream attention in 2011 when \nGawker reported on Silk Road, an anonymous online marketplace that allowed users to purchase a wide \nvariety of illegal drugs with Bitcoin. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) denounced the site and suggested \nthat Bitcoin was \"an online form of money laundering.\" A few months ago, it would have been easy to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029963 \nimagine the first congressional hearings on Bitcoin being a prelude to a federal crackdown on the \ndecentralized financial network. \nBut that's not what happened. Instead, the hearings were lovefests. All three Obama administration \nofficials who testified this week stressed that Bitcoin has legitimate uses and argued that no new \nregulations were needed to police illicit uses of the network. Most of the other witnesses echoed those \nsentiments. \nThat wasn't a coincidence. The cordial atmosphere of this week's hearings was the culmination of \nmonths of careful diplomacy by Bitcoin advocates. Since the spring, leaders of the Bitcoin community \nand sympathetic policy advocates have been engaging with federal regulators, lawmakers and other \ninfluential figures inside the beltway. The result: a near-unanimous consensus that the federal \ngovernment needs to be careful to avoid hampering the growth of the world's first completely \ndecentralized payment network. \nA tough crowd \nOn the morning of June 13, several dozen well-dressed Washingtonians filed into the Carlucci \nAuditorium at the stately headquarters of the United States Institute of Peace. For many of the \ngovernment officials in the room, this would be their first opportunity to meet senior figures in the \nBitcoin community in the flesh. Panelists included lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andressen and \nPatrick Murck, general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation. \nThe way the event was framed didn't augur well for Bitcoin. One of the conference's two sponsors \n(along with Thompson Reuters) was the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. A \nmajor theme of the second panel was the use of bitcoins to purchase child pornography. \n\"Child pornography is like Bitcoin in some ways,\" said Andrew Oosterbaan, who prosecutes child \npornography cases for the Justice Department. \"It has intrinsic value to people who want it. The more \nvaluable child pornography is the new child pornography. When you add an anonymous currency, \nyou've taken individuals who are already incentivized to produce, given them a far more meaningful \nincentive to do so.\" \n\"Bitcoin is nothing like child pornography,\" a visibly angry Murck shot back. \"If there was one \ninstance of a child being abused because of Bitcoin, that's one too many. I'm a father, I think there's a \nspecial place in hell for people who do that.\" \nBut Murck also stressed that the Bitcoin community was willing to work with federal regulators to \nensure that Bitcoin-based businesses complied with applicable laws. \"I want to craft a sane regulatory \nenvironment,\" he said, urging federal regulators to \"engage stakeholders. Don't have secret meetings. \nHave public meetings. We're all happy to live with the consequences of whatever rulemaking is open \nand transparent.\" \nMurck would get his wish for engagement, though many of the meetings would be held behind closed \ndoors. \"We always intended that conference to be a launching point,\" says Ernie Allen, the president \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029964 \nof the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children and an organizer of the June \nconference. The gathering catalyzed the creation of a task force to consider how policymakers should \nrespond to Bitcoin's emergence. It is expected to issue its recommendations early next year. \nAllen says that conversations among members of that task force have changed how he thinks about \nthe online payment network. Allen now believes that premature regulation would be \ncounterproductive. \n\"We are enthusiastic about the potential of virtual currencies and the digital economy,\" Allen said in \nhis Monday testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. \nAllen said he remained concerned about the use of the currency for exchanging child pornography, \nbut he warned that \"draconian\" regulations could push Bitcoin enterprises underground and \noverseas, where it would be much harder to police for illicit uses. \nThe Senate studies Bitcoin \nStaff on the Homeland Security Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), had been \npreparing for their Bitcoin hearing for several months. Committee staffers began to study the topic in \nearnest in April, when the value of one bitcoin spiked to $266, generating a wave of media attention. \nOver the summer, committee staff interviewed around 50 experts in industry, government, academic \nand nonprofit organizations to learn how the Bitcoin network worked and how it might affect the \neconomy and law enforcement. Committee staffers talked to government agencies, bankers, and \ntechnologists. They also talked extensively to representatives of the Bitcoin Foundation. \nThe committee consulted with Dan Kaminsky, a well-known security expert who conducted \nan influential security analysis of the Bitcoin software in 2011. Staffers talked to Sarah Meiklejohn, a \ncomputer scientist at the University of California, San Diego, about whether Bitcoin is truly \nanonymous (it isn't). And they talked to Jerry Brito, a researcher at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian \nthink tank. Brito testified at Monday's hearing. \nIn August, the committee sent a series of letters to federal agencies seeking their views on Bitcoin and \nother virtual currencies. Letters were sent to the Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury \nDepartment, the Federal Reserve, the Justice Department and other agencies with regulatory \nauthority related to financial markets or online crime. The letters asked the agencies to provide details \nof any inquiries they had conducted into the virtual currencies, and to describe whether they had \nplans to regulate the currency in the future. \nMeanwhile, representatives from the Bitcoin Foundation met with a number of executive branch \nofficials at a closed-door meeting in August. \"What the Bitcoin Foundation tried to stress is that \nBitcoin is less useful for [illicit] purposes than other centralized virtual currencies,\" said Brito, who \nattended the meeting. Bitcoin advocates also stressed that excessive regulation in the United States \nwould merely push more of the Bitcoin economy overseas, where U.S. regulators might not be able to \nreach it at all. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029965 \nThose arguments seem to have made an impression, because government officials repeated many of \nthem at this week's hearings. The Homeland Security Committee invited representatives of three \nfederal agencies to testify before the committee this week. Jennifer Shasky Calvery represented the \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network, which enforces the nation's laws against money laundering. \nMythili Raman spoke on behalf of the Justice Department, whose enforcement activities have \nincluded the shuttering the Bitcoin-based drug marketplace Silk Road. And Edward Lowery spoke for \nthe Secret Service, which (along with the Justice Department) was involved in shutting down e-Gold \nand Liberty Reserve, two virtual currencies that the government alleged had become vast money-\nlaundering operations. Calvery also testified before the Senate Banking committee on Tuesday. \n\"Virtual currencies have yet to overtake more traditional methods to move funds internationally\" for \n\"criminal purposes,\" Calvery said. She pointed out that the Bitcoin network has processed only about \n$8 billion worth of transactions over the last year, compared to an estimated $1.6 trillion in \"global \ncriminal proceeds\" in 2009. Clearly, the vast majority of those transactions are using some other \nfinancial network. \n\"We are attuned to the criminal use\" of Bitcoin, Raman said. But \"there are many legitimate uses. \nThese virtual currencies are not in and of themselves illegal.\" \nCalvery agreed. \"Innovation is a very important part of our economy,\" she said, cautioning that \npremature regulation could stifle Bitcoin innovation. \nThe personal touch \nRegulators are busy people. They're more likely to pay attention to flesh-and-blood advocates than to \nanonymous Internet commenters. Murck and Andresen's trip to Washington proved to be crucial to \nbuilding productive relationships with policymakers. \nCalvery was a keynote speaker at the June conference. Murck and Calvery met in the speakers' room \nat the conference and had a conversation that would later lead to the closed-door August meeting \nbetween regulators and Bitcoin advocates. The day after the June conference, Murck was introduced \nto staffers on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, beginning a conversation that culminated in \nthis week's hearings. \nMurck says that not everyone in the Bitcoin community was happy about his engagement with \nWashington. The Bitcoin community has a strong libertarian streak, and many Bitcoin devotees \nworried that conversations with federal regulators could help to legitimize and encourage regulation. \nBut to the surprise of many, the Bitcoin advocates' charm offensive actually changed the minds of \nmany D.C. insiders. Winning over Allen was a particular coup for the Bitcoin community. Allen's \nwarnings against the dangers of premature regulation were particularly effective coming from a long-\ntime activist against child pornography. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029966 \n\"Part of the effort was not just to address these issues from a law enforcement perspective, but to \nlisten to the leaders of the Bitcoin movement,\" Allen said. And when he listened to them, he found \nsome of their arguments to be surprisingly persuasive. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029967 \n"
