Then President Trump showed up.\n“Everyone stood up and clapped,” recalled Dershowitz, who lives in South Florida\nduring the Massachusetts winters.\nToward the end of the evening, Trump stopped by the table for an extended chat,\nbut not about the Trump-branded chocolate cake. The mogul-turned-president\nwanted to discuss the prospects for Israeli and Palestinian peace with Dershowitz,\nwho is well-known for his hawkish, pro-Israel views.\n“He pulled me aside,” Dershowitz recalled. “He wanted to talk to me privately\nabout the Middle East.”\nThe March 18 encounter provides a window into the free-wheeling and\nunconventional policy making employed by Trump, who prizes spontaneity. As a\nbusiness tycoon, he liked to keep an open schedule that allowed for impromptu\nmeetings; it’s a style difficult to replicate in the White House but can work among\nthe handpicked people who frequent Mar-a-Lago.\n2 of 8 4/7/2017 11:48 AM\nDershowitz details chat about Israel with president at his estate - The Bo... https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/04/06/dershowitz-detai...\nIn this instance, Dershowitz was a guest of Trump’s buddy and Mar-a-Lago\nComments\nmember Chris Ruddy, the CEO of the conservative news source Newsmax. The\nformer professor soon found himself immersed in a Washington power-player\nschmooze-fest. The mood at the club was light and fun. Vice President Mike Pence\nstopped over and complimented Dershowitz on his frequent cable TV appearances.\nCommerce Secretary Wilber Ross said “hi.’’ A singer crooned “Don’t Cry for Me\nArgentina.”\nWhen Trump came over, Dershowitz, a Democrat mostly known for his lefty views,\nshared his perspective on the National Security Agency, the fate of the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals, Trump’s travel limits on immigrants from majority-\nMuslim countries, and, most critically, peace between Israel and its Arab\nneighbors.\nThe Israeli paper Haaretz later reported that Trump asked Dershowitz to contact\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and convey the president’s belief\nthat peace could be achieved now. In his interview with the Globe, Dershowitz\nwouldn’t confirm or deny the account.\nThe atmosphere at Mar-a-Lago raises questions. Critics have pointed to Trump’s\nclub as an example of how access to the president can be purchased. The club\njacked up its initiation fee to $200,000 from $100,000 after Trump became\npresident. Members have a front row seat to history. Thursday night Chinese\nPresident Xi Jinping and his wife dined there as part of a summit with Trump. He\nalso feted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the club .\nFor Dershowitz, it helped greatly that he was at Mar-a-Lago as a guest of Ruddy.\nRuddy, it turned out, had seen Trump that day at the golf course and mentioned\nthat Dershowitz and his wife would be among the guests at his table of six.\nIn Ruddy’s re-telling, when Dershowitz’s name came up that afternoon on the links\nTrump offered praise for him because he’d gone on TV and defended Trump’s\ni i l b hi h i f i i i l h ll d i ll d i\nGet UNLIMITED access for only 99¢ per week.\n3 of 8 4/7/2017 11:48 AM\nDershowitz details chat about Israel with president at his estate - The Bo... https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/04/06/dershowitz-detai...\nDershowitz wouldn’t repeat what Trump told him privately but felt comfortable\nComments\nrecounting the parts of the their conversation that occurred in front of other dinner\nguests.\nTrump “clearly had subjects he wanted to talk about. It was his agenda,”\nDershowitz said. “He told me he thought in the Middle East, they are ready for a\ndeal.”\nTrump explained that he’d spoken to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and\nsensed that he was ready for a peace deal, Dershowitz said.\n“I responded by saying, ‘the Palestinians say that to every new president,’ ”\nDershowitz said, offering Trump a dose of skepticism.\n“He said ‘Now I think they’re really ready,’ ” Dershowitz added. “I said, ‘You have\nto test them. ... You have to test them, it’s not enough to just hear ‘they’re ready.’\n“He shook his head in apparent agreement,” Dershowitz said.\nDershowitz said Trump made it clear he was aware that the former professor is\n“very friendly” with Netanyahu.\nAnd the Israeli media is reporting that Dershowitz was tapped to be a back channel\nsorts between Netanyahu and Trump. This chatter prompted some to wonder\nwhether Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who’d been tasked to be the point\nperson on a possible peace deal, was on the outs.\nBut Dershowitz said that’s not the case. “The president said, ‘I know you know\nJared from Harvard. Be in touch with him.” ”\nAnd Dershowitz added that he doesn’t have a role, formal or informal, in working\non behalf of the administration to jump start peace talks. “This was as a one off,’’\nhe said.\nGet UNLIMITED access for only 99¢ per week.\n4 of 8 4/7/2017 11:48 AM\nDershowitz details chat about Israel with president at his estate - The Bo...\nMiddle East, ask me.’”\nComments\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/04/06/dershowitz-detai...\nAnnie Linskey can be reached at annie.linskey@globe.com.\nSHOW 13 COMMENTS\nStay updated, right in your news feed.\nLike 467K\nGet UNLIMITED access for only 99¢ per week.\nDershowitz details chat about Israel with president at his estate - The Bo...\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/04/06/dershowitz-detai...\n5 of 8 4/7/2017 11:48 AM\nComments\nBig-name, big-money coffee roasters are pouring into Boston and that’s made it\ntough to hire baristas and make a go of the old-fashioned coffee house.\nMORE...\nRussia pulled out of an agreement designed to use an exchange of information to\nminimize the risk of in-flight incidents in the skies above Syria.\nMORE...\nThe SoWa Open Market vs. South End Open Market feud is over, in part because\nmany people never knew there was a difference.\nMORE...\nA truck crashed into an upscale department store in central Stockholm on Friday,\nkilling at least two people.\nMORE...\nHateful acts are woven into the tapestry of everyday life, a new project\nfinds.\nMORE...\nRepresentative Seth Moulton has some choice words for President Donald Trump\nfollowing the US assault in Syria.\nMORE...\nGet UNLIMITED access for only 99¢ per week.\nDershowitz details chat about Israel with president at his estate - The Bo...\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/04/06/dershowitz-detai...\n6 of 8 4/7/2017 11:48 AM\nComments\ndo something about it.\nAs men grow older, they tend to let their friendships lapse.
