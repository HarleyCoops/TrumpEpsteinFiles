The company is offering $32 million for the property, \nwhich will set the floor price for a bankruptcy auction scheduled for next \nmonth. Bids at the auction will start at $32.5 million. \nThe 79-unit condo-hotel project on Palm Beach Island stalled in 2014 and \nits former developer now faces allegations of fraud by the Securities and \nExchange Commission and a group of EB-5 investors. In August, the \nproperty filed for bankruptcy under its court appointed receiver with \ncreditors claims totaling $115 million. \nCushman & Wakefield's Robert Given, Errol Blumer, Michael Mulkern and \nRobert Kaplan are the exclusive marketing advisers for the property. The \nauction is scheduled for 10 a.m. on November 16, 2018 in West Palm \nBeach. \nGiven said he expects the property to sell for up to $40 million and it could \nbe the last opportunity for a developer to own a hotel in the wealthy enclave \nof Palm Beach. He said the next owner will likely not redevelop the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027064 \nproperty. Instead, the best option would be to continue renovating the \nexisting project which could take more than a year to complete, Given said. \nBy auctioning the project through a bankruptcy sale, it will be offered free \nand clear from any liens. The bankruptcy also means that the new owner \nwill not have any responsibility for the issues stemming from EB-5 \ninvestors who had invested in the property. \nThe 82,648-square-foot project was first developed in 1961 and expanded in \n1981. The property was set to be renovated by a group led by developer \nRobert Matthews. \nMatthews then raised $44 million from EB-5 investors, according to a \ncomplaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission. EB-5 is a federal \nprogram that allows foreign investors the chance to gain a green card if they \ninvest at least $500,000 into certain projects that create at least 10 jobs. \nThe SEC's complaint said, however, that much of this money was \nmisallocated to pay for Matthews' personal expenses. Some of the funds \nallegedly went to pay for Mathews' Connecticut home, his 151-foot mega \nyacht, as well as to save his Palm Beach mansion from foreclosure, \naccording to the complaint. \nIn a separate lawsuit filed by a group of EB-5 investors, the development \ngroup claimed that famous celebrities and politicians such as Bill Clinton, \nDonald Trump, Celine Dion and Bill Koch — would serve on the Palm \nHouse's advisory board when, in fact, they did not. \nRelated Companies, led by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, \ndeveloped CityPlace West Palm Beach. The company is also proposing to \nbuild a 25-story office project called One Flagler in downtown West Palm \nBeach. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
