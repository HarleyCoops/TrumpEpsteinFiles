[jeevacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: hey hey \nAttachments: default.gif \nImportance: High \nTop of Form \nSearch ... \nBottom of Form \n'He doesn't like this sh*t': Trump \nreportedly hates his job and his staff after \nless than a month \nTRAVIS GETTYS \n10 FEB 2017 AT 08:38 ET \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030868 \nDonald Trump (screen capture) \nDON'T MISS STORIES. FOLLOW RAW STORY! \nAfter just three weeks on the job, President Donald Trump is reportedly frustrated with the realities of trying to \nrun the U.S. government the way he manages his family-owned business. \nPolitico interviewed nearly two dozen people who have spent time with the former real estate developer and \nreality TV star since his inauguration — and they said Trump's \"mood has careened between surprise and anger \nas he's faced the predictable realities of governing,\" according to the report. \n\"The interviews paint a picture of a powder-keg of a workplace where job duties are unclear, morale among \nsome is low, factionalism is rampant and exhaustion is running high,\" Politico reported. \"Two visitors to the \nWhite House last week said they were struck by how tired the staff looks.\" \nTrump would like to shake up his White House staff less than a month into the job but knows it's too soon, the \nwebsite reported, and aides joke that the president would like to spend even more time golfing at his Mar-A-\nLago resort. \nSources close to Trump said he's infuriated by the profusion of leaks revealing his confrontational phone calls \nwith world leaders and the herky-jerky inner workings of the White House. \nThe White House has launched an investigation of those leaks that appears to be focused on the National \nSecurity Council, based on the Politico report. \nNSC staffers have been instructed to cooperate with the inquiry, and the administration may tighten the inner \ncircle of aides who have access to the calls and their transcripts, the website reported. \nA culture of fear and paranoia is developing, pitting the president and his allies against career NSC staff \nassigned from other agencies. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030869 \nThe Trump circle believe those career bureaucrats are out to get them, while NSC staffers are concerned the \npresident isn't up to the job and resent the politicization of the agency by appointing Bannon to the council. \nStaffers fear Kushner because he's so close to the president, and they aren't really sure of his official role in the \nWhite House. \nFor his part, Kushner is furious at reports that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has been saying he will join the \nWhite House as part of a \"second wave\" after the president's son-in-law got him banished from the transition \nteam as retribution for prosecuting his father. \nSources said Trump often asks simple questions about his job, and he usually changes the subject when \ndiscussions become too detail-oriented to make it seem as if he's in control, said one senior government official. \nTrump prefers to hand off detailed questions to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, or to chief strategist Steve \nBannon or House Speaker Paul Ryan, the website reported. \nThose sources also revealed that Trump has privately expressed disbelief that judges, bureaucrats and \nlawmakers are able to halt him from filling government positions or implementing policies. \n\"He doesn't like this sh*t,\" a source told Politico, referring to the difficulties Trump faced in getting one of his \ntop fundraisers, Anthony Scaramucci, appointed to a job in the West Wing. \nHowever, sources said Trump appears to enjoy showing visitors around the Oval Office, where he spends most \nof his working hours, and keeping tabs on how his staffers look on TV news. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030870 \n"
