THE WALL 295 \nEPILOGUE: THE REPORT 309 \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS 317 \nINDEX 319 \nAuthor's Note \nShortly after Donald Trump's inauguration as the forty-fifth president of \nthe United States, I was allowed into the West Wing as a sideline observer. \nMy book Fire and Fury was the resulting account of the organizational \nchaos and constant drama—more psychodrama than political drama—of \nTrump's first seven months in office. Here was a volatile and uncertain \npresident, releasing, almost on a daily basis, his strange furies on the world, \nand, at the same time, on his own staff. This first phase of the most abnor-\nmal White House in American history ended in August 2017, with the \ndeparture of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and the appointment of \nretired general John Kelly as chief of staff \nThis new account begins in February 2018 at the outset of Trump's \nsecond year in office, with the situation now profoundly altered. The pres-\nident's capricious furies have been met by an increasingly organized and \nmethodical institutional response. The wheels of justice are inexorably \nturning against him. In many ways, his own government, even his own \nWhite House, has begun to turn on him. Virtually every power center left \nof the far-right wing has deemed him unfit. Even some among his own \nbase find him undependable, hopelessly distracted, and in over his head. \nNever before has a president been under such concerted attack with such \na limited capacity to defend himself. \nHis enemies surround him, dedicated to bringing him down. \n\fXII \nAUTHOR'S NOTE \nAUTHOR'S NOTE \nXI!! \n* * * \nI am joined in my train-wreck fascination with Trump—that certain \nknowledge that in the end he will destroy himself—by, I believe, almost \neveryone who has encountered him since he was elected president. \nTo have worked anywhere near him is to be confronted with the most \nextreme and disorienting behavior possible. That is hardly an overstate-\nment. Not only is Trump not like other presidents, he is not like anyone \nmost of us have ever known. Hence, everyone who has been close to him \nfeels compelled to try to explain him and to dine out on his head-smacking \npeculiarities. It is yet one more of his handicaps: all the people around \nhim, however much they are bound by promises of confidentiality or \nnondisclosure agreements or even friendship, cannot stop talking about \ntheir experience with him. In this sense, he is more exposed than any \npresident in history. \nMany of the people in the White House who helped me during the \nwriting of Fire and Fury are now outside of the administration, yet they are \nas engaged as ever by the Trump saga. I am grateful to be part of this sub-\nstantial network. Many of Trump's pre-White House cronies continue to \nboth listen to him and support him; at the same time, as an expression both \nof their concern and of their incredulity, they report among one another, \nand to others as well, on his temper, mood, and impulses. In general, I \nhave found that the closer people are to him, the more alarmed they have \nfound themselves at various points about his mental state. They all spec-\nulate about how this will end—badly for him, they almost all conclude. \nIndeed, Trump is probably a much better subject for writers interested in \nhuman capacities and failings than for most of the reporters and writers \nwho regularly cover Washington and who are primarily interested in the \npursuit of success and power. \nMy primary goal in Siege is to create a readable and intuitive narrative—\nthat is its nature. Another goal is to write the near equivalent of a real-time \nhistory of this extraordinary moment, since understanding it well after \nthe fact might be too late. A final goal is pure portraiture: Donald Trump \nas an extreme, almost hallucinatory, and certainly cautionary, Amer-\nican character. To accomplish this, to gain the perspective and to find \nthe voices necessary to tell the larger story, I provided anonymity to any \nsource who requested it. In cases where I have been told—on the prom-\nise of no attribution—about an unreported event or private conversation \nor remark, I have made every effort to confirm it with other sources or \ndocuments. In some cases, I have witnessed the events or conversations \ndescribed herein. With regard to the Mueller investigation, the narrative \nI provide is based on internal documents given to me by sources close to \nthe Office of the Special Counsel. \nDealing with sources in the Trump White House has continued to \noffer its own set of unique issues. A basic requirement of working there \nis, surely, the willingness to infinitely rationalize or delegitimize the truth, \nand, when necessary, to outright lie. In fact, I believe this has caused some \nof the same people who have undermined the public trust to become pri-\nvate truth-tellers. This is their devil's bargain. But for the writer, interview-\ning such Janus-faced sources creates a dilemma, for it requires depending \non people who lie to also tell the truth—and who might later disavow the \ntruth they have told. Indeed, the extraordinary nature of much of what \nhas happened in the Trump White House is often baldly denied by its \nspokespeople, as well as by the president himself. Yet in each successive \naccount of this administration, the level of its preposterousness—even as \nthat bar has been consistently raised—has almost invariably been con-\nfirmed. \nIn an atmosphere that promotes, and frequently demands, hyperbole, \ntone itself becomes a key part of accuracy. For instance, most crucially, \nthe president, by a wide range of the people in close contact with him, is \noften described in maximal terms of mental instability. \"I have never met \nanyone crazier than Donald Trump\" is the wording of one staff member \nwho has spent almost countless hours with the president. Something like \nthis has been expressed to me by a dozen others with firsthand experience. \nHow do you translate that into a responsible evaluation of this singular \nWhite House? My strategy is to try to show and not tell, to describe the \nbroadest context, to communicate the experience, to make it real enough \nfor a reader to evaluate for him- or herself where Donald Trump falls on a \nvertiginous sliding scale of human behavior. It is that condition, an emo-\ntional state rather than a political state, that is at the heart of this book. \n\f1 \nBULLSEYE \nThe president made his familiar stink-in-the-room face, then way \nhis hands as though to ward off a bug. \n\"Don't tell me this,\" he said. \"Why are you telling me this?\" \nHis personal lawyer John Dowd, in late February 2018, little mo \nthan a year into Trump's tenure, was trying to explain that prosecutc \nwere likely to issue a subpoena for some of the Trump Organizatio: \nbusiness records. \nTrump seemed to respond less to the implications of such a deep di \ninto his affairs than to having to hear about it at all. His annoyance set ( \na small rant. It was not so much about people out to get him—and pe \npie were surely out to get him—but that nobody was defending him. T \nproblem was his own people. Especially his lawyers. \nTrump wanted his lawyers to \"fix\" things. \"Don't bring me problen \nbring me solutions:' was a favorite CEO bromide that he often repeat€ \nHe judged his lawyers by their under-the-table or sleight-of-hand ski \nand held them accountable when they could not make problems disa \npear. His problems became their fault. \"Make it go away\" was one of I-\nfrequent orders. It was often said in triplicate: \"Make it go away, make \ngo away, make it go away.\" \nThe White House counsel Don McGahn—representing the Whi \n\f2 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE \nHouse rather than, in a distinction Trump could never firmly grasp, the \npresident himself—demonstrated little ability to make problems disap-\npear and became a constant brunt of Trump's rages and invective. His legal \ninterpretation of proper executive branch function too often thwarted his \nboss's wishes. \nDowd and his colleagues, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow—the trio of law-\nyers charged with navigating the president through his personal legal \nproblems—had, on the other hand, become highly skilled in avoiding \ntheir client's bad humor, which was often accompanied by menacing, \nbarely controlled personal attacks. All three men understood that to-be a \nsuccessful lawyer for Donald Trump was to tell the client what he wanted \nto hear. \nTrump harbored a myth about the ideal lawyer that had almost noth-\ning to do with the practice of law. He invariably cited Roy Cohn, his old \nNew York friend, attorney, and tough-guy mentor, and Robert Kennedy, \nJohn F. Kennedy's brother. \"He was always on my ass about Roy Cohn \nand Bobby Kennedy,\" said Steve Bannon, the political strategist who, \nperhaps more than anyone else, was responsible for Trump's victory. \n\"'Roy Cohn and Bobby Kennedy,' he would say. 'Where's my Roy Cohn \nand Bobby Kennedy?\" Cohn, to his own benefit and legend, built the \nmyth that Trump continued to embrace: with enough juice and mus-\ncle, the legal system could always be gamed. Bobby Kennedy had been \nhis brother's attorney general and hatchet man; he protected JFK and \nworked the back channels of power for the benefit of the family. \nThis was the constant Trump theme: beating the system. \"I'm the guy \nwho gets away with it:' he had often bragged to friends in New York. \nAt the same time, he did not want to know details. He merely wanted \nhis lawyers to assure him that he was winning. \"We're killing it, right? \nThat's what I want to know. That's all I want to know. If we're not killing \nit, you screwed up,\" he shouted one afternoon at members of his ad hoc \nlegal staff. \nFrom the start, it had become a particular challenge to find top law-\nyers to take on what, in the past, had always been one of the most vaunted \nof legal assignments: representing the president of the United States. One \nhigh-profile Washington white-collar litigator gave Trump a list of twenty \nissues that would immediately need to be addressed if he were to ta \non the case. Trump refused to consider any of them. More than a doz \nmajor firms had turned down his business. In the end, Trump was left wi \na ragtag group of solo practitioners without the heft and resources oft \nfirms. Now, thirteen months after his inauguration, he was facing p( \nsonal legal trouble at least as great as that faced by Richard Nixon and I \nClinton, and doing so with what seemed like, at best, a Court Street lei \nteam. But Trump appeared to be oblivious to this exposed flank. Ratchi \ning up his level of denial about the legal threats around him, he breez \nrationalized: \"If I had good lawyers, I'd look guilty\" \nDowd, at seventy-seven, had had a long, successful legal career, bc \nin government and in Washington law firms. But that was in the past. \nwas on his own now, eager to postpone retirement. He knew the imp( \ntance, certainly to his own position in Trump's legal circle, of und( \nstanding his client's needs. He was forced to agree with the presider \nassessment of the investigation into his campaign's contact with Russi \nstate interests: it would not reach him. To that end, Dowd, and the otk \nmembers of Trump's legal team, recommended that the president coo \nerate with the Mueller investigation. \n\"I'm not a target, right?\" Trump constantly prodded them. \nThis wasn't a rhetorical question. He insisted on an answer, and \naffirmative one: \"Mr. President, you're not a target:' Early in his tenu \nTrump had pushed FBI director James Comey to provide precisely ti \nreassurance. In one of the signature moves of his presidency, he had fir \nComey in May 2017 in part because he wasn't satisfied with the enth \nsiasm of the affirmation and therefore assumed Comey was plotti \nagainst him. \nWhether the president was indeed a target—and it would surely ha \ntaken a through-the-looking-glass exercise not to see him as the bulls€ \nof the Mueller investigation—seemed to occupy a separate reality fn \nTrump's need to be reassured that he was not a target. \n\"Trump's trained me:' Ty Cobb told Steve Bannon. \"Even if it's tx \nit's great:' \nTrump imagined—indeed, with a preternatural confidence, nothi \nappeared to dissuade him—that sometime in the very near future he ww. \n\f4 \nMICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE \nhear directly from the special counsel, who would send him a compre-\nhensive and even apologetic letter of exoneration. \n\"Where,\" he kept demanding to know, \"is my fucking letter?\" \n* * * \nThe grand jury empanelled by Special Counsel Robert Mueller met on \nThursdays and Fridays in federal district court in Washington. Its busi-\nness was conducted on the fifth floor of an unremarkable building at 333 \nConstitution Avenue. The grand jurors gathered in a nondescript space \nthat looked less like a courtroom than a classroom, with prosecutors at a \npodium and witnesses sitting at a desk in the front of the room. The Mueller \ngrand jurors were more female than male, more white than black, older \nrather than younger; they were distinguished most of all by their focus \nand intensity. They listened to the proceedings with \"a scary sort of atten-\ntion, as though they already know everything,\" said one witness. \nIn a grand jury inquiry, you fall into one of three categories. You are \na \"witness of fact:' meaning the prosecutor believes you have information \nabout an investigation at hand. Or you are a \"subject:' meaning you are \nregarded as having personal involvement with the crime under investiga-\ntion. Or, most worrisome, you are a \"target:' meaning the prosecutor is \nseeking to have the grand jury indict you. Witnesses often became sub-\njects, and subjects often became targets. \nIn early 2018, with the Mueller investigation and its grand jury main-\ntaining a historic level of secrecy, no one in the White House could be sure \nwho was what. Or who was saying what to whom. Anyone and everyone \nworking for the president or one of his senior aides could be talking to the \nspecial counsel. The investigation's code of silence extended into the West \nWing. Nobody knew, and nobody was saying, who was spilling the beans. \nAlmost every White House senior staffer—the collection of advisers \nwho had firsthand dealings with the president—had retained a lawyer. \nIndeed, from the president's first days in the White House, Trump's tangled \nlegal past and evident lack of legal concern had cast a shadow on those \nwho worked for him. Senior people were looking for lawyers even as they \nwere still learning how to navigate the rabbit warren that is the West Wing. \nIn February 2017, mere weeks after the inauguration, and not long \nafter the FBI had first raised questions about National Security AdN \nMichael Flynn, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had walked into Steve I \nnon's office and said, \"I'm going to do you a big favor. Give me your ci \ncard. Don't ask me why, just give it to me. You'll be thanking me fol \nrest of your life:' \nBannon opened his wallet and gave Priebus his American Exr \ncard. Priebus shortly returned, handed the card back, and said, \"You \nhave legal insurance' \nOver the next year, Bannon—a witness of fact—spent hundrec \nhours with his lawyers preparing for his testimony before the spi \ncounsel and before Congress. His lawyers in turn spent ever moun \nhours talking to Mueller's team and to congressional committee coun \nBannon's legal costs at the end of the year came to $2 million. \nEvery lawyer's first piece of advice to his or her client was blunt \nunequivocal: talk to no one, lest it become necessary to testify aboutI \nyou said. Before long, a constant preoccupation of senior staffers in \nTrump White House was to know as little as possible. It was a wr( \nside-up world: where being \"in the room\" was traditionally the \nsought-after status, now you wanted to stay out of meetings. You wa: \nto avoid being a witness to conversations; you wanted to avoid b \nwitnessed being a witness to conversations, at least if you were sn \nCertainly, nobody was your friend. It was impossible to know wilt \ncolleague stood in the investigation; hence, you had no way of knoN \nhow likely it was that they might need to offer testimony about som( \nelse—you, perhaps—as the bargaining chip to save themselves by a \nerating with the special counsel, a.k.a. flipping. \nThe White House, it rapidly dawned on almost everyone who wol \nthere—even as it became one more reason not to work there—was \nscene of an ongoing criminal investigation, one that could potent \nensnare anyone who was anywhere near it. \n* * * \nThe ultimate keeper of the secrets from the campaign, the transition, \nthrough the first year in the White House was Hope Hicks, the AN \nHouse communications director. She had witnessed most everyth \n\f6 MICHAEL WOLFF SIEGE 7 \nShe saw what the president saw: she knew what the president, a man \nunable to control his own running monologue, knew. \nOn February 27, 2018, testifying before the House Intelligence \nCommittee—she had already appeared before the special counsel—she \nwas pressed about whether she had ever lied for the president. Perhaps a \nmore accomplished communications professional could have escaped the \ncorner here, but Hicks, who had scant experience other than working as \nDonald Trump's spokesperson, which, as often as not, meant dealing with \nhis disregard of empirical truth, found herself as though in a sudden and \nunexpected moral void trying to publicly parse the relative importance \nof her boss's lies. She admitted to telling \"white lies:' as in, somehow, less \nthan the biggest lies. This was enough of a forward admission to require \na nearly twenty-minute mid-testimony conference with her lawyers, dis-\ntressed by what she might be admitting and by where any deconstruction \nof the president's constant inversions might lead. \nNot long after she testified, another witness before the Mueller grand \njury was asked how far Hicks might go to lie for the president. The witness \nanswered: \"I think when it comes to doing anything as a 'yes man' for \nTrump, she'll do it—but she won't take a bullet for him?' The statement \ncould be taken as both a backhanded compliment and an estimate of how \nfar loyalty in the Trump White House might extend—probably not too far. \nAlmost no one in Trump's administration, it could be argued, was con-\nventionally suited to his or her job. But with the possible exception of the \npresident himself, no one provided a better illustration of this unprepared \nand uninformed presidency than Hicks. She did not have substantial media \nor political experience, nor did she have a temperament annealed by years \nof high-pressure work. Always dressed in the short skirts that Trump \nfavored, she seemed invariably caught in the headlights. Trump admired \nher not because she had the political skills to protect him, but for her pliant \ndutifulness. Her job was to devote herself to his care and feeding. \n\"When you speak to him, open with positive feedback:' counseled \nHicks, understanding Trump's need for constant affirmation and his \nalmost complete inability to talk about anything but himself. Her atten-\ntiveness to Trump and tractable nature had elevated her, at age twenty-nine, \nto the top White House communications job. And practically speaking, \nshe acted as his de facto chief of staff. Trump did not want his administra-\ntion to be staffed by professionals; he wanted it to be staffed by people who \nattended and catered to him. \nHicks—\"Hope-y,\" to Trump—was both the president's gatekeeper \nand his comfort blanket. She was also a frequent subject of his pruri-\nent interest: Trump preferred business, even in the White House, to be \npersonal. \"Who's fucking Hope?\" he would demand to know. The topic \nalso interested his son Don Jr., who often professed his intention to \"fuck \nHope The president's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, \nboth White House senior advisers, expressed a gentler type of concern for \nHicks; sometimes they would even try to suggest eligible men. \nBut Hicks, seeming to understand the insular nature of Trumpworld, \ndated exclusively inside the bubble, picking the baddest boys in it: cam-\npaign manager Corey Lewandowslci during the campaign and presiden-\ntial aide Rob Porter in the White House. As the relationship between \nHicks and Porter unfolded in the fall of 2017, knowing about the affair \nbecame an emblem of Trump insiderness, with special care taken to keep \nthis development from the proprietary president. Or not: other people, \nassuming that Porter's involvement with Hicks would not at all please \nTrump, were less than discreet about it. \n* * * \nIn the heightened enmity of the Trump White House, Rob Porter may have \nsucceeded in becoming the most disliked person by everyone except per-\nhaps the president himself A square-jawed, 1950s-looking guy who could \nhave been a model for Brylcreem, he was almost a laughable figure of \nbetrayal and perfidy: if he hadn't stabbed you in the back, you would be \nforced to acknowledge how unworthy he considered you to be. A sitcom \nsort of suck-up—\"Eddie Haskell,\" cracked Bannon, citing the early televi-\nsion icon of insincerity and brownnosing featured in Leave It to Beaver—he \nembraced Chief of Staff John Kelly, while at the same time poisoning him \nwith the president. Porter's estimation of his own high responsibilities in \nthe White House, together with the senior-most jobs that the president, \nhe let it be known, was promising him, seemed to put the administration \nand the nation squarely on his shoulders. \n\f8 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE \nPorter had, before the age of forty, two bitter ex-wives, at least one \nof whom he had beaten, and both of whom he had cheated on at talk-\nof-the-town levels. During a stint as a Senate staffer, the married Porter \nhad an affair with an intern, costing him his job. His girlfriend Samantha \nDravis had moved in with Porter in the summer of 2017, while, quite \nunbeknownst to her, he was seeing Hicks. \"I cheated on you because you're \nnot attractive enough:' he later told Dravis. \nIn a potentially criminal break of protocol, Porter had gained access \nto his raw FBI clearance reports and seen the statements of his ex-wives. \nHis most recent ex-wife had also written a blog about his alleged abuse, \nwhich, while it did not name him, clearly fingered him. Concerned about \nthe damaging impact his former wives could have on his security review, \nhe recruited Dravis to help him smooth his relationship with both women. \nLewandowski, Hicks's former boyfriend, caught wind of the Hicks-\nPorter relationship and began working to expose it; by some reports, \nhe got paparazzi to follow Hicks. Though Porter's history of abuse was \nslowly making its way to the surface as a result of the FBI investigation, \nthe Lewandowski campaign against Hicks cut through many other efforts \nto cover up Porter's transgressions. \nDravis, in the autumn of 2017, heard the Lewandowski-pushed \nrumors of the Hicks-Porter relationship. After finding Hicks's number \nlisted under a man's name in Porter's contacts, Dravis confronted Porter, \nwho promptly threw her out. Moving back in with her parents, she began \nher own revenge campaign, openly talking about Porter's security clear-\nance issues, including to people inside the White House counsel's office, \nsaying he had protection at the highest levels in the White House. Then, \nalong with Lewandowski, Dravis helped leak the details of the Hicks-\nPorter romance to the Daily Mail, which published a story about it on \nFebruary 1. \nBut Dravis, joined by Porter's former wives, decided that, outra-\ngeously, he had come out looking good in the Daily Mail account—he \nwas part of a glam power couple! Porter called Dravis to taunt her: \"You \nthought you could get me!\" Dravis and his former wives all then publicly \nrevealed their abuse at his hand. His first wife said he kicked and punched \nher; she even produced a photograph of her black eye. His second wife \ninformed the media that she had filed an emergency protective orC \nagainst him. \nThe White House, or at least Kelly—and likely Hicks—had been am \nof many of these claims and, effectively, covered them up. (\"You usua \nhave enough competent people for White House positions to weed out \nwife beaters, but you couldn't be so choosy in the Trump White House,\" \none Republican acquaintance of Porter's.) The furor that erupted arou \nPorter and his troubling gross-guy history not only annoyed Trump \n\"He stinks of bad press\"—it further weakened Kelly. On February 7, af \nboth of his former wives gave interviews to CNN, Porter resigned. \nA publicity-shy Hicks—Donald Trump put a high value on associa \nwho did not steal his press opportunities—suddenly found her love 1 \nin the glare of intense international press scrutiny. Her affair with the d \ncredited Porter highlighted her own odd relationship with the presid( \nand his family, as well as the haphazard management, interpersonal •:1 \nfunctions, and general lack of political savvy in the Trump court. \n* * * \nThe affair was, curiously, among the least of Hicks's problems. Indeed, i \nHicks the Porter scandal became perhaps a better cloud under which \nleave the administration than what almost everybody in the West Wi \nassumed was the real cloud. \nOn February 27, a reporter at the Washington insider newsletter Axi \nJonathan Swan, a favorite conduit for White House leaks, reported ti \nJosh Raffel was leaving the White House. In a novel arrangement, Rai \nhad come into the White House in April 2017 as the exclusive spokespers \nfor the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his wife, Ivanka, bypa \ning the White House communications team. Raffel, who, like Kushn \nwas a Democrat, had worked for Hiltzik Strategies, the New York pub \nrelations firm that represented Ivanka's clothing line. \nHope Hicks, who had also worked for the Hiltzik firm—perhaps 1), \nknown for having long represented the film producer Harvey Weinste \ncaught, in the fall of 2017, in an epochal harassment and abuse scan( \nand cover-up—had originally had the same role as Raffel but at a hie \nlevel: she was the personal spokesperson for the president. In Septemb \n\f10 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE \nHicks had been elevated to White House communications director, with \nRaffel as her number two. \nThe trouble had arisen the previous summer. Both Hicks and Raffel \nhad been on Air Force One in July 2017 as the news broke about Donald \nTrump Jr.'s meeting in Trump Tower during the campaign with Russian \ngovernment go-betweens offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. During the \nflight back to the United States after the G20 summit in Germany, Hicks \nand Raffel aided the president in his efforts to issue a largely false story \nabout the Trump Tower meeting, thus becoming part of the cover-up. \nEven though Raffel had been at the White House for a little more than \nnine months, the Axios report said that his departure had been under dis-\ncussion for several months. That was untrue. It was an abrupt exit. \nThe next day, just as abruptly, Hope Hicks—the person in the White \nHouse closest to the president—resigned as well. \nThe one person who perhaps knew more than anyone else about the \nworkings of the Trump campaign and the Trump White House was sud-\ndenly out the door. The profound concern inside the White House was \nthe reasonable supposition that Hicks and Raffel, both witnesses to and \nparticipants in the president's efforts to cover up the details of his son and \nson-in-law's meeting with the Russians, were subjects or targets of the \nMueller investigation—or, worse, had already cut a deal. \nThe president, effusive in his public praise for Hicks, did not try to \ntalk her out of leaving. In the weeks to come he would mope about her \nabsence—\"Where's my Hope-y?\"—but, in fact, as soon as he got wind \nthat she might be talking, he wanted to cut her loose and began, in a \nsignificant rewrite, downgrading her status and importance on the cam-\npaign and in the White House. \nYet here, from Trump's point of view, was a hopeful point about Hicks: \nas central as she was to his presidency, her duties really only consisted of \npleasing him. She was an unlikely agent of grand strategy and great con-\nspiracies. Trump's team was made up of only bit players. \n* * * \nJohn Dowd may have been reluctant to give his client bad news, but \nhe well understood the danger of a thorough prosecutor with virtually \nunlimited resources. The more a determined team of G-men sifts, strir \nand inspects, the greater the chance that both methodical and cast \ncrimes will be revealed. The more comprehensive the search, the mc \ninevitable the outcome. The case of Donald Trump—with his history \nbankruptcies, financial legerdemain, dubious associations, and gene] \nsense of impunity—certainly seemed to offer prosecutors something \nan embarrassment of riches. \nFor his part, however, Donald Trump yet seemed to believe that I \nskills and instincts were at least a match for all the thoroughness a] \nresources of the United States Department of Justice. He even believ \ntheir exhaustive approach would work in his favor. \"Boring. Confusi \nfor everybody:' he said, dismissing the reports of the investigation pi \nvided by Dowd and others. \"You can't follow any of this. No hook:' \nOne of the many odd aspects of Trump's presidency was that \ndid not see being president, either the responsibilities or the exposu \nas being all that different from his pre-presidential life. He had endur \nalmost countless investigations in his long career. He had been involv \nin various kinds of litigation for the better part of forty-five years. He \na fighter who, with brazenness and aggression, got out of fixes that wot \nhave ruined a weaker, less wily player. That was his essential busint \nstrategy: what doesn't kill me strengthens me. Though he was wound \nagain and again, he never bled out. \n\"It's playing the game,\" he explained in one of his frequent mor \nlogues about his own superiority and everyone else's stupidity. \"I'm go \nat the game. Maybe I'm the best. Really, I could be the best. I think I \nthe best. I'm very good. Very cool. Most people are afraid that the wo \nmight happen. But it doesn't, unless you're stupid. And I'm not stupid: \nIn the weeks after his first anniversary in office, with the Mudl \ninvestigation in its eighth month, Trump continued to regard the si \ncial counsel's inquiry as a contest of wills. He did not see it as a war \nattrition—a gradual reduction of the strength and credibility of the t \nget through sustained scrutiny and increasing pressure. Instead, he saN \nsituation to confront, a spurious government undertaking that was v \nnerable to his attacks. He was confident he could jawbone this \"wii \nhunt\"—often tweeted in all-caps—to at least a partisan draw. \n\f12 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE 12 \nHe remained irritated by efforts to persuade him to play the game in \nthe usual Washington way—mounting a disciplined legal defense, negoti-\nating, trying to cut his losses—rather than his way. This was disconcerting \nto many of the people closest to him, but it alarmed them more to see that \nas Trump's indignation and sense of personal insult rose, so did his belief \nin his own innocence. \n* * * \nBy the end of February, in addition to the Mueller grand jury indictments \nof a group of Russian nationals for illegal activities involved with efforts \nby the Russian government to influence the U.S. election, Mueller had \nreached several levels into the Trump circle. Among those who were \nindicted or who had pled guilty to felonies were his former campaign man-\nager Paul Manafort, his former national security advisor Michael Flynn, \nthe eager-beaver junior adviser George Papadopoulos, and Manafort's \nbusiness partner and campaign official Rick Gates. This series of legal \nmoves could be classically read as a methodical, step-by-step approach to \nthe president's door. Or, from the Trump camp's point of view, it could be \nseen as a roundup of the sorts of opportunists and hangers-on who had \nalways trailed Trump. \nThe doubts about the usefulness of Trump's hangers-on was an implicit \npart of their usefulness: they could be shrugged off and disavowed at any \ntime, which is what promptly happened at the least sign of trouble. The \nTrumpers swept up by Mueller were all declared wannabe and marginal \nplayers. The president had never met them, could not remember them, or \nhad a limited acquaintance with them. \"I know Mr. Manafort—I haven't \nspoken to him in a long time, but I know him:' declared a dismissive \nTrump, pulling a line from the \"who dat?\" page of his playbook. \nThe difficulty in proving a conspiracy is proving intent. Many of the \npresident's inner circle believed that Trump, and the Trump Organiza-\ntion, and by extension the Trump campaign, operated in such a diffuse, \nhaphazard, gang-that-couldn't-shoot-straight manner that intent would \nbe very difficult to establish. What's more, the Trump hangers-on were \nso demonstrably subpar players that stupidity could well be a reasonable \ndefense against intent. \nMany in the Trump circle agreed with their boss: they believed tha \nwhatever idiotic moves had been made by idiotic Trump hands, the Rus. \nsia investigation was too abstruse and nickel-and-dime to ultimately stick \nAt the same time, many, and perhaps all, were privately convinced tha \na deep dive—or, for that matter, even a cursory inspection—of Trump' \nfinancial past would yield a trove of overt offenses, and likely a pattern o \ncareer corruption. \nIt was hardly surprising, then, that ever since the beginning of th \nspecial counsel's investigation, Trump had tried to draw a line in the sani \nbetween Mueller and Trump family finances, openly threatening Muelle \nif he went there. Trump's operating assumption remained that the speck \ncounsel was afraid of him, conscious of where and how his toleranc \nmight end. Trump was confident that the Mueller team could be made t \nunderstand its limits, by either wink-wink or unsubtle threat. \n\"They know they can't get me,\" he told one member of his circl \nof after-dinner callers, \"because I was never involved. I'm not a targe \nThere's nothing. I'm not a target. They've told me, I'm not a target. An \nthey know what would happen if they made me a target. Everybod \nunderstands everybody:' \n* * * \nBooks and newspaper stories about Trump's forty-five years in busine; \nwere full of his shady dealings, and his arrival in the White House on: \nhelped to highlight them and surface even juicier ones. Real estate 3,4g \nthe world's favorite money-laundering currency, and Trump's B-level re \nestate business—relentlessly marketed by Trump as triple A—was qui \nexplicitly designed to appeal to money launderers. What's more, Trumi \nown financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain his billionaire lif \nstyle, cachet, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubt \nschemes. In the high irony department, Jared Kushner, when he was: \nlaw school, and before he met Ivanka, identified, in a paper he wrot \npossible claims of fraud against the Trump Organization in a particul \nreal estate deal he was studying—a subject now of quite some amuseme \namong his acquaintances at the time. Practically speaking, Trump hid \nplain sight, as the prosecutors appeared to be finding. \n\f14 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE 15 \nIn November 2004, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein, the financier later \ncaught in a scandal involving underage prostitutes, agreed to purchase \nfrom bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach, Florida, for $36 million, a prop-\nerty that had been on the market for two years. Epstein and Trump had \nbeen close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade, \nwith Trump often seeking Epstein's help with his chaotic financial affairs. \nSoon after negotiating the deal for the house in Palm Beach, Epstein took \nTrump to see it, looking for advice on construction issues involved with \nmoving the swimming pool. But as he prepared to finalize his purchase \nfor the house, Epstein discovered that Trump, who was severely cash-\nconstrained at the time, had bid $41 million for the property and bought \nit out from under Epstein through an entity called Trump Properties \nLLC, entirely financed by Deutsche Bank, which was already carrying a \nsubstantial number of troubled loans to the Trump Organization and to \nTrump personally. \nTrump, Epstein knew, had been loaning out his name in real estate \ndeals—that is, for an ample fee, Trump would serve as a front man to \ndisguise the actual ownership in a real estate transaction. (This was, in \na sense, another variation of Trump's basic business model of licensing \nhis name for commercial properties owned by someone else.) A furi-\nous Epstein, certain that Trump was merely fronting for the real owners, \nthreatened to expose the deal, which was getting extensive coverage in \nFlorida papers. The fight became all the more bitter when, not long after \nthe purchase, Trump put the house on the market for $125 million. \nBut if Epstein knew some of Trump's secrets, Trump knew some of \nEpstein's. Trump often saw the financier at Epstein's current Palm Beach \nhouse, and Trump knew that Epstein was visited almost every day, and \nhad been for many years, by girls he'd hired to give him massages that \noften had happy endings—girls recruited from local restaurants, strip clubs, \nand, also, Trump's own Mar-a-Lago. Just as the enmity between the two \nfriends increased over the house purchase, Epstein found himself under \ninvestigation by the Palm Beach police. And as Epstein's legal prob-\nlems escalated, the house, with only minor improvements, was acquired \nfor $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev, an oligarch who was part of the \nclose Putin circle of government-aligned industrialists in Russia, and who, \nin fact, never moved into the house. Trump had, miraculously, earned \n$55 million without putting up a dime. Or, more likely, Trump merely \nearned a fee for hiding the real owner—a shadow owner quite possibly \nbeing funneled cash by Rybolovlev for other reasons beyond the value \nof the house. Or, possibly, the real owner and real buyer were one and \nthe same. Rybolovlev might have, in effect, paid himself for the house, \nthereby cleansing the additional $55 million for the second purchase \nof the house. \nThis was Donald Trump's world of real estate. \n* * * \nAs though using mind-control tricks, Jared Kushner had become highly \nskilled at containing his deep frustration with his father-in-law. He stayed \nexpressionless—sometimes he seemed almost immobile—when Trump \nwent off the rails, unleashing tantrums or proposing dopey political or \npolicy moves. Kushner, a courtier in a crazy court, was possessed of an \neerie calmness and composure. He was also very worried. It seemed \nastounding and ludicrous that this fig-leaf technicality—\"You're not a \ntarget, Mr. President\"—could offer his father-in-law such comfort. \nKushner understood that Trump was surrounded by a set of mortal \narrows, any of which might kill him: the case for obstruction; the case \nfor collusion; any close look at his long, dubious financial history; the \nalways-lurking issues with women; the prospects of a midterm rout and \nthe impeachment threat if the midterm elections went against them; the \nfickleness of the Republicans, who might at any time turn on him; and the \nsenior staffers who had been pushed out of the administration (Kushner \nhad urged the ouster of many of them), any of whom might testify against \nhim. In March alone, Gary Cohn, the president's chief economic adviser, \nRex Tillerson, the secretary of state, and Andrew McCabe, the deputy \ndirector of the FBI—each man bearing the president deep contempt—\nwere pushed from the administration. \nBut the president was in no mood to hear Kushner's counsel. Never \nentirely trusted by his father-in-law—in truth, Trump trusted no one \nexcept, arguably, his daughter Ivanka, Kushner's wife—Kushner now found \nhimself decidedly on the wrong side of Trump's red line of loyalty. \n\f16 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE \nAs a family insider, Kushner, in a game of court politics so vicious \nthat, in another time, it might have yielded murder plots, had appeared to \ntriumph over his early White House rivals. But Trump invariably soured \non the people who worked for him, just as they soured on him, not least \nbecause he nearly always came to believe that his staff was profiting at his \nexpense. He was convinced that everyone was greedy, and that sooner or \nlater they would try to take what was more rightfully his. Increasingly, it \nseemed that Kushner, too, might be just another staff member trying to \ntake advantage of Donald Trump. \nTrump had recently learned that a prominent New York investment \nfund, Apollo Global Management, led by the financier Leon Black, had \nprovided the Kushner Companies—the family real estate group that had \nbeen managed by Kushner himself while his father, Charlie, was in federal \nprison—with $184 million in financing. \nThis was troubling on many levels, and it left a vulnerable Kushner \nopen to more questions about the conflicts between his business and his \nposition in the White House. During the transition, Kushner had offered \nApollo's cofounder Marc Rowan, the job of director of the Office of Man-\nagement and Budget. Rowan initially accepted the job, declining it only \nafter Apollo chairman Leon Black objected to what would have to be dis-\nclosed about Rowan's and the firm's investments. \nBut the president-elect's concerns were elsewhere: he was more keenly \nand furiously focused on the fact that, in the constant search for financings \nthat occur in mid-tier real estate companies like Trump's, Apollo had never \nextended itself for the Trump Organization. Now, it seemed baldly appar-\nent, Apollo was backing the Kushners solely because of the family's con-\nnection to the administration. The constant accounting in Trump's head \nof who was profiting from whom, and his sense of what he was therefore \nowed for creating the circumstances by which everyone could profit, was \none of the things that reliably kept him up at night. \n\"You think I don't know what's going on?\" Trump sneered at his \ndaughter, one of the few people he usually went out of his way to try to \nmollify. \"You think I don't know what's going on?\" \nThe Kushners had gained. He had not. \nThe president's daughter pleaded her husband's case. She spoke of the \nincredible sacrifice the couple had made by coming to Washington. Al \nfor what? \"Our lives have been destroyed,\" she said melodramatically \nand yet with some considerable truth. The former New York socialii \nhad been reduced to potential criminal defendants and media laughir \nstocks. \nAfter a year of friends and advisers whispering that his daughter a \nson-in-law were at the root of the disarray in the White House, Trur \nonce again was thinking they should never have come. Revising histo \nhe told various of his late-night callers that he had always thought tl-\nnever should have come. Over his daughter's bitter protests, he declin \nto intercede in his son-in-law's security clearance issues. The FBI ii \ncontinued to hold up Kushner's clearance—which the president, at \ndiscretion, could approve, his daughter reminded him. But Trump ( \nnothing, letting his son-in-law dangle in the wind. \nKushner, with superhuman patience and resolve, waited for his opp \ntunity. The trick among Trump whisperers was how to focus Trun \nattention, since Trump could never be counted on to participate in ai \nthing like a normal conversation with reasonable back-and-forth. Spc \nand women were reliable subjects; both would immediately engage h: \nDisloyalty also got Trump's attention. So did conspiracies. And mone,. \nalways money. \n* * * \nKushner's own lawyer was Abbe Lowell, a well-known showboat of \nD.C. criminal bar who prided himself on, and managed his clients' exp \ntations and attention with, an up-to-the-minute menu of rumors \ninsights about what gambit or strategy prosecutors were about to dish \nThe true edge provided by a high-profile litigator was perhaps not col \nroom skill but backroom intelligence. \nLowell, adding to the reports Dowd had received, told Kushner I \nprosecutors were about to substantially deepen the president's—and \nTrump family's—jeopardy. Dowd had continued to try to mollify the ix \ndent, but Kushner, with intel supplied by Lowell, went to his father-in-law v \nreports about this new front in the legal war against him. Sure enough. \nMarch 15 the news broke that the special counsel had issued a subpo \n\fyvki.urr \nSIEGE 19 \nfor the Trump Organization records: it was a deep and encompassing order, \nreaching many years back. \nKushner also warned his father-in-law that the investigation was about \nto spill over from the Mueller team, with its narrow focus on Russian collu-\nsion, to the Southern District of New York—that is, the federal prosecutor's \noffice in Manhattan—which would not be restricted to the Russia probe. This \nwas a work-around intended to circumvent the special counsel's restriction \nto Russia-related matters, but also an effort by the Mueller team to short-\ncircuit any attempt by the president to disband or curtail its investiga-\ntion. By moving parts of the investigation to the Southern District, Mueller, \nas Kushner explained to Trump, was ensuring that the investigation of the \npresident would continue even without the special counsel. Mueller was \nplaying a canny, or ass-protecting, game, while also following precise pro-\ncedures: even as he focused on the limited area of his investigation, he was \ndivvying up evidence of other possible crimes and sending it out to other \njurisdictions, all of which were eager to be part of the hunt. \nIt gets worse, Kushner told Trump. \nThe Southern District was once run by Trump's friend Rudy Giuliani, \nthe former mayor of New York. In the 1980s, when Giuliani was the federal \nprosecutor—and when, curiously, James Comey had worked for him—\nthe Southern District became the premier prosecutor of the Mafia and of \nWall Street. Giuliani had pioneered using a draconian, and many believed \nunconstitutional, interpretation of the RICO (Racketeer Influenced and \nCorrupt Organizations) Act against the Mob. He used the same interpre-\ntation against big finance, and in 1990 the threat of a RICO indictment, \nunder which the government could almost indiscriminately seize assets, \nbrought down the investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert. \nThe Southern District had long been worrisome to Trump. After his \nelection, he had an unseemly meeting with Preet Bharara, the federal pros-\necutor there, a move whose optics were alarming to all of his advisers, \nincluding Don McGahn and the incoming attorney general, Jeff Sessions. \n(The meeting foreshadowed the one Trump would shortly have with \nComey, during which he sought a pledge of loyalty in return for job secu-\nrity.) His meeting with Bharara was unsatisfactory: Bharara was unwill-\ning to humor him—or, shortly, even to return his calls. In March 2017, \nTrump fired him. \nNow, said Kushner, even without Bharara, the Southern District was \nlooking to treat the Trump Organization as a Mob-like enterprise; its law-\nyers would use the RICO laws against it and go after the president as if he \nwere a drug lord or Mob don. Kushner pointed out that corporations had \nno Fifth Amendment privilege, and that you couldn't pardon a corpora-\ntion. As well, assets used in or derived from the commission of a crime \ncould be seized by the government. \nIn other words, of the more than five hundred companies and separate \nentities in which Donald Trump had been an officer, up until he became \npresident, many might be subject to forfeiture. One potential casualty of \na successful forfeiture action was the president's signature piece of real \nestate: the government could seize Trump Tower. \n* * * \nIn mid-March, a witness with considerable knowledge of the Trump \nOrganization's operations traveled by train to Washington to appear before \nthe Mueller grand jury. Picked up at Union Station by the FBI, the wit-\nness was driven to the federal district court. From 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., \ntwo prosecutors on the Mueller team, Aaron Zelinsky and Jeannie \nRhee, reviewed with the witness, among other issues, the structure of the \nTrump Organization. \nThe prosecutors asked the witness about the people who regularly \ntalked to Trump, how often they met with him, and for what purposes. \nThey also asked how meetings with Trump were arranged and where they \ntook place. The witness's testimony yielded, among other useful pieces of \ninformation, a signal fact: all checks issued by the Trump Organization \nwere personally signed by Donald Trump himself. \nThe Trump Organization's activities in Atlantic City were a particular \nsubject of interest that day. The witness was asked about Trump's rela-\ntionship with known Mafia members—not if he had such relationships, \nbut the nature of the relationships prosecutors already knew existed. The \nprosecutors also wanted to know about Trump Tower Moscow, a project \n\f20 MICHAEL WOLFF \npursued by Trump for many years—pursued, in fact, well into the 2016 \ncampaign—albeit never brought to fruition. \nMichael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer and a Trump Organization \nofficer, was another significant topic. The prosecutors asked questions \nabout the level of Cohen's disappointment at not being included in the \npresident's White House team. They seemed to be trying to gauge how \nmuch resentment Cohen felt, which led the witness to infer that they \nwanted to estimate how much leverage they might have if they attempted \nto flip Michael Cohen against the president. \nZelinsky and Rhee wanted to know about Jared Kushner. And they \nwanted to know about Hope Hicks. \nThe two prosecutors also delved into the president's personal life. How \noften did he cheat on his wife? With whom? How were trysts arranged? \nWhat were the president's sexual interests? The Mueller investigation, and \nits grand jury, was becoming a clearing house for the details of Trump's \nlong history of professional and personal perfidiousness. \nWhen the long day was finally over, the witness left the grand jury \nroom shocked—not so much by what the prosecutors wanted to know \nbut by what they already knew. \n* * * \nBy the third week of March, Trump's son-in-law had the president's full \nattention. \"They can not only impeach you, they can bankrupt you\" was \nKushner's message. \nAgitated and angry, Trump pressed Dowd for more reassurances, \nholding him accountable for the prior reassurances Trump had frequently \ndemanded he be given. Dowd held firm: he yet believed that the fight was \nin its early stages and that Mueller was still on a fishing expedition. \nBut Trump's patience was finally at an end. He decided that Dowd was \na fool and should go back into the retirement from which, Trump kept \nrepeating, he had rescued him. Indeed, resisting that retirement, Dowd \npleaded his own case, assuring the president that he could continue to \nprovide him with valuable help. To no avail: on March 22, Dowd reluc-\ntantly resigned, sending another bitter former Trumper into the world. \n2 \nTHE DO-OVER \nThe day John Dowd was fired, Steve Bannon was sitting at his dining \nroom table trying to forestall another threat to the Trump pres \ndency. This one wasn't about a relentless prosecutor but rather a betray( \nbase. It was about the Wall that wasn't. \nThe town houses on Capitol Hill, middle-class remnants of the nin \nteenth century, are cramped up-and-down affairs of modest parlor floc(' \nnook-y sitting rooms, and small bedrooms. Many serve as headquarte \nfor causes and organizations that can't afford Washington's vast amou \nof standard-issue office real estate. Some double as housing for th( \norganization's leaders. Many represent amateur efforts or eccentric pt \nsuits, often a kind of shrine to hopes and dreams and revolutions yet \noccur. The \"Embassy\" on A Street—a house built in 1890 and the forrr \nlocation of Bannon's Breitbart News—was where Bannon had lived a \nworked since his exile from the White House in August 2017. It was p \nfrat house, part man cave, and part pseudo-military redoubt; conspin \nliterature was scattered about. Various grave and underemployed you \nmen, would-be militia members, loitered on the steps. \nThe Embassy's creepiness and dark heart were in quite stark contr \nto Bannon's expansive and merry countenance. He might be in exile fr. \nthe Trump White House, but it was an ebullient banishment, coffee-fue \nor otherwise. \n\f22 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE 23 \nIn the last few weeks, he had helped install his allies—and first-draft \nchoices during the presidential transition—in central posts in the Trump \nadministration. Mike Pompeo had recently been named secretary of state, \nJohn Bolton would soon become the national security advisor, and Larry \nKudlow had been appointed director of the National Economic Council. \nThe president's chief political aides were Corey Lewandowski and David \nBossie, both Bannon allies, if not acolytes; both operated outside the \nWhite House and were frequent visitors at the Embassy. Many of the daily \nstream of White House defenders on cable television—the surrogates—\nwere Bannon people carrying Bannon's message as well as the president's. \nWhat's more, his enemies in the White House were moving out, includ-\ning Hope Hicks, H. R. McMaster, the former national security advisor, \nand the ever shrinking circle of allies supporting the president's son-in-\nlaw and daughter. \nBannon was often on the road. He was in Europe meeting with the \nrising populist right-wing groups, and in the U.S. meeting with hedge \nfunders desperate to understand the Trump variable. He was also looking \nfor every opportunity to try to convince liberals that the populist way \nought to be their way, too. Early in the year, Bannon went to Cambridge \nto see Larry Summers, who had been Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary, \nBarack Obama's director of the National Economic Council, and, for a \ntime, president of Harvard. Summers's wife refused to allow Bannon into \ntheir home, so the meeting happened at Harvard instead. Summers was \nmis-shaven and wearing a shirt that was missing a button or two, while \nBannon was sporting his double-shirt getup, cargo pants, and a hunting \njacket. \"Both of them looked like Asperger guys,\" said one of the people \nat the meeting. \n\"Do you fucking realize what your fucking friend is doing?\" yelled \nSummers about Trump and his administration. \"You're fucking the \ncountry!\" \n\"You elite Democrats—you only care about the margins, people who \nare rich or people who are poor,\" returned Bannon. \n\"Your trade mumbo jumbo will sink the world into a depression:' \nthundered Summers. \n\"And you've exported U.S. jobs to China!\" declared a delighted Ban-\nnon, always enjoying the opportunity to joust with a member of thc \nestablishment. \nBannon was—or at least saw himself to be—a fixer, power broker \nand kingmaker without portfolio. He was a cockeyed sort of Clad \nClifford, that political eminence and influence peddler of the 1960s an( \n'70s. Or a wise man of the political fringe, if that was not an ultimate kin( \nof contradiction. Or the head of an auxiliary government. Or, perhaps \nsomething truly sui generis: no one quite like Bannon had ever playe( \nsuch a central role in America's national political life, or been such a thorr \nin the side of it. As for Trump, with friends like Bannon, who neede( \nenemies? \nThe two men might be essential to each other, but they reviled an( \nridiculed each other, too. Bannon's constant public analysis of Trump \nconfounding nature—both its comic and harrowing components, thi \nbehavior of a crazy uncle—not to mention his indiscreet diatribes or \nthe inanities of Trump's family, continued to further alienate him from thi \npresident. And yet, though the two men no longer spoke, they hung or \neach other's words—each desperate to know what one was saying abou \nthe other. \nWhatever current feeling Bannon might have for Trump—his moo( \nranged from exasperation to fury to disgust to incredulity—he contin \nued to believe that nobody in American politics could match Trump' \nmidway-style showmanship. Yes, Donald Trump had restored showman \nship to American politics—he had taken the wonk out of politics. In sum \nhe knew his audience. At the same time, he couldn't walk a straight firm \nEvery step forward was threatened by his next lurch. Like many grea \nactors, his innate self-destructiveness was always in conflict with his keel \nsurvival instincts. Some around the president merely trusted that th. \nlatter would win over the former. Others, no matter the frustration o \nthe effort, understood how much he needed to be led by unseen hands—\nunseen being the key attribute. \nWith no one to tell him otherwise, Bannon continued, unseen, t( \nconduct the president's business from his dining-room table on A Streei \n* * * \n\f24 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE 25 \nThat afternoon, a bipartisan Congress with surprising ease had passed the \n$1.3 trillion 2018 appropriations bill. \"McConnell, Ryan, Schumer, and \nPelosi,\" said Bannon about the Republican and Democratic congressional \nleadership, \"in their singular moment of bipartisan magnanimity, put one \nover on Trump:' \nThis legislative milestone was a result of Trump's disengagement and \neverybody else's attentive efforts. Most presidents are eager to get down into \nthe weeds of the budget process. Trump took little or no interest. Hence the \nRepublican and Democratic leadership—here supported by the budget \nand legislative teams in the White House—were able to pass an enormous \nspending bill that failed to fund Trump's must-must item, the holy grail \nWall, that prospective two-thousand-mile monument meant to run the \nentire length of the border between the United States and Mexico. Instead, \nthe bill provided only $1.6 billion for border security. The current bill was in \neffect the same budget bill that had been pushed forward at the end of the \nprevious September, when the Wall had once again not been funded. In the \nfall, Trump had agreed to have the Republican-controlled Congress vote to \nextend the September budget bill. The next time it came up, the Wall would \nbe funded or, he threatened, the government would be shut down. \nEven the hardest-core Trumpers in Congress seemed content not to \nhave to die on the actual battlefield of funding the Wall, since that would \nmean embracing or at least enduring an always politically risky shutdown. \nTrump, too, in his way, seemed to understand that the Wall was more \nmyth than reality, more slogan than actual plan. The Wall was ever for \nanother day. \nOn the other hand, it was unclear what the president understood. \n\"We've gotten the budget,\" he privately told his son-in-law at the end of \nthe March budget negotiations. \"We've gotten the Wall, totally!' \n* * * \nOn Wednesday, March 21, the day before the final vote, Paul Ryan, the \nSpeaker of the House, had come to the White House to receive the presi-\ndent's blessings on the budget bill. \n\"Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forth-\ncoming:' the president shortly tweeted. \nThe White House had originally asked for $25 billion for the Wall, \nalthough high-end estimates of the Wall's ultimate cost came in at $70 \nbillion. Even then, the $1.6 billion in the appropriations bill was not so \nmuch for the Wall as for better security measures. \nAs the final vote neared, a gentlemen's agreement appeared to have \nbeen reached, one that extended to every corner of the government—\nwith, it even seemed, Trump's own tacit support, or at least his conve-\nnient distraction. The understanding was straightforward: whatever their \nstripe, members of Congress would not blow up the appropriations pro-\ncess for the Wall. \nThere were, too, Republicans like Ryan—with the backing of Repub-\nlican donors such as Paul Singer and Charles Koch—who were eager to \nwalk back, by whatever increment possible, Trump's hard-line immigra-\ntion policies and rhetoric. Ryan and others had devised a simple method \nfor accomplishing this kind of objective: you agreed with him and then \nignored him. There was happy talk, which Trump bathed in, followed by \npractical steps, which bored him. \nThat Wednesday, Trump made a series of calls to praise everyone's \nwork on the bill. The next morning, Ryan, in a televised news conference \nto seal the deal, said, \"The president supports this bill, there's no two ways \nabout it:' \nHere were the twin realities. The Wall was the most concrete manifesta-\ntion of Trumpian policy, attitude, belief, and personality. At the same time, \nthe Wall forced every Republican politician to come to terms with his or \nher own common sense, fiscal prudence, and political flexibility. \nIt was not just the expense and impracticality of the Wall, it was hav-\ning to engage in a battle for it. A government shutdown would mean a \nhigh-stakes face-off between the Trump world and the non-Trump world \nShould this come to pass, it would potentially be as dramatic a moment a; \nany that had occurred since the election of 2016. \nIf the Democrats wanted to harden the partisan division and wen \neager to find yet another example—perhaps the mother of all exam. \nples—of Trump at his most extreme, a shutdown over the Wall woulc \nhand them one. If the Republicans wanted to shift the focus from a full \nbarbarian Trump to, say, the tax bill the Congress had recently passed \n\f26 MICHAEL WOLFF SIEGE 27 \nshutting down the government would sweep that approach right off the \ntable. \nThe White House, quite behind Trump's back, was aggressively work-\ning to pass the appropriations bill and avoid a shutdown. The vice presi-\ndent gave Trump the same assurance he had been given previously when \na budget had been passed without full funding for the Wall: Pence said the \nbill provided a \"down payment\" for the Wall, a phrase whose debt-finance \nimplications seemed to amply satisfy the president and which he repeated \nwith great enthusiasm. Marc Short, the White House director of legisla-\ntive affairs, and Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Manage-\nment and Budget, in a joint appearance in the White House briefing room \nthat Thursday, shifted the debate from the Wall to the military. \"This bill \nwill provide the largest year-over-year increase in defense spending since \nWorld War IL\" said Mulvaney. \"It'll be the largest increase for our men \nand women in uniform in salary in the last ten years!' \nThe attempt to distract the Trumpian base with these bromides utterly \nfailed. The hard-core cadre insisted on forcing the issue, and Bannon was \ndelighted to serve as their general. \nWithin minutes of the budget bill's passage on March 22, Bannon, \nin the Embassy, began working the phones. Calling Trump's most ardent \nsupporters, his goal was to \"light him up.\" The effect was nearly imme-\ndiate: an unsuspecting Trump started to hear from many of those on his \nnoisy back bench, who were suddenly furious. \nBannon understood what moved Trump. Details did not. Facts did not. \nBut a sense that something valuable might be taken from him immediately \nbrought him up on his hind legs. If you confronted him with losing, he \nwould turn on a dime. Indeed, turning on a dime was his only play. \"It's \nnot that he needs to win the week, or day, or even the hour,\" reflected \nBannon. \"He needs to win the second. After that, he drifts.\" \nFor the hard-core Trumpers, it was back to a fundamental through \nline of Trumpism: you had to constantly remind Trump which side he \nwas on. As Bannon organized a howling protest from the president's base, \nhe took stock of the Trump reality: \"There simply is not going to be a Wall, \never, if he doesn't have to pay a political price for there not being a Wall.\" \nIf the Wall was not under way by the midterm elections in Novem-\nber, it would show Trump to be false and, worse, weak. The Wall needed \nto be real. The absence of the Wall in the spending bill was just what it \nseemed to be: Trump out to lunch. Trump's most effective message, the \nforward front of the Trump narrative—maximal aggression toward ille-\ngal immigrants—had been muted. And this had happened without him \nknowing it. \n* * * \nThe night of the twenty-second, the Fox News lineup—Tucker Carlson, \nLaura Ingraham, and Sean Hannity—hammered the message: betrayal. \nThe battle was on. The Republican leadership on the Hill, along with \nthe donor class, stood sober and pragmatic in the face of both political \nrealities and the prospect of unlimited billions in government spending—\nwith, certainly, no illusions that Mexico was going to pay for the Wall. \nOpposing them were the Fox pundits, righteous and unyielding in their \nappeal to the true emotion of Trumpism. \nThe personal transformation of Trump over the course of the evening \nwas convulsive. All three Fox pundits delivered a set of electric shocks: \neach rising in current. Trump had sold out the movement. Or, worse: \nTrump had been outsmarted and outwitted. Trump, on the phone, roared \nin pain and fury. He was the victim. He had no one in his corner. He could \ntrust no one. The congressional leadership: against him. The White Housc \nitself: against him. Betrayal? Almost everyone in the White House ha \nbetrayed him. \nThe next morning it got worse. Pete Hegseth, the most obsequious o: \nthe Fox Trump lovers, seemed, on Fox & Friends, nearly brought to tear: \nby Trump's treachery. \nThen, almost simultaneously with Hegseth's wailing, Trump abruptly—\nconfoundingly—shifted position and tweeted that he was considering vetoini \nthe appropriations bill. The same bill that, twenty-four hours before, h( \nhad embraced. \n\f28 \nMICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE \n29 \nThat Friday morning, he came down from the residence into the \nOval Office in a full-on rage so violent that, for a moment, his hair came \nundone. To the shock of the people with him, there stood an almost \nentirely bald Donald Trump. \nThe president's sudden change of heart sent the entire Republican \nParty into a panic. If Trump carried out his threat not to sign the bill, he \nwould bring on what they most feared: a shutdown. And he might well \nblame the shutdown on his own party. \nMark Meadows, the head of the House Freedom Caucus and a \nstaunch Trump ally in Congress, called the president from Europe to say \nthat after the vote on Thursday afternoon most members had left town for \nthe congressional recess. Congress wouldn't be able to undo the previous \nday's vote, and the shutdown was due to commence in mere hours. \nMitch McConnell rushed Defense Secretary Jim Mattis into action to \ntell the president that American soldiers would not be paid the next day if \nhe didn't sign the bill. This was a repeat performance: Mattis had issued a \nsimilar warning during a threatened shutdown in January. \n\"Never . . . never . . . never . . . again,\" Trump shouted, pounding the \ndesk after each \"never:' \nOnce again he caved and agreed to sign the bill. But he vowed that \nnext time there would be billions upon billions for the Wall or there really \nwould be a shutdown. Really. Really. \n* * * \nBannon had been here before, so many times. \n\"Dude, he's Donald fucking Trump,\" said Bannon, holding his head \nand sitting at his table in the Embassy the day after the president signed \nthe bill. \nBannon was not confused: he had a clear understanding of how great \na liability Trump could be to Bannon's own vision and career. To the ner-\nvous titters of the people around him, Bannon believed he was the man of \npopulist destiny and not Donald Trump. \nThe urgency here was real. Bannon believed he represented the \nworkingman against the corporate-governmental-technocratic machine \nwhose constituency was the college-educated. In Bannon's romantic view, \nthe workingman smelled of cigarettes, crushed your hand in his, and ww \nhard as brick—and not from working out in a gym. This remembrand( \nof things past, of (if it ever existed) a leveled world where a workingmar \nwas proud of his work and identity, was inspiring, Bannon believed, ; \nglobal anger. It was a revolution—this worldwide unease and fear an \nday-by-day upending of liberal assumptions—and it was his. The globa \nhegemon was in his sights. He was the man behind the curtain—and h, \nmight as well be in front of it, too—trying to snatch the world back fron \nits postmodern anomie and restore something like the homogenized an. \nneighborly embrace of 1962. \nAnd China! And the coming Gotterclammerung! To Bannon, thi \nwas way-of-life stuff. China was the Russia of 1962—but smarter, mor \ntenacious, and more threatening. American hedge funders, in their secr( \nsupport of China against the interests of the American middle class, wei \nthe new fifth column. \nHow much of this did Trump understand? How much was Trum \ncommitted to the ideas that moved Bannon and, by some emotion \nosmosis, the base? Trump was more than a year in, and not a shovelful . \ndirt had yet been dug for the Wall, nor a penny allocated. The Wall ar \nso much else that was part of Bannon's populist revolution—the detai \nof which he had once listed on whiteboards in his White House offic \nexpecting to check each one off—were entirely captive to Trump's inatte \ntion and wild mood swings. Trump, Bannon had long ago learned, \"does] \ngive a fuck about the agenda—he doesn't know what the agenda is!' \n* * * \nIn late March, after the gloom of the budget bill disaster had lifted, thc \nwas a brief, optimistic moment for the faithful in Trump's inner circle. \nChief of Staff John Kelly, fed up with Trump—just as Trump was f \nup with him—seemed surely on the way out. Kelly had joined the Wh \nHouse, replacing Reince Priebus, Trump's first chief of staff, in Augi \n2017, charged with bringing management discipline to a chaotic W \nWing. But by mid-fall, Trump was circumventing Kelly's new pro. \ndures. Jared and Ivanka—with many of the new rules designed to cl \ntail their open access to the president—were going over his head. \n\fMICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE \n31 \nthe end of the year, Trump was casually mocking his chief of staff and \nhis penchant for efficiency and strict procedures. Indeed, both men were \nopenly trashing each other, quite unmindful of the large audience for \ntheir slurs. For Trump, Kelly was a \"twitcher\" and \"feeble\" and ready to \n\"stroke out:' For Kelly, Trump was \"deranged\" and \"mad\" and \"stupid.\" \nThe drama just got weirder. \nIn February, Kelly, a retired four-star general, grabbed Trump adviser \nCorey Lewandowski outside the Oval Office and pushed him up against a \nwall. \"Don't look him in the eye,\" whispered Trump about Kelly after the \nincident, circling his finger next to his head in the crazy sign. The con-\nfrontation left everybody shaken, with Trump asking Lewandowski not \nto tell anyone, and Lewandowski, when talking to the people he did tell, \nsaying that he had almost wet himself. \nBy March, Trump and Kelly were hardly speaking. Trump ignored \nhim; Kelly sulked. Or Trump would drop pointed hints that Kelly should \nresign, and Kelly would ignore him. Everyone assumed the countdown \nhad begun. \nVarious Republicans, from Ryan to McConnell to their right-wing \nadversary Mark Meadows, along with Bannon, had gotten behind a plan \nto push House majority leader Kevin McCarthy for chief of staff. Even \nMeadows, who hated McCarthy, was all for it. Here finally was a strat-\negy: McCarthy, a top tactician, would refocus an unfocused White House \non one mission—the midterms. Every tweet, every speech, every action \nwould be directed toward salvaging the Republican majority. \nAlas, Trump didn't want a chief of staff who would focus him. Trump, \nit was clear, didn't want a chief of staff who would tell him anything. \nTrump did not want a White House that ran by any method other than to \nsatisfy his desires. Someone happened to mention that John F. Kennedy \ndidn't have a chief of staff, and now Trump regularly repeated this presi-\ndential factoid. \n* * * \nThe Mueller team, as it pursued the Russia investigation, continued to \nbump up against Trump's unholy financial history, exactly the rabbit hole \nTrump had warned them not to go down. Mueller, careful to protect his \nown flank, took pains to reassure the president's lawyers that he wasn't \npursuing the president's business interests; at the same time, he was pass-\ning the evidence his investigation had gathered about Trump's business \nand personal affairs to other federal prosecutors. \nOn April 9, the FBI, on instructions from federal prosecutors in New \nYork, raided the home and office of Michael Cohen, as well as a room he \nwas using in the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue. Cohen, who billed him-\nself as Trump's personal lawyer, sat handcuffed for hours in his kitchen \nwhile the FBI conducted its search, itemizing and hauling away every \nelectronic device its agents could find. \nBannon, coincidentally, also stayed at the Regency on his frequent \ntrips to New York, and he would sometimes bump into Cohen in the \nhotel's lobby. Bannon had known Cohen during the campaign, and the \nlawyer's mysterious involvement in campaign issues often worried him. \nNow, in Washington, seeing the Cohen news, Bannon knew that another \ncrucial domino had fallen. \n\"While we don't know where the end is,\" said Bannon, \"we can guess \nwhere it might begin: with Brother Cohen.\" \n* * * \nOn April 11, three weeks after the president signed the budget bill, Paul \nRyan—one of the government's most powerful figures given the Repub-\nlican lock on Washington—announced his plan to leave the Speakership \nand depart Congress. \n\"Listen to what Paul Ryan is saying:' said Bannon, sitting at his table \nin the Embassy early that morning. \"It's over. Done. Done. And Paul Ryan \nwants the fuck off the Trump train today.\" \nRyan had been telling almost anyone who would listen that as many \nas fifty or sixty House seats would be lost seven months hence in the mid-\nterm elections. A Ryan lieutenant, Steve Stivers, chairman of the National \nRepublican Congressional Committee, was estimating a loss of ninety to \none hundred seats. At this gloomy hour, it seemed more than possible \nthat the Democrats would eliminate their twenty-three-seat deficit and \n\f32 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE 3: \ngain a majority greater than the one the Republicans held now. Except, \nunlike the Republicans, theirs would be a unified party—or at least one \nthat was unified against Donald Trump. \nRyan and Stivers were hardly the only ones seeing such a result. Mitch \nMcConnell was telling donors not to even bother contributing to House \nraces. The money should go to the Senate campaign, where prospects for \nholding the Republican majority were significantly brighter. \nThis was, for Donald Trump, in Bannon's view, the most desperate \nmoment in his political career, arguably even worse than the revelation \nof the Access Hollywood grab-them-by-the-pussy tape. He was already on \nthe ropes legally, with Mueller and the Southern District bearing down; \nnow, looking at a likely wipeout in the midterm elections, he was in seri-\nous political jeopardy as well. \nBut Bannon's usual ebullience quickly returned. As he talked his \nway out of his funk, he became nearly joyful. If the establishment—\nDemocrats, Republicans, moderate thinkers of every sort—believed that \nDonald Trump needed to be run out of town, then Bannon relished the \nprospect of defending him. For Bannon, this was the mission, but it was \nalso sport. Bannon thrived on the possibility of upset. His own leap to \nthe world stage had come because the Trump campaign was so deep \nin hopelessness that he was allowed to take it over. Then, on Novem-\nber 9, 2016, against all odds and expectations, Trump, riding Bannon's \ncampaign—with Bannon's primacy soon one of the bitterest pills for \nTrump to swallow—won the presidency. Now, even with almost every \nindicator for the November elections looking bleak, Bannon believed he \ncould yet see how Republican losses could be held to under the twenty-\nthree seats needed to save the House majority. Still, it was going to be a \ngrinding fight. \n\"When Trump calls his New York friends after dinner and whines that \nhe doesn't have a friend in the world, he's kind of right,\" said a mordant \nBannon. \nBannon viewed the case against Donald Trump as both inherently \npolitical—his enemies willing to do whatever it took to bring him down—\nand essentially true. He had little doubt that Trump was guilty of most of \nwhat he was accused of \"How did he get the dough for the primary and \nthen for the general with his 'liquidity' issues?\" asked Bannon with hi: \nhands out and his eyebrows up. \"Let's not dwell.\" \nBut for Bannon there were two sides in American politics—not s( \nmuch right and left, but right brain and left brain. The left brain wa \nrepresented by the legal system, which was empirical, evidentiary, an \nmethodical; given the chance, it would inevitably and correctly convic \nDonald Trump. The right side was represented by politics, and therefor \nby voters who were emotional, volatile, febrile, and always eager to thros \nthe dice. \"Get the deplorables fired up\"—he slapped his hands in thunder \nclap effect—\"and we'll save our man:' \nAlmost a year and a half on, all of the issues of 2016 remained a \npowerful and raw as ever: immigration, white man's resentment, and th \nliberal contempt for the working—or out-of-work—white man. The yea \n2018 was, for Bannon, the real 2016: the deplorable base had become th \ndeplorable nation. \"It's civil war:' Bannon said, a happy judgment he ofte \nrepeated. \nThe most resonant issue was Donald Trump himself: the people wh \nelected him would be galvanized by the effort to take him from then \nBannon was horrified by mainstream Republican efforts to run the corn \ning election on the strength of the recent Republican tax cut. \".Are yo \nkidding? Oh my fucking god, are you kidding?\" This election was abot \nthe fate of Donald Trump. \n\"Let's have a do-over election. That's what the libs want. They ca \nhave it. Let's do it. Up or down, Trump or no Trump.\" \nImpeachment was not to be feared, it was to be embraced. \"That \nwhat you're voting for: to impeach Donald Trump or to save him froi \nimpeachment:' \nThe legal threat, however, might be moving faster than the electioi \nAnd to Bannon—who knew more about the president's hankerings, moo \nswings, and impulse-control issues than almost anyone—you could n( \nhave produced a needier or more hapless defendant. \n* * * \nSince coming aboard in the summer of 2017, the president's legal team-\nDow& Cobb, and Selculow—had delivered the message their client insist( \n\f34 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE 35 \nupon hearing, that he was not a target and would shortly be exonerated. \nBut the lawyers went even further with their feel-good strategy. \nPresidents, faced with hostile investigations by the other coequal \nbranches of government, Congress and the judiciary invariably cite exec-\nutive privilege both as a legitimate principle and as a dilatory tactic. It's a \nbuilt-in bargaining chip. But Trump's lawyers, hoisted by how often they \nhad to assure the president that he had nothing to fear, supported their \nconfident assessment, to Trump's delight, by dispensing with any claim \nof executive privilege and willingly satisfying all the special counsel's \nrequests. Trump, in all his dodginess, had become an open book. What's \nmore, Trump himself, ever believing in the force and charm of his own \npersonality, was, with his attorneys' apparent assent, eager to testify. \nAnd yet, Bannon knew, it was still much worse. The president's law-\nyers had sent more than 1.1 million documents to the special counsel, \naided by only a scant document production team. It was just Dowd, \nCobb, and two inexperienced assistants. In major litigations, docu-\nments are meticulously logged and cross-referenced into elaborate and \nefficient database systems. Here, they shipped over much of the material \nmerely as attachments, and kept minimal or no records of what exactly \nhad been sent. Few in the White House knew what they had given up and \nthus what the special counsel had. And the haphazard approach didn't \nstop there. Dowd and Cobb neither prepared many of the witnesses who \nhad worked for the White House in advance of their testimony to Mueller's \nteam nor debriefed them after they testified. \nBannon was overcome by the hilarity and stupidity of this what-me-\nworry approach to federal prosecutors whose very reputations depended \non nailing the president. Trump needed a plan—which, of course, Ban-\nnon had. \nBannon swore that he did not want to go back into the White House. \nHe wouldn't ever, he said. The humiliations of working in Trump's admin-\nistration had almost destroyed Bannon's satisfaction at having risen so \nmiraculously to the top of the world. \nSome, however, were not convinced by his protestations. They \nbelieved that Bannon actively fantasized that he would be brought back \ninto the West Wing to save Trump—and that, not incidentally, this would \nbe his ultimate revenge on Trump, saving him yet again. Bannon certainly \nbelieved that he was the only one who could pull off this difficult rescue, a \nreflection of his conviction that he was the most gifted political strategist \nof his time, and of his view that Trump was surrounded by only greater \nand lesser lummoxes. \nTrump, Bannon believed, needed a wartime consigliere. And if, he \nmused, Jared and Ivanka were finally sent packing. . . But no, he insisted, \nnot even then. \nMoreover, Trump would not be able to tolerate it. Bannon under-\nstood that only Trump could save the day, or at least that Trump believed \nonly he could save the day. No other scenario was possible. He would \nrather lose, would rather even go to jail, than have to share victory with \nsomeone else. He was psychologically incapable of not being the focus of \nall attention. \nIn the end, it was easier and more productive to give Trump advice at \na distance than up close. It was a safer play to do what needed to be done \nwithout Trump himself actually being involved with, or even aware of, \nwhat was being done. \nThe morning Ryan announced his retirement from the House, Ban-\nnon was particularly eager to send some advice Trump's way. Setting up \na deft bank shot, he invited Robert Costa, a reporter for the Washington \nPost, to visit him at the Embassy. \nBannon spent a good part of every day talking to reporters. On some \ndays, perhaps most days, his blind-quote voice—hidden behind a famil-\niar attribution such as \"this account is drawn from interviews with cur-\nrent and former officials\"—crowded out most other voices on the subject \nof whatever new crisis was engulfing the Trump administration. These \nquotes functioned as something like a stage whisper that Trump could \npretend he didn't hear. Trump, in fact, was always desperately seeking \nBannon's advice, though only if there was the slightest pretext for believ-\ning that it came from some place other than Bannon. Indeed, Trump was \nquite willing to hear Bannon say something in this or that interview and \nthen claim he had thought of it himself. \nCosta sat at Bannon's dining-room table for two hours, taking down \nBannon's prescription for how to save Trump from himself. \n\f36 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE 37 \nTrump's stupidity, said Bannon, could sometimes be made into a vir-\ntue. Here was Bannon's idea: the president should make a retroactive claim \nof executive privilege. I didn't know. Nobody told me. I was ill-advised. \nIt was hard not to see Bannon's satisfaction in a prostrate Trump \nadmitting to his own lack of guile and artfulness. \nBannon understood that this claim of retroactive executive privilege \nwould have no chance of success—nor should it. But the sheer audacity \nof it could buy them four or five months of legal delay. Delay was their \nfriend, possibly their only friend. They could work this claim of retroac-\ntive executive privilege, no matter how loopy, all the way to the Supreme \nCourt. \nFor this plan to work, the president would have to get rid of his inept \nlawyers. Oh, and he would also have to fire Rod Rosenstein, the deputy \nattorney general who was overseeing the Mueller investigation. Bannon \nhad been against the firing of Comey, and in the months after the appoint-\nment of the special counsel, he had fought the president's almost daily \nimpulse to fire Mueller and Rosenstein, seeing this as the surest invitation \nto impeachment. (\"Just don't pay attention to his crazy shit,\" he had urged \neveryone around the president.) But now they had run out of options. \n\"Firing Rosenstein is our only way out of here Bannon told Costa. \n\"I don't come to this lightly. As soon as they went to Cohen—that's what \nthey do in Mob prosecutions to get a response from the true target. So \nyou can sit there and get bled out—get indicted, go to grand juries—or \nyou can fight it politically. Get it out of the law-and-order system where \nwe are losing and are going to lose. A new DAG will review where we \nstand on this thing, which could take a couple of months. Delay, delay, \ndelay—and shift it politically. Can we win? I have no fucking idea. But I \nknow on that other path I'm going to lose. It's not perfect. . . but we live \nin a world of imperfect:' \n* * * \nCosta's story, which was posted online later that day, described Bannon as \n\"pitching a plan to West Wing aides and congressional allies to cripple the \nfederal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according \nto four people familiar with the discussions.\" But however many people \nCosta had spoken to about the background machinations of Steve Ban-\nnon, what mattered was that he had spoken directly and at length to \nBannon himself, who was using the Washington Post to pitch a plan to \nthe president. \nBannon's three-part plan for Trump instantly made its way to the \nOval Office. And the next morning, the president offered Kushner his \nview that he should fire Rosenstein, reinstate a claim of executive privi-\nlege, and get a tough-guy lawyer. \nKushner, pressing his own strategies, urged his father-in-law to move \ncautiously when it came to Rosenstein. \n\"Jared is spooked:' said a scornful Trump later that day while on the \nphone to a confidant. \"What a girl!\" \n\fSIEGE 39 \n3 \nLAWYERS \nThere was a running sweepstakes or office pool for the unhappiest \nperson in the White House. Many had held the title, but one of the \nmost frequent winners was White House counsel Don McGahn. He was \na constant target for his boss's belittling, mocking, falsetto-voice mimicry, \nand, as well, sweeping disparagements of his purpose and usefulness. \n\"This is why we can't have nice things,\" McGahn uttered almost obses-\nsively under his breath, quoting the Taylor Swift song to comment on \nwhatever egregious act Trump had just committed (\". . . because you break \nthem,\" the song continues). \nMcGahn's background was largely as a federal election lawyer. Mostly \nhe was on the more-money, less-transparency side—he was against, rather \nthan for, aggressive enforcement of election laws. He served as the counsel \nto the Trump campaign, arguably among the most careless about election \nlaw compliance in recent history. Before joining the Trump administra-\ntion, McGahn had no White House or executive branch experience. He \nhad never worked in the Justice Department or, in fact, anywhere in gov-\nernment. Formerly an attorney for a nonprofit affiliated with the Koch \nbrothers, he was known as a hyperpartisan: when Obama's White House \ncounsel, Kathy Ruemmler, the previous occupant of McGahn's office, \nreached out to congratulate him and to offer to be a resource on past prac-\ntices, McGahn did not respond to her email. \nOne of McGahn's jobs was to navigate what was possibly the most \ncomplicated relationship in modern government: he was the effective \npoint person between the White House and the Department of Justice. \nPart of his portfolio, then, was to endure the president's constant rage and \nbewilderment about why the DOJ was personally hounding him, and his \nincomprehension that he could do nothing about it. \n\"It's my Justice Department:' Trump would tell McGahn, often repeat-\ning this more than dubious declaration in his signature triad. \nNobody could quite be certain of the number of times McGahn had \nhad to threaten, with greater or lesser intention, to quit if Trump made \ngood on his threat to fire the attorney general, the deputy attorney gen-\neral, or the special counsel. Curiously, one defense against the charge that \nthe president had tried to fire Mueller in June 2017 in an effort to end the \nspecial counsel's investigation—as the New York Times claimed in a Jan-\nuary 2018 scoop—was the fact that Trump was almost constantly trying \nto fire Mueller or other DOJ figures, doing so often multiple times a day. \nMcGahn's steadying hand had so far helped avert an ultimate crisis. \nBut he had missed or let slip by or simply ignored a number of intemper-\nate, unwise, and interfering actions by the president that might, McGahn \nfeared, comprise the basis of obstruction charges. Deeply involved with the \nconservative Federalist Society and its campaign for \"textualist\" judges: \nMcGahn had long dreamed himself of becoming a federal judge him-\nself, but given the no-man's-land he occupied between Trump and the \nJustice Department—not to mention Trump's sometimes daily attacks or \nthe DOrs independence, which McGahn had to accept or condone—he \nknew his future as a jurist was dead. \n* * * \nFifteen months into Trump's tenure, the tensions between the administra-\ntion and the Department of Justice had erupted into open conflict. Now ii \nwas war—the White House against its own DOJ. \nHere was a modern, post-Watergate paradox: the independence o: \nthe Justice Department. The DOJ might be, from every organizationa \nand statutory view, an instrument of the White House, and, as much a; \nany other agency, its mission might appear to be driven by whoever hele \n\f40 MICHAEL WOLFF \nSIEGE 41 \nthe presidency. That's what it looked like on paper. But the opposite was \ntrue, too. There was a permanent-government class in the Justice Depart-\nment that believed an election ought to have no role at all in how the \nDOJ conducted itself. The department was outside politics and ought \nto be as blind as the courts. In this view, the Justice Department, as the \nnation's preeminent investigator and prosecutor, was as much a check on \nthe White House, and ought to be as independent of the White House, \nas the other branches of government. (And within the Justice Department, \nthe FBI claimed its own level of independence from its DOJ masters, as \nwell as from the White House itself.) \nEven among those at Justice and the FBI who had a more nuanced \nview, and who recognized the symbiotic nature of the department's rela-\ntionship with the White House, there was yet a strong sense of the lines \nthat cannot be crossed. The Justice Department and the FBI had, since \nWatergate, found themselves accountable to Congress and the courts. Any \ntop-down effort to influence an investigation, or any evidence of having \nbowed to influence—memorialized in a memo or email—might derail a \ncareer. \nIn February 2018, Rachel Brand, the associate attorney general, a for-\nmer Bush lawyer who had been nominated for the number three DOJ \njob by Obama, resigned to take a job as a Walmart lawyer. If Trump had \nfired Rosenstein during Brand's tenure, she would have become acting \nattorney general overseeing the Mueller investigation. She told col-\nleagues she wanted to get out before Trump fired Rosenstein and then \ndemanded that she fire Mueller. She would take Bentonville, Arkansas, \nwhere Walmart had its headquarters, over Washington, D.C. \nFor a generation or more, the arm's-length relationship between the \nWhite House and the Department of Justice often seemed more like a \nnever-ending conflict between armed camps. Bill Clinton could hardly \nstomach his attorney general, Janet Reno, having to weather the blowback \nfrom her decisions regarding Ruby Ridge, a standoff and deadly overre-\naction between survivalists and the FBI; Waco, another botched standoff \nwith a Christian cult; and the investigation of Dr. Wen Ho Lee, with the \nDOJ chastised for its reckless pursuit of a suspected spy. Clinton came \nvery close to firing Louis Freeh, his FBI director, who openly criticized \nhim, but managed to swallow his rage. Top people from the Bush White \nHouse, the FBI, and the Justice Department almost came to literal blows \nat the bedside of the ailing AG John Ashcroft—James Comey himself \nstanding in the way of the White House representatives trying to get Ash-\ncroft to renew a domestic surveillance program—with the White House \nfinally having to back down. Under Obama, Comey, who by then was the \nFBI director, made a further grab for the FBI's independence from the \nJustice Department when he unilaterally decided to end and later reopen \nthe Hillary Clinton email investigation—and, by doing so, arguably toss-\ning the election to her opponent. \nEnter Donald Trump, who had neither political nor bureaucratic \nexperience. His entire working life was spent at the head of what was in \nessence a small family operation, one designed to do what he wanted and \nto bow to his style of doing business. At the time of his election, he was \nabsent even any theoretical knowledge of modern government and its \noperating rules and customs. \nTrump was constantly being lectured about the importance of \"cus-\ntom and tradition\" at the Justice Department. As reliably, he would \nrespond, \"I don't want to hear this bullshit!\" \nHe needed, one aide observed, \"a hard, black line. Without a hard, \nblack line that he can't cross, he's crossing it:' \nTrump believed what to him seemed obvious: the DOJ and FBI \nworked for him. They were under his direction and control. They must do \nexactly what he demanded of them; they must jump through his hoops. \n\"He reports to me!\" an irate and uncomprehending Trump repeated early \nin his tenure about both his attorney general Jeff Sessions and his FBI \ndirector James Comey. \"I am the boss!\" \n\"I could have made my brother the attorney general,\" Trump insisted, \nalthough in fact he did not even speak to his brother (Robert, a seventy-\none-year-old retired businessman). \"Like Kennedy.\" (Six years after John \nF. Kennedy appointed his brother Robert attorney general, Congress \npassed the Federal Anti-Nepotism Statute, called the \"Bobby Kennedy \nlaw,\" to prevent exactly this sort of thing in the future—although that \ndid not stop Trump from hiring his daughter and son-in-law as senior \nadvisers.) \n"
