It goes without saying that any move \nwould need to make economic sense. My assumption has been that your comp would fall outside of our \"bell \ncurve\", but that is not an issue for us as long as the potential contribution also falls outside. You would not be \nthe only partner outside the curve, and I am comfortable with expanding that group for people who can \ngenuinely move the needle while embracing the culture that makes us who we are. \nOne benefit of having Michael in the mix is that he can provide a global perspective, and he would be important \nfor explaining the case outside the US if we moved forward. \nJust let me know when and how you want to speak next. \nBest, \nSteve \nStephen Immelt \nPartner and CEO \nHogan Lovells US LLP - Washington, DC office \nColumbia Square \n555 Thirteenth Street, NW \nWashington, DC 20004 \nTel: \nDirect: \nFax: \nEmail: \nwww.hoganlovells.com \nHogan Lovells International LLP - London office \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025908 \nAtlantic House \nHolborn Viaduct \nLondon EC 1A 2FG, United Kingdom \nTel: \nDirect \nPlease consider the environment before printing this e-mail. \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Kathy Ruemmler [ \nSent: Saturday, February 27, 2016 10:08 AM \nTo: Immelt, Stephen J. \nSubject: Re: Follow up \nHi Steve, \nI am still intrigued and would like to meet Michael. I thinks it makes sense, though, for us to have a more \nspecific conversation about compensation before I meet with him. I don't want to put the cart before the horse, \nbut as I mentioned, this would be a big move for me, and it would have to make sense economically in addition \nto being the right move for other reasons we have discussed. \nI hope you are well. Cannot believe that Christie endorsed Trump! \nBest, \nKathy \nSent from my iPad \nOn Feb 25, 2016, at 5:23 AM, Immelt, Stephen J. wrote: \nKathy \nI don't want to pester you, but in the hope that you are still intrigued, I wanted to suggest that we try to set up an \nopportunity for you to meet Michael Davison, our global head of litigation.
