[jeevacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: Re: \nImportance: High \nMy sister's in a wheelchair the cancer is getting worse, she's just about done, so trying to spend some time \nwith her. My mother's alzheimer's has gotten worse, but it's not so bad, I tell her whatever I want her to know, \nlike my father is off at work and coming home soon and I have a beautiful wife and 3 kids that very much \nenjoyed her company yesterday and she's happy, so I've figured out how to manage that one. Otherwise no \nnews, going to Brazil in a few weeks. If you're still interested in Joy I'll let them know, I remember they wanted \nto meet you at Paris when they went for VS show, so not sure what their future plans are, but Marcelo - one \nof the owners/investors - will probably try to impress you Brazilian style (over-stating/inflating everything), \nbut the girls are there and they're trying to network in Eastern Europe, so if you get involved for that reason \nalone I guess you'll be satisfied at the end of the day. \nCongrats on your Trump.... but if any of that is true I guess he will be impeached (fingers crossed, lo1). \nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nSent: January 12, 2017 9:06 AM \nTo: Ramsey Elkholy \nSubject: \nnews? \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
