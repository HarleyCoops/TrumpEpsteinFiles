Thanks again for your help! Would love to talk to him, or travel to meet with him if that would be possible. \n-What is he chiefly focusing on now? Is he spending more time on The Jeffrey Epstein Science Foundation? Could he talk about his \ninterest in science and the 2011 grants/conference? \n-How has his business been affected? Is there any new direction he's taking it? Does he still have the same clients or new ones? Is it \nstill at $15 billion? \n-Did he still work while in prison? How was that arranged? With whom was he working/advising? \n-Where is he spending his time now? How has his social life changed from three years ago? \n-Is he still close with Ghislaine Maxwell? Someone said she lives with him (but that doesn't sound right)? \n-What were friends/colleagues/acquaintances reactions to his conviction? \n-What does he think about the sentence he got- was it too lenient or too harsh and why? \n-What is his side of the story and have people been supportive? \n-Is he continuing the charity initiatives he started with Bill Clinton, etc? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021399 \n"
