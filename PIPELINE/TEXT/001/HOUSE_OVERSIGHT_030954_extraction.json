I was stuck at the White House and he had a narrow window \nbefore heading to Cyprus. I just sent him the following note: \n\"Good Morning, I hope your travels to Cyprus were smooth. \nOkey Enelamah, Nigeria's trade minister, stopped by my home this evening as he was still in town after Buhari's \nvisit with Trump. He mentioned his discussions with you at WEF and afterwards. Separately, I spoke earlier \nwith the Vice President. \nWhenever we meet, I have some thoughts that may be helpful to you.\" \nOn May 2, 2018, at 11:05, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \n011971 50 644 8444 he is cahriman of bubai world ports. african ports a new focus he built the palm \nislands. is totally trustworthy \nOn Wed, May 2, 2018 at 10:55 AM Jide Zeitlin wrote: \nThank you for the introduction.
