What is the difference between money laundering and terrorist financing?\nln contrast to money laundering, which involves the disguising of funds derived from illegal activity so they may be\nused without detection of the illegal activity, terrorist financing can involve the use of legally derived money to carry\nout illegal activities. The objective of money laundering is financial gain or the hiding or disguising of illicit proceeds,\nwhereas with terrorism, the objective is to promote the agenda or cause of the terrorist organization. For example, it\nis widely believed that the terrorist activities of September 11,2001, were partially financed by legally obtained funds\nthat had been donated to charities. Both money launderers and terrorists, however, do need to disguise the\nassociation between themselves and their funding sources.\n8. ls the approach to combat money laundering and terrorist financing the same?\nAlthough some of the risk factors and red flags that apply to other types of money laundering also may apply to\nterrorisl fìnancing, the patterns of activity tend to be very different. Terrorist fìnancing often involves very small\namounts of fundð, which may be moved through charities or nontraditional banking systems, whereas other types of\nmoney laundering may involve large volumes of funds. lt is important to understand the different patterns to protect\nagainst the risks.\nOverv¡ew of U.S. AML Laws and Regulations\n9. What are the key U.S. AML laws and regulations?\nThe key U.S. AML laws and regulations are the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA) and the Uniting and Strengthening\nAmericã by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to lntercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (commonly\nreferred to as the USA PATRIOT Act).\nThe BSA was the first major money laundering legislation in the United States. lt was designed to deter the use of\nsecret foreign bank accounts and provide an audit trail for law enforcement by establishing regulatory reporting and\nrecordkeeping requirements to help identify the source, volume and movement of currency and monetary instruments\ninto or out of ihe United States or deposited in financial institutions. For additional guidance on the Bank Secrecy Act,\nplease refer to the Bank Secrecv Act section.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26,2001, following the\nterrorist activity of September 11. Title lll, the lnternational Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing\nAct of 2001 , deals with money laundering and terrorist financing. Title lll made significant changes to money\nlaundering regulations, imposed enhanced requirements for AML programs, and significantly expanded the scope of\ncoveragelo nonbank financial institutions. lt requires financial institutions to establish AML programs that include\npolicies, procedures and controls, designation of a compliance officer, training, and independent review. lt also\nrequires, among other things, that certain financial institutions establish customer identification procedures for new\naccounts as well as enhanced due diligence (EDD) for correspondent and private banking accounts maintained by\nnon-U.S. persons. For additional guidance on the USA PATRIOT Act, please refer to the USA PATRIOT Act section'\n10. What other AML laws have been enacted in the United States?\nln addition to the BSA and Title lll of the USA PATRIOT Act, other AML laws include the Money Laundering Control\nAct of 1986 (MLCA), the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992, the\nMoney Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 (MLSA), and the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act\nof 1 998.\nThe MLCA established two AML criminal statutes that, for the first time, made money laundering a criminal offense,\nwith penalties of up to 20 years and fines of up to $500,000 for each count. Additionally, the MLCA prohibits the\nstructuring of currency transactions to avoid filing requirements and requires financial institutions to develop BSA\ncompliance programs.\nThe primary purpose of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 was to provide funding and technical assistance to state and\nlocal units óf government to combat crime and drug abuse. This Act increased the civil and criminal penalties for\nmoney laundering and other BSA violations to include forfeiture of any property or asset involved in an illegal\ntransaction related to money laundering. lt introduced the'sting' provision, which enables law enforcement to\nrepresent the source of funds involved in a transaction as the proceeds of unlawful activity. This Act also required the\nidentification and recording of purchases of monetary instruments, including bank checks or drafts, foreign drafts,\ncashier's checks, money orders or travelels checks in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000 inclusive. This\nlegislation, in conjunction with the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Reauthorization Act of 1998,\nprotiviti 111\n\nauthorized the Director of the ONDCP to designate areas within the United States that exhibit serious drug traffìcking\nproblems and harmfully impact other areas of the country as High lntensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HlDTAs). The\nHIDTA program aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug control efforts among local, state and federal\nlaw enforcement agencies.\nThe Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 gave protection from civil liability to any financial institution,\nor director, officer or employee thereof, who/that makes a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) under any local, state or\nfederal law. The Annunzio-Wylie Act made it illegal to disclose when a SAR is filed. lt also made it illegal to operate a\nmoney transmitting business without a license where such a license is required under state law, and required all\nfinancial institutioni to maintain records of domestic and international funds transfers. ln addition, this Act introduced\nthe'death penalty,\" mandating that bank regulators consider taking action to revoke the charter of any banking\norganization that is found guilty or pleads guilty to a charge of money laundering.\nThe Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 (MLSA) specifically addressed money services businesses (MSBs),\nrequiring each MSB to register and maintain a list of its agents. ln addition to making it a federal crime to operate an\nunregistered MSB, the MLSA encouraged states to adopt uniform laws applicable to MSBs. lt also established\nprocédures that allowed banks to exempt certain customers from Currency Transaction Report (CTR) filing.\nContinuing with the trend of developing a national strategy to combat money laundering, the Money Laundering and\nFinancial Ôrimes Strategy Act of 1998 called for the designation of areas at high-risk for money laundering and\nrelated financial crimes by geography, industry, sector or institution. Some of these areas were later designated as\nHigh Risk Money Laundering and Related Financial Crimes Areas (HlFCAs). The HIFCA program was created to\ncoórdinate the efforts of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in the fìght against money laundering.\nThe lntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended the BSA to require the U.S. Treasury\nSecretary to prescribe regulations requiring certain financial institutions to report cross-border electronic transmittals\nof funds, if the Secretary determines such reporting is 'reasonably necessary' to aid in the fight against money\nlaundering and terrorist financing.\n11. What is the role of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and how does it fit into\nAML laws and regulations?\nThe purpose of OFAC is to promulgate, administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions against certain\nindividuals, entities and foreign government agencies and countries whose interests are considered to be at odds\nwith U.S. policy. Sanctions programs target, for example, terrorists and terrorist nations, drug traffìckers and those\nengaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nOverviews and details of the OFAC Sanctions programs can be found on OFAC's website at www.treas.oov/ofac\nOFAC regulations are not part of AML compliance per se, but since the OFAC Sanctions lists include alleged money\nlaunderers and terrorists and USA PATRIOT Act requirements mandate that certain financial institutions vet customer\nnames against the OFAC list, institutions often consider the OFAC program to be a subset of their overall AML\nprogram. For additional guidance, please refer to the\nSanctions Proorams section.\n12. How can one measure the effectiveness of an AML regime?\nA number of factors can be considered when assessing the effectiveness of an AML regime, including the number of\nmoney launderingiterrorist financing investigations, prosecutions and convictions, number and amount of\nfrozen/seized assets, identification of deficiencies in financial institutions in examinations by regulatory authorities,\nand quality of coordination among financial institutions, regulatory and law enforcement authorities. For additional\nguidance on tools and techniques used to assess the effectiveness of AML systems, please referto the Financial\nAction Task Force section.\n13. How do U.S. regulations compare to international AML regulations?\nThe United States' role as a leader in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing dates back 40 years\nto the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970. Through the ensuing decades and especially following the terrorist\nactivities of September 11,2001 , the United States has reinforced its commitment through the passage of a number\nof additional money laundering-related laws, issuance of extensive regulatory guidance and aggressive enforcement.\nThat said, the United States, as with many other major jurisdictions, is not in full compliance with the FATF\nRecommendations. ln fact, FATF in its most recent assessment of the United States' anti-money regime, identified\nseveral areas in need of improvement, including: customer due diligence relating to beneficial owners, authorized\nprotiviti 112\n\nsigners, legal persons and trusts; ongoing due diligence; and general requirements for designated nonfinancial\nbùsinesseõ and professions (DNFBP¡) (e.g., casinos, accountants, attorneys, dealers in precious metals and stones'\nreal estate agents).\nFor additional guidance, please refer to the Financial Action Task Force and Mutual Evaluations sections.\nFor additional guidance on international perspectives, please refer to the\nsection.\n14. What are the consequences of not complying with AML laws and regulations?\nThe consequences of noncompliance with AML laws and regulations may include regulatory enforcement actions,\ncivil and criminal penalties, seizure and forfeiture of funds, and incarceration for the individuals involved. Depository\ninstitutions also may be subject to restrictions on growth and expansion and, in the extreme, may have their\ncharters/licenses revoked, a consequence known as the'death penalty.\" For additional guidance, please refer to the\nEnforcement Actions section.\n15. What factors are considered by law enforcement when it assesses whether an institution\nor its personnel are guilty of aiding and abetting money laundering or terrorist financing?\nWhen assessing whether an institution or its personnel are guilty of aiding and abetting money_laundering or terrorist\nfinancing, the author¡ties consider, among other factors, the following 'standards of knowledge':\n. Reckless Disregard -\nr Willful Blindness - Deliberate ignorance and failure to follow up in the face of information that suggests\nprobable money laundering or illicit activity\no Collective Knowledge - Aggregates/attributes the knowledge of employees to the employing company\nCareless disregard for legal or regulatory requirements and sound business practice\nIt is important to remember that under U.S. law, a company may, in general, be held liable for the actions of its\nemployees, regardless of the number or level of employees involved in the wrongdoing.\nOverview of the U.S. Regulatory Framework\nKey U.S. Regulatory Authorities and Law Enforcement\nAg e n c¡es\n16. Who has the authority to assess penalties for violations of AML laws and regulations?\nAuthority to assess civil penalties rests with the Secretary of the Treasury and is delegated to the Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network 1ÈinCeU¡ and the primary federal regulators or Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) (e.9.'\nFinancial lndustry Regulatory Authority tFlNRAl). Some state regulatory agencies have their own authority to assess\ncivil penalties, as weli Crimiñal penalties are determined through legal proceedings at state orfederal levels.

What is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and what is its role in AML\nregulation?\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department, was established in\n1990 by Treasury Ordel|05-08. lts mission is to safeguard the financial system from abuses of financial crime. lt is\nthe Finâncial lntelligence Unit (FlU) of the United States, formed to support law enforcement and the fìnancial\ncommunity in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes through the collection,\nanalysis and sharing of gSR information. FinCEN seeks to provide adequate financial intelligence to law enforcement\nwithout overburdening the financial community or compromising the privacy of individuals.\nThe many partnerships of FinCEN are not limited to the United States, but expand internationally to law enforcement,\nfinancial institutions and regulatory authorities in foreign countries' as well.\nWhile FinCEN relies primarily on federal functional regulators to examine financial institutions and enforce AML\ncompliance, the reguiators look to FinCEN for guidance in the implementation of the BSA and USA PATRIOT Act'\nf¡nigru has issued regulations, in concert with federal functional regulators and the lnternal Revenue Service (lRS),\nrelated to BSA and AML compliance. FinCEN may issue enforcement actions for violations of the BSA and USA\nPATRIOT Act through ¡ts Office of Enforcement jointly or unilaterally. The Office of Enforcement evaluates\nenforcement matters, including the assessment of civil money penalties.\n24. ln what types of initiatives does FinCEN engage?\nln 1992, as part of the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act, FinCEN formed the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory\nGroup (BSAAG), a task force established to coordinate and inform the fìnancial community about BSA-related\nmatters. The BSAAG includes senior representatives from financial institutions, federal law enforcement agencies,\nregulatory agencies, and others from the public and private sectors. ln 2009, the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task\nfoice 1fÉeff) was established as a multi-agency task force with federal, state and local partners to improve efforts\nto investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, recover proceeds for victims, and address financial\ndiscrimination in the lending and financial markets.\nFinCEN also has created several communication systems to facilitate the sharing of information among both\ndomestic and international entities. The BSA E-Filing System allows fìnancial institutions to file electronic BSA forms,\nsuch as CTRs and SARs, quickly and securely. The Gateway program enables law enforcement agencies and\nfinancial industry regulators to have expedited access to BSA records fìled with FinCEN. The Law Enforcement and\nFinancial lnstituiionlnformation Sharing (LEFllS) system allows law enforcement to receive feedback from financial\ninstitutions on subjects of money laundering and terrorism investigations, and is used to facilitate information sharing\namong financial institutions. FinCEN also developed the Egmont Secure Web (ESW), which is a private network that\nallowJconnected FlUs to interface with FinCEN and each other to access information related to money laundering\ntrends, analytical tools and technological developments via e-mail.\nAdditional tools include the Geographic Threat Assessments and Nontraditional Methodologies Sections, a resource\ncenter for emerging methods of money laundering and terrorist financing.\nFinCEN also collaborates with other FlUs globally to exchange information supporting AML and counterterrorism\ninitiatives worldwide, and assists other countries with developing their FlUs.

The MOU also gives F|ñCEN authority to issue its own enforcement actions, even when regulators may\nnoi think it is necessary. Oñ April 26,2005, FinCEN and the New York State Banking Department entered into a\nsimilar MOU; shortly thereafter, a number of other states followed suit'\nln late 2006, the SEC and FinCEN entered into an MOU under which the SEC provides FinCEN with detailed\ninformation on a quarterly basis regarding the AML examination and enforcement activities of the SEC and the Self-\nRegulatory Organizationé (SROs). ln return, FinCEN provides assistance and analytical reports to the SEC.\nprotiviti I 1e\n\nln June 2011, FinCEN entered into an MOU with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which provides\nthe CFPB direct electronic access to BSA information and analytical materials (e.9., analytical tools, BSA information\nreviews, etc.) as required and appropriate forthe exercise of the CFPB's regulatory authority. ln return, the CFPB,\nupon request, will provide reports on the results of its investigations or examinations and statistical information related\nto any inquiries to assist FinCEN in understanding and analyzing the value of BSA information.\nEnforcement Actions\n27. What types of enforcement actions are available to regulators for addressing AML\nCompliance Program deficiencies and violations?\nRegulators have a range of enforcement tools available to address AML Compliance Program defìciencies and\nviolations of AML laws and regulations.\nWhile enforcement actions against nonbanks have increased in recent years, the number of enforcement actions\nissued by bank regulators coñtinues to outnumber those of other agencies, at least in the United States. Examples of\nenforcement actions available to U.S, bank regulators in order of severity are:\n. Commitment Letter: A Commitment Letter is an agreement between a bank's board of directors and a bank\nregulator in which the board, on behalf of a bank, agrees to take certain actions to address issues or concerns\nsurfaced by the regulator. A Commitment Letter is not legally binding, but the failure of a bank to live up to the\nterms of the Commitment Letter may subject the bank to more formal regulatory action.\n. Memorandum of Understanding: A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is an agreement between a bank's\nboard of directors and one or more regulatory agencies. The content of an MOU may be similar or identical to\nmore formal enforcement actions, but MOUs are nonpublic documents and, similar to Commitment Letters, not\nlegally binding.\n. Formal Agreements: A Formal Agreement is an agreement between a bank's board of directors and one or\nmore regulatory agencies. While the contents of a Formal Agreement may mirror those of an MOU, violations of\na Formal Agreement can provide the legal basis for assessing civil money penalties (CMPs) against directors,\nofficers and other institution-affiliated parties.\no Gonsent Order or Order to Cease and Desist (C&D): Consent Orders and Orders to Cease and Desist are\nagreements between a bank's board of directors and one or more regulatory agencies. Violations of a Formal\nAgreement can provide the legal basis for assessing civil money penalties (CMPs) aga¡nst directors, offìcers and\nother institution-affiliated parties. The regulator's decision to issue a Consent Order or Order to Cease and Desist\nrather than a formal agreement is based on its assessment of the severity of the bank's problems.\n¡ Civil Money Penalties (CMPs): Civil money penalties are financial penalties that may be imposed by a regulator\nagainst a bank or an individual(s) for a violation of law or regulation or noncompliance with a formal enforcement\naction.\no ,,Death Penalt¡/': Under the Annunzio-Wiley Act of 1992, bank regulators have the option - in fact, are obligated\nto consider - whether the license/charter of a depository institution that is found guilty or pleads guilty to money\nlaundering charges should be revoked. The revocation of a license/charter is known as the \"Death PenalÇ.\"\nUnlike the formal enforcement actions issued by bank regulators, which are usually very prescriptive as to the actions\nthat must be taken to address the identified deficiencies, the enforcement actions taken by securities and\nfutures/commodities regulators generally report findings that detail the nature of the deficiency, but do not prescribe\nspecific corrective action (and accompanying fines have been modest compared to those levied against banks).\n28. Does FinCEN have enforcement authority?\nFinCEN does have enforcement action authority, which it often uses in conjunction with a financial institution's\nfunctional regulators.\n29. Beyond the actions and penalties that may be imposed by regulators, are U.S.\ncompanies subject to any other potential actions?\nYes. Other actions, such as Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPA), may result from legal actions.\nprotiviti l20\n\n30 What is a Deferred Prosecution Agreement?\nA DPA is an agreement entered into between a prosecutor and a defendant in a criminal case whereby in exchange\nfor successful completion of agreed-upon commitments, the criminal charges against the defendant will be dismissed\nin their entirety by the prosecutor.\n31. What enforcement actions have had a significant impact on the AML landscape?\nCertain enforcement actions stand out because of the size of the penalties imposed on the institutions and/or the\nmedia attention they received. Examples would include:\no BankingOrganizations:\nABN Amro: ln December 2005, ABN Amro was assessed an $80 million Civil Money Penalty (CMP) for\nfailure to implement an adequate system of internal controls reasonably designed to assure compliance\nw1h U.S. AML laws and regulations. The CMP cited deficiencies within the North American Regional\nClea¡ng Center (NARCC), a unit within the New York Branch of ABN Amro that operated as a clearing\ncenter for funds transfers in U.S. dollars for members within the ABN Amro network and more than 400\nthird-party financial institutions. Specific findings included the following:\n. Failure to staff the compliance function and train compliance personnel adequately\n. Failure to file accurate and timely Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)\n. Lack of formal procedures for collecting and reviewing due diligence and assessing the risks of\nforeign financial institutions accessing correspondent banking services\n. Lack of adequate monitoring of funds transfers for potentially suspicious activity, particularly\nfunds transfers conducted by financial institutions independent of the ABN Amro network\n. Failure to incorporate information on subjects of previous SAR filings, terminated relationships,\nand publicly available information on shell companies into its suspicious activity monitoring\nprogram\n. Failure to investigate alerts and utilize the capabilities of its automated monitoring software to\nmanage its money laundering and terrorist financing risk effectively\nAmerican Express: ln August 2007, American Express lnternational Bank (AEIB) was issued a Cease\nand Desist (C&D) order and assessed a $20 million CMP and $55 million forfeiture. American Express\nTravel Related Services Co. (AETRSC) also was assessed a $5 million CMP. Cross-border payment\nmade total effective charges, including forfeiture, $65 million. AEIB provided private banking services to\nhigh net worth clients and AETRSC operated as a money services business (MSB). Specific findings\nincluded the following :\n. Failure to implement comprehensive customer due diligence (CDD) and enhanced due\ndiligence (EDD) processes\n. Failure to implement effective control measures for bearer shares and other private investment\ncompanies (PlCs)\n. Failure to adhere to the internal policies for periodic reviews of high-risk accounts\n. lnadequate transaction monitoring system due to data integrity and other problems\nr lnadequate independent testing of the AML Compliance Program\n. Failure to provide adequate oversight of and accountability for the AML Compliance Program\nby management of AEIB and its parent company, AEB\nWachovia: ln March 20'10, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), FinCEN and the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) announced that Wachovia Bank, N.4., had agreed to a Deferred\nProsecution Agreement with a forfeiture of $110 million with the DOJ, a civil money penalty of $50\nmillion, a C&D with the OCC, and a civil money penalty (CMP) of $1 l0 million with FinCEN. FinCEN\nagreed its CMP would be satisfied by the payment of the DOJ forfeiture. Specifìcfindings included the\nfollowing:\n. Failure to implement adequate policies, procedures and controls for bulk cash transactions\nconducted by high-risk casas de cambìo and other foreign correspondent banking customers\nprotiviti 121\n. Failure to conduct monitoring of the high volume of monetary instruments through casas de\ncambio and other foreign correspondent customers using Remote Deposit Capture (RDC)\nservlce\n. Failure to monitor sequentially numbered traveler's checks used by casas de cambio and other\nforeign correspondent customers in a manner compliant with internal policy on these\ntransactions\n. Failure to institute appropriate risk-based monitoring of foreign correspondent banking\ncustomers - primarily as a result of setting alert parameters based on staffing capacity\n. Failure to file timely SARs on several foreign correspondent banking customers\n. Failure to report cash structuring activity\nHSBC: ln October2010, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it had issued a Cease and Desist\nOrder between HSBC North America Holdings, lnc, (HNAH), New York, New York, a registered bank\nholding company (BHC), and the Federal Reserve Board. The order requires HNAH to take corrective\nact¡on to improve its firm-wide compliance risk management program, including its anti-money\nlaundering compliance risk management. Concurrent with the Federal Reserve Board's announcement\nof its enforcement action, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced its issuance of a\nCease and Desist Order against HSBC Bank USA, N.4., Mclean, Virginia (HBUS, a subsidiary of\nHNAH), for violating the Bank Secrecy Act and its underlying regulations.\nHSBC was directed to use its financial and managerial resources as a source of strength for its bank\nsubsidiaries, and in particular HBUS, to ensure that it complies with the OCC Consent Order regarding\nHBUS' BSA/AML program. lt was also directed to 'retain an independent consultant acceptable to the\n[Chicago Federal] Reserve Bank to complete a review of the effectiveness of the firm-wide BSA/AML\nCompliance Program adopted by HNAH (the 'BSA/AML Review'), and to prepare a written report of\nfindings and recommendations (the 'BSA/AML Report').\" ln another section of the Order, HNAH was\ndirectèd to 'submit to the [Chicago Federal] Reserve Bank an acceptable written program designed to\nreasonably ensure the identifìcation and timely, accurate, and complete reporting by HNAH and its\nsubsidiaries of all known or suspected violations of law or suspicious transactions to law enforcement\nand supervisory authorities, as required by applicable suspicious activity reporting laws and\nregulations.'\nThe OCC Order states that the agency found deficiencies in HBUS' BSAJAML Compliance Program - in\nparticular, deficiencies in internal controls for customer due diligence, procedures for monitoring\nsuspicious activity and independent testing. The Order also cited aggravating factors 'such as highly\nsuspicious activity creating a significant potential for unreported money laundering or terrorist financing.\"\nSpecific cited deficiencies included special handling of wire transfers of customers domiciled in\ncountries risk-rated as 'standard' or'medium,' resulting in limited and ineffective BSA/AML monitoring\nof two{hirds of the bank's wire activity; failure from 2006 to 2009 to monitor bulk cash transactions with\nforeign affìliates; failure to perform customer due diligence or enhanced due diligence for its foreign\naffiliates, inhibiting its assessment of customer risk and the identification of suspicious activity in\naccounts of those affiliates; failure to address a backlog of suspicious activity alerts (due to inadequate\nstaffing), which caused the bank to file many late SARs; and failure to appropriately designate\ncustomers as 'high-risk'for BSA/AML monitoring, even when a customeis association with PEPs could\nharm the bank's reputation. ln July 2012, HSBC was the subject of a hearing held by the Senate\nPermanent Subcommittee on lnvestigations entitled 'U.S. Vulnerabilities to Money Laundering and\nTerrorist Financing: HSBC Case History.'\nCitibank: ln April 2012, the OCC issued a Cease and Desist Order against Citibank, N.A. for violations\nof the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and underlying regulations. According to the OCC, the order requires\nthe bank to take comprehensive corrective actions to improve its BSA compliance program.\nThe compliance program allegedly had defìciencies with respect to internal controls, customer due\ndiligence, the independent BSA and the anti-money laundering audit function, monitoring of its remote\ndeposit capture and international cash letter instrument processing in connection with foreign\ncorrespondent banking, and suspicious activity reporting related to that monitoring. These fìndings\nresulted in violations by the bank of statutory and regulatory requirements to maintain an adequate BSA\ncompliance program, file suspicious activity reports, and conduct appropriate due diligence on foreign\ncorrespondent accounts.\nprotiviti 122\n\nAs part of the Order, the Bank is required to arrange for an independent look back for suspicious activity\ncovering areas (and presumably time frames) to be designated by the bank's Examiner-in-Charge.\n. Broker-Dealers:\no E\"TRADE: ln January 2009, FINRA assessed a $1 million penalty against E\"Trade Securities and E\"\nTrade Clearing LLC for failure to implement AML policies and procedures to reasonably detect and\nreport potentially suspicious securities transactions. Alerts triggered in the automated monitoring system\nwere limited to those with money movements, thereby eliminating detection and review of potentially\nsuspicious matched or washed trades. The firms relied upon analysts to monitor high-volume online\ntrading activity for potentially suspicious activity manually, without providing necessary automated\nmonitoring tools.\nAdditionally, in July 2008, both firms reached a $1 million settlement with the SEC for failure to\ndocument their Customer ldentification Program (ClP) and verify the identities of more than 65,000\nclients from October 2003 to June 2005.\nr Money Services Businesses (MSBs):\nSigue Corporation: ln January 2008, FinCEN assessed a $12 million CMP on Sigue Corporation for\nfaiiure to implement an effective AML Compliance Program in all four core elements as defined in the\nUSA PATRIOT Act: internal controls, designation of compliance officer/personnel, training, and\nindependent testing. The U.S. Department of Justice assessed a $15 million forfeiture and entered into\na Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA). Payment of the forfeiture satisfied the FinCEN penalty.\nSpecific findings included the following:\n. Lack of defined roles and responsibilities of the compliance function\n. Failure to implement a risk-based suspicious activity monitoring program commensurate with\ndollar volume and geographic reach\n'\nLack of effective supervision and control over agents (e.9., agents advising customers to\nstructure transactions to evade AML reporting requirements)\n. Failure to investigate alerts in a timely manner\n'\n'\nFailure to file complete, accurate or timely Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)\nlnadequate and untailored training program and/or training program not completed by all\nemployees/agents\n. lnadequate independent testing (e.g., not risk-based, insufficient testing, narrow scope) that\nfailed to identify system problems within the AML Compliance Program\nFrom 2010 to 2011, seven MSBs were subject to enforcement actions primarily for failure to register\nwith FinCEN as an MSB. All were acting as independent money transmitters. A summary of fìndings\nincluded the following :\n. Failure to register as an MSB or complete biennial renewals with FinCEN\n. Failure to implement an AML program as required for money transmitters\n. Failure to report potentially suspicious transactions on SARs\n. Structuring currency transactions to evade BSA reporting requirements\n. Conspiracy to commit food stamp fraud\n32. What have been the most common deficiencies in AML Compliance Programs?\nSome common themes have been:\nProgram Violations: Overall failures supported by'pillaf violations, i.e., the failure of an institution to address\nadequately its obligation to designate a qualified AML compliance officer; develop and implement appropriate\npolicies, procedures and controls; provide adequate training; and perform periodic independent testing of its AML\nCompliance Program.\nSystemic and Recurring Violations: Pervasive control breakdowns\nprotiviti 123\n. lsolated and Technical Violations: Limited instances of noncompliance that do not threaten overall program\neffectiveness\nSome common problems and issues include, but are not limited to, the following:\n¡ AML compliance officer (as well as other employees) lacks sufficient experience andior knowledge regarding\nAML policies, procedures and tools\n¡ lnsufficienVinadequate resources dedicated to AML compliance\no Lack of specific and customized training of employees with critical functions (e.9., account opening, transaction\nprocessing, risk management)\nr Failure to conduct adequate risk assessments (e.g., customer risk assessment, business line risk assessment,\nOFAC risk assessment)\no Failure to incorporate risk assessments into a transaction-monitoring process, customer acceptance standards,\naudits, testing or training\nr lnadequate Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures (e.9., ClP, CDD and EDD at or after account opening,\nincluding inadequate controls over required fìelds, inadequate methods of obtaining and/or maintaining current\ninformatlon, lack of reporting capabilities over missing information, and lack of verification procedures)\nr Poor documentation maintained for investigations that did not lead to SAR fìlings\n. Poorfollow-up on SAR actions (e.9., close, monitor)\n. Lack of reporting of key SAR information to senior managemenVboard of directors\no lnadequate tuning, validation and documentation of automated monitoring systems\no Overreliance on software to identify transactions for which CTRs and/or SARs must be filed without fully\nunderstanding how the software is designed and what information it does/does not capture\nr Exclusion of certain products from transaction monitoring (e.g., loans, letters of credit, capital markets activities)\n. Lack of timeliness when filing CTRs and SARs (e.g., reports are manually fìled via certified mail, and the date\npostmarked is not noted)\no Lack of or inadequate independent testing of the AML Compliance Program\no Lack of or untimely corrective actions to prior examination or audit findings\nTo identify potential gaps in a fìnancial institution's AML Compliance Program, regulatory enforcement actions for\nAML defiðiencies agãinst other (similar) financial institutions should be reviewed to identify the specific violations and\nrelated action steps-. This enables fìnancial institutions to recognize and correct any potential weaknesses of their\nown before their next regulatory examination.\nAML Compliance Program\n33. What types of financial institutions are required to comply with AML laws and\nregulations?\nUnder the USA PATRIOT Act, the definition of 'financial institutions\" was expanded to include more than 20 different\ntypes of businesses that provide financial services, including, but not limited to, broker-dealers, currency exchangers,\n¡ñiurance companies, trust compan¡es, dealers in precious metals, stones or jewels, and issuers of travele/s checks,\nmoney orders or similar instruments.\nFor additional guidance on the other types of financial institutions now required to comply with AML laws and\nregulations, please refer to the !lQ!Sl[lQ[-¿þ! and\nsections.\n34.
