He warned for years that the\nbig tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than\nthey believed.\nComeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming.\nTrouble has now arrived. Unfortunately for Mr. Thiel, the storm is centered on\nFacebook, whose board he has been a member of practically since its founding. The\nsocial network, which billed itself as bringing democracy and enlightenment to the\nworld, was used by the Russians to subvert democracy and sow confusion in the\nUnited States.\nEven people paid to see the future didn’t see that one coming.\n“The board’s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term\nproblems coming around the corner,” Mr. Thiel said. “We were far from perfect in\ndoing that.”\nMr. Thiel, 50, is at the center of nearly every issue that roils Silicon Valley,\nranging from the tech elite’s fascination with New Zealand hideaways (Mr. Thiel\nobtained New Zealand citizenship) to Bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the\nproblems of herd thinking (he is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles to\nescape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the\ncreation of a media company that would outflank Breitbart and Fox for a younger\naudience).\nTwo subjects are currently overwhelming everything else: President Trump,\nwhom Mr. Thiel aggressively backed for president, and Facebook, whose core\nmission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a\ntypical Thiel move — he tends to run toward controversy even as his Silicon Valley\npeers try to make themselves inconspicuous — he agreed, in a rare interview, to\ntalk about both.\n“It’s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,” Mr. Thiel said in his new\nMidtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally\nlooks down on Trump Tower.\nDespite the proximity, the mutual enthusiasm between Mr. Thiel and Mr.\nTrump seems to have cooled. After Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National\nConvention in 2016, there were unsourced media reports that said Mr. Trump\nwanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare.\nThe investor said he had last spoken to the president “a few months ago.”\n“We don’t talk that often,” he said, but added, “I can get access anytime I\nwant.”\nThe Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a\ncandidate who would “end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,” move\nus past “fake culture wars” and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space\nprogram. That does not seem to be the president he got.\n“There are all these ways that things have fallen short,” Mr. Thiel said. But he\nsaid he had no regrets about his endorsement. “It’s still better than Hillary Clinton\nor the Republican zombies,” he said, referring to the other candidates.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as\nif in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged,” the bible of\nthe movement. A gift, he said.\nA lesser-known but possibly deeper influence was the French philosopher\nRené Girard, who taught at Stanford University when Mr. Thiel was an\nundergraduate there. For 15 years, on and off, Mr. Thiel sat in on a study group\nabout Mr. Girard’s ideas. Mr. Girard believed human beings were deeply mimetic,\nwhich is to say they copy one another.\n“It’s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,”\nMr. Thiel said. “Our desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the\nsociety around us.”\nIt was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook — where\npeople could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to\n— when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10\npercent of the company for $500,000.\nHe sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months\nago, with Facebook’s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of\nwhat he had left.\nLast summer, there was a flap when a memo by a fellow board member, Reed\nHastings, the chief executive of Netflix, appeared in The New York Times. In the\nmemo, Mr. Hastings wrote to Mr. Thiel that he displayed “catastrophically bad\njudgment” in supporting Mr. Trump.\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, did not ask him to step down\nfrom the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr.\nThiel said, noting that among other things that he brings “ideological diversity.” He\ndeclined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was\noffering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow\nto wake up to what the Russians did.\n“Remember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said\nthat was crazy — ‘How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?’\nThat was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,” he said. “They\ndid not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable\nmistake.” Facebook declined to comment.\nThe anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about\nRussia specifically and more about tech arrogance — its failure to do so much for\nso many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.\n“The Trump campaign slogan, ‘Make America Great Again,’ was perhaps the\nsingle most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,” he said. “Silicon Valley\nsays the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you\nwill.”\nA friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of\nCalifornia this year. Mr. Thiel’s advice was that he had better have a good answer\nto this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The\nanswer, he cautioned, couldn’t be a banality, such as “it’s making us more\nconnected,” and it couldn’t be utopian, such as “it’s going to cure all diseases.”\n“He wasn’t able to come up with an answer, and I couldn’t come up with one,\neither,” Mr. Thiel said. He declined to identify the friend, but it is well known in\ntech circles that Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the prominent startup\naccelerator, was thinking about running. Mr. Altman confirmed it was him and\nsaid he had decided not to run “for many reasons.”\nThere is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel’s living room, and it\nmight as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.\n“Having some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing\nfor a company,” he said. “But there is some point where it gets crazy and selfdelusional.”\nHe added that the companies “are probably in some trouble — maybe\nit’s a little, maybe it’s a lot.” The prospect of government regulation looms.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Mr. Thiel gave $300,000 to Josh Hawley, who was\ncampaigning to become Missouri’s attorney general. Mr. Hawley won, and in\nNovember he opened an antitrust investigation of Google. A spokeswoman for Mr.\nHawley, a Republican who is now challenging the state’s Democratic senator,\nClaire McCaskill, said there was “no connection” between Mr. Thiel’s donation and\nthe investigation. Google declined to comment.\nThe news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los\nAngeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech\nbubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.\n“Network effects are very positive things, but there’s a tipping point where\nthey fall over into the madness of crowds,” he said.\nAnother of Mr. Thiel’s contentious ideas was destroying Gawker, the online\npublisher. He secretly financed the privacy lawsuit that Hulk Hogan, the former\npro wrestler, filed against the media company, which Mr. Hogan won. That led to\nGawker’s bankruptcy in 2016.\nA news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley\nshould have been to Mr. Thiel’s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is\nconsistent here.\n“Gawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,” he said.\n“The ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong\nideas and then be able to correct them — these notions were powerfully undercut\nby Gawker.”\nMr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has\nprompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet\nas a final victory.\nHe denied this. “Terry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money\nfrom the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,” he said. “I don’t want\nthe archives. I don’t think it makes sense to destroy them. Preserve them, study\nthem instead.”\nFollow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld.\n4\n© 2018 ARTICLES The REMAINING New York Times Company\nSEE MY OPTIONS\nSubscriber login\n"
