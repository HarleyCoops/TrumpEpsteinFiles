Pritzker, whose family founded the Hyatt hotel chain, \nis worth about $1.5 billion. So it's easy to see how a few million — or 80 — could go missing. \nMaybe she left it in the other purse? \nA spokeswoman told Bloomberg that the $80 million was \"a substantial amount\" and that Pritzker's advisers \ncorrected the error as soon as they realized it. \nPer Bloomberg: \"Documents released last week show Pritzker received $32.2 million for a decade's worth of \nconsulting on the restructuring of domestic trusts,\" but new filings indicated she made at least $80 million more \nthan that. \nMonice M.
