When i asked a reporter from one if the leading newspapers why the \nother paper had run his opinion about my casr when he knows nothing about it, she said his p.r. people email \nand others regularly with comments on all sorts if cases just hoping to get black's name in the paper in some \npseudo authoritative role. Pretty weak. \nGood luck, David \nSent from AOL Mobile Mail \nGet the new AOL app: mail.mobile.aol.com \nFrom: David Schoen < \nDate: Friday, August 12, 2016 \nSubject: Obama team nixed fundraiser by  attorney for sex offender pal of Bill Clinton, emails show \nTo: David Schoen < \nI thought you might be interested in this article: \nOne of America's top defense attorneys was deemed too controversial to host an event for President Obama, \naccording to newly surfaced emails, mainly because of one particular client — a jet-setting billionaire accused of \ntrafficking underage girls, who also happens to be close friends with Bill Clinton. \nhttp://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/08/12/obama-team-nixed-fundraiser-by-attorney-for-sex-offender-pal-\nbill-clinton-emails-show.html  \nSent via the Fox News app for Android.
