EDWARDS, and CASE NO. CACE 15-000072\nPAUL G. CASSELL,\nv.\nPlaintiffs,\nALAN DERSHOWITZ,\nDefendant.\n/\nRESPONSE TO DEFENDANT ALAN DERSHOWITZ’S MOTION FOR\nCLARIFICATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY ORDER OR RELIEF FROM THAT ORDER\nNon-Party Virginia Giuffre, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby responds to\nDefendant Alan Dershowitz’s Motion for Clarification of Confidentiality Order or Relief From\nthat Order and states as follows:\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nOn November 12, 2015 this Court issued an Order granting in part, non-party Virginia\nGiuffre’s Motion to Quash the subpoena served by Defendant Alan Dershowitz and ordered\nprotective limits relating to her deposition. See Exhibit A, November 12, 2015 Order. On\nDecember 18, 2016, this Court entered a Confidentiality Order holding that non-party Virginia\nGiuffre’s deposition would be confidential. See Exhibit B, December 18, 2015 Confidentiality\nOrder. On January 16, 2016, Ms. Giuffre testified at her deposition in accordance with this\nCourt’s Order. The deposition was labelled confidential in accordance with this Court’s Order.\nAs the Court knows, Ms. Giuffre was a victim of sexual trafficking when she was a minor child.\nIndeed, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida has specifically recognized\nher as a “victim” of federal sex offenses. Unsurprisingly, her deposition contains highly sensitive\ninformation about her experiences as a minor child, including detail descriptions of sexual crimes\ncommitted against her.\nARGUMENT\n1. Non-Party Virginia Giuffre Agrees That Her Deposition Should Be Provided\nConfidentially To Law Enforcement to Investigate All The Crimes Committed\nAgainst Her\nDefendant Dershowitz seeks to have the Court grant an exception to the confidential nature\nof the deposition so that it can be provided to the Office of the State Attorney and the Office of the\nUnited States Attorney for investigative purposes. Specifically, Defendant Dershowitz states in\nhis motion that he is hoping to have law enforcement investigate whether Ms. Giuffre committed\nperjury by stating in her previously filed affidavit that it is her recollection that she witnessed\nformer President Bill Clinton on Jeffrey Epstein’s island in the United States Virgin Islands\n(“USVI”) 1 .\nSetting aside Defendant Dershowitz’s baseless claims of perjury, Ms. Giuffre agrees that\nher confidential deposition should be provided to law enforcement, including the United States\nAttorney and the State Attorney in each jurisdiction where any alleged crimes occurred so that\nthey may investigate all of the crimes committed against her when she was a minor child. To\nensure that justice is served and that Defendant Dershowitz’s request is not just another charade\ndesigned only to bully a sexual abuse victim, Ms. Giuffre asks the Court to impose the following\nreasonable conditions relating to the disclosure:\n�\nMr. Dershowitz agrees and is directed to cooperate with authorities and answer all\nquestions relating to the investigation of crimes against Ms. Giuffre.\n1 Defendant Dershowitz conveniently ignores that publicly available flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein’s private\nplanes demonstrate that President Clinton travelled with Jeffrey Epstein and others to various locations\nthroughout the world including Europe, Africa and Asia. See Exhibit C, Excerpts of Flight Logs from\nJeffrey Epstein’s private plane.\n2\n�\n�\n�\n�\nMr. Dershowitz agrees to make his client, Jeffrey Epstein, and others with relevant\ntestimony and with whom he has testified he shares a “common interest” – at least Epstein\nand Maxwell – available to any law enforcement agency reviewing any alleged criminal\nactivities; or in the alternative, to attest to this Court that those necessary witnesses have\nconsented to full cooperation in the investigation Mr. Dershowitz is seeking permission to\ninitiate.\nMr. Dershowitz agrees to waive the statute of limitations in all jurisdictions for any\ncriminal conduct he participated in or was aware of relating to Ms. Giuffre so that law\nenforcement can pursue any necessary charges. Defendant Dershowitz proclaimed that he\nwas willing to waive any statute of limitation for criminal conduct so this should not be an\nissue. See Exhibit D, January 12, 2016 Deposition Transcript of Alan Dershowitz at 395.\n“I had talked about the statute of limitations for criminal purpose was what I said, that I\nwould waive the statute of limitations for criminal purposes.”\nMr. Dershowitz agrees to provide the names and contact information for each State\nAttorney and United States Attorney for which he has or is planning to provide\ninformation relating to Ms. Giuffre; and agrees to jointly, with Ms. Giuffre’s counsel,\nrequest that the State Attorney and United States Attorney, in the relevant jurisdictions,\ninvestigate all potential criminal conduct. Both parties may provide any relevant\ninformation they have that may assist the authorities with their investigation.\nFor all other purposes non-party Ms. Giuffre’s January 16, 2016 deposition transcript shall\nremain confidential and sealed other than for confidential disclosure to law enforcement as\ndescribed above.\n2. Mr. Dershowitz Has No “Evidence” of Perjury And Instead Is Simply Trying To\nBully This Victim\nAs explained above, Defendant Dershowitz wrongly suggests to this Court that non-party\nVirginia Giuffre has committed perjury in an effort to taint the Court against this victim. His only\n“evidence” of this alleged perjury is a self-serving opinion from his retained expert that an\n“absence of records” in response to a FOIA request, establishes that former President Clinton was\nnever on Jeffrey Epstein’s island in the USVI. Defendant Dershowitz misrepresents the\ngovernment’s response. The government is only required to conduct a reasonable search of\nreadily accessible records. Accordingly, an “absence of records” response does not mean that\nrecords do not exist. It simply means that in the course of the search, no records were found. See\nCunningham v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 961 F.Supp. 2d 226, 236 (D.C. 2013) (court reasoning that\n“[t]he adequacy of a search is measured by a standard of reasonableness… The question is not\n3\nwhether other responsive records may exist, but whether the search was adequate.”); Wilbur v.\nC.I.A., 355 F.3d 675, 678 (D.C. 2004) (court explaining that “the agency’s failure to turn up a\nparticular document, or mere speculation that as yet uncovered documents might exist, does not\nundermine the determination that the agency conducted an adequate search for the requested\nrecords.”). Moreover, when dealing with a former President’s security detail travel, there are a\nnumber of reasons why the government may not disclose those records.\nAs explained above, public flight records from Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane show that\nPresident Clinton traveled with Jeffrey Epstein on multiple occasions. Nevertheless, if Defendant\nDershowitz wants to pursue this issue before the Court, then he needs to produce for deposition\ntestimony in this case and the proposed criminal investigation, the other witnesses that were\npresent on the island at the time former President Clinton was alleged to have visited, including\nhis client Jeffrey Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell, to whom he has testified he is party to a joint\ndefense agreement. It is worth noting on that point, that despite Mr. Epstein’s counsel’s\nattendance at depositions in this case, and Defendant Dershowitz’s claim that Mr. Epstein is still\nhis client, Mr. Epstein has taken extreme measures to avoid being deposed in this case despite\nbeing ordered to deposition by this Court.\nIndeed, it is also noteworthy that during Defendant Dershowitz’s recent deposition,\ncounsel for Mr. Edwards and Mr. Cassell asked Defendant Dershowitz the following question:\n“Was Virginia Roberts lying when she said Jeffrey Epstein socialized with Bill Clinton during the\nrelevant time period?” Depo Tr. Of Alan Dershowitz, Vol. 4, January 12, 2016 at 511. Before\nDefendant Dershowitz could answer, Mr. Dershowitz’s legal counsel interposed an attorney-client\nprivilege objection. Id. Perhaps Mr. Epstein’s defense counsel can provide to the Court an\nappropriate privilege log regarding that objection – and all the communications between Mr.\nEpstein and Defendant Dershowitz that would have been revealed in answer to that question – so\nthat the Court will have the benefit of a full record in ruling on this motion.\n4\nCONCLUSION\nWHEREFORE, Non-Party Virginia Giuffre respectfully requests that this Court allow a\nlimited release of her confidential deposition transcript to law enforcement subject to the terms set\nforth above on pages 2-3.\nDated: February 8, 2016\nRespectfully submitted,\nBOIES, SCHILLER & FLEXNER LLP\n401 East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 1200\nFort Lauderdale, Florida 33301\nTelephone: (954) 356-0011\nFacsimile: (954) 356-0022\nBy: /s/Sigrid S.
