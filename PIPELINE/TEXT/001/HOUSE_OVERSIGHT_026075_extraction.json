Cannot open the NYT article. But to judge from the article's title they are at least \nexaggerating if not totally wrong. This attack will not change strategy in a major way on either side. It will \nhowever raise respect for DJT in Moscow and few other capitals. That's not necessarily bad, if the WH won't \nread this change as a precedent which calls to be repeated too often. \nBest \nEB \nSent from my iPhone \nOn 14 Apr 2017, at 16:06, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nhttps://www.nytimes com/2017/04/13/theater/o s lo-bro adway-review. html?mo dule=WatchingP ortal&region=c-\ncolumn-middle-span-\nregion&p gTyp e=Homep age &action= cli ck&mediaId=thumb square& state=standard&contentP lacement=6&ver \nsion=internal&contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F20  \n17%2F04%2F13%2Ftheater%2Foslo-broadway-review.html&eventName=Watching-article-click  \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
