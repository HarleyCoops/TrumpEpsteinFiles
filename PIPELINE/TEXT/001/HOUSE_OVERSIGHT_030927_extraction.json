Buschel \nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Sam Fields on 302 Interview \nBroward Probe: 302 Reasons Not To Talk To The FBI \nBY SAM FIELDS \nGuest Columnist \nActually, there are not 302 reasons. There is but one and it is called in federal court \"\"The 302\". It \ncould screw the innocent and the unwary. \nThe newspapers and Browardbeat.com make clear that the Federal investigations that led to the arrests \nof County Commissioner Josephus Eggleston, former Miramar Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman and \nSchool Board member Bev Gallagher are just beginning. \nThe FBI will be interviewing everyone from County Administrator Bertha Henry to bus drivers about \nanything and everything. \nThey are looking for scalps. \nI suspect that if the average person thought about it, he would assume that when the FBI comes calling, \n.like Joe Friday from DRAGNET, they \"want the facts and nothing but the facts.\"\" Equally important \nthey want an accurate record of that interview so they bring a court reporter or at the very least a tape \nrecorder. \nThe average person would be wrong. \nAgents bring a pencil and pad to take notes. They then prepare a summary of the interview called a \n\"302 Report.\" \nIf you are called as a witness at trial, prior to testifying, you will be given a copy of \"Your 302\" to \nreview. It is a record of what the FBI insists you said at your previous meeting. \nIf your interview lasted more than thirty seconds, it is guaranteed you will fmd numerous discrepancies. \nSome of them will be insignificant; some of them could be material. \nfile:///Cl/Documents`/020and%20Settings/Trial/Desktop/E...uction/eDocs/eMail/Grant Smith080178^eMailContent.htm (1 of 5) [11/6/2010 10:16:54 PM] \n14545 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030945 \nGrant_Smith080178^eMailContent.htm \nAsk two people to listen to you in a discussion about a traffic accident and then write a summary. It is a \nguaranteed they will have differences with each other as well as with you, the witness. \nYou said, \"I am reasonably sure that the traffic light was green\"\". \nOne report takes out the equivocation and quotes you as saying: \"The light was green.\" \nThis brings us to Federal law 18 USC 1001. That statute makes it a felony to lie to the government. And \nguess who decides whether or not you were lying? The government. \nSo here is your conundrum. Do you testify about your doubts about the light, which is the truth, or do \n-----------------------------------------------you adopt the \"302\" version to avoid the wrath of the FBI? \nWhether or not the \"302\" discrepancies are a result of stupidity or cupidity makes no difference. \nTestify in opposition to the \"302\" and you are in the crosshairs of the Feds. \nIf they believe your testimony cost them the case, the next thing you likely to hear from the FBI will be: \n\"Please place your hands behind your back.\" \nA number of years ago, fed up with the 302 Two Step, I turned the tables on them. \nIn a high profile case, my client was asked to submit to an FBI interview at their offices in North Miami \nBeach. \nFeigning naivety, I asked where the court reporter was. I was told there was no court reporter. \nI then asked where the tape recorder was. \nI will always be impressed that the agent was able to give us the response he did without laughing. He \nsaid the FBI could not tape the interview because they did not have \"enough money in their budget.\" \nIt was time to play the Trump Card. \nAt that point, I removed a cassette recorder from my pocket and explained that my client had been able \nto scrape together the 59 cents for a cassette tape. Further we would pay for the tape to be transcribed \nand supply them with a free copy of everything. \nYou could've heard a fart in a vacuum. \nThey now made it clear thaf no way, no how would any FBI interview be recorded. So we went forward \nwith the interview as the agent took notes. \nMonths later the client was called to testify at trial. \nI warned him the \"\"302\" would be a work of fiction. It was. I was sitting in the back of the courtroom. \nfile:NCl/Documents%20and%20Settings/Trial/Desktop/E...uction/eDocs/eMail/Grant_Smith080178^eMailContentlatrn (2 of 5) [11/6/2010 10:16:54 P1V11 \n14546 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030946 \nGrant_S*th080178^eMailContent.htm \nCalled to the stand, he told the \"\"real\"\" truth and not the \"302\" version of the truth. The Assistant U.S. \nAttorney was frustrated and kept on confronting him with the \"302\" version. \nFed up with the prosecutor and in the presence of the jury, the witness preceded to recount my debate \nover recording from the first interview. Pointing to me in the back of the courtroom, the witness \nannounced that I had warned him that they would pull this crap with the \"302\" report. \nIt didn't take the jury very long to acquit. \nWith the advent of DNA and groups like the Innocence Project, we have now seen that so-called \nunrecorded confessions have put many innocent people in jail and even on Death Row. As a result, \nagencies such as the BSO, now require all interviews to be taped. \nBut not the FBI. \nLike anyone, including lawyers, the FBI wants to control the record of the interview. Taping hurts that \neffort. \nI'm not saying that it is FBI policy to step over the line. But they have chalk on their shoes more often \nthan you can imagine. \nSo, what's should you do if the FBI comes calling? \nFirst of all, the advice I am about to give is not for the a guy who was an inadvertent witness to a bank \nrobbery. \nI am talking about people who are being interviewed as part of the types of crimes that are best \ndescribed as corruption, RICO, white collar, etc. \nThose are the kinds of cases that involve tons of evidence. Giving an innocent, but incorrect answer to a \nvague question could leave any of us in deep CaCa. \nA case in point is the lead story in the September 26, 2009 Herald. Chris Walton, director of the \nBroward County Transportation Department, was interviewed by two FBI agents. \nHe stated that they wanted to know if \"commissioners attempted to influence contracts.\" \n\"I told them no.\" \nIt may sound like a simple straight forward Q-and-A but it ain't necessarily so. He may think his \ninterview and public statement ends the matter. \nIn actuality, he has thrown down the gauntlet in front of the FBI. \nStart out with the understanding that the FBI is not investigating to see if there is crime and corruption in \nfile:///Cl/Documents%20and%20Settings/Trial/Desktop/E,..uction/eDocs/eMail/Grant Smith080178^eMailContent.htm (3 of 5) [11/6/2010 10:16:54 PIVI] \n14547 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030947 \nGrant_Smith08017VeMai;Content.htm \nBroward County government. They already believe there is. They are only trying to uncover evidence to \nconfirm their beliefs. \nWalton's blanket defense of the Commission has made the Feds conclude he is a fool or co-conspirator. \nThe FBI just needs the evidence and not much of it. To quote the late Supreme Court Justice William \nBrennan: \"any prosecutor worth his salt could indict a ham sandwich.\"\" \nThis means all evidence, regardless of its ambiguous nature, will be interpreted to support their \nassumption of wrongdoing. \n• They will be using software to go through millions of E-mail messages to look for key words. As Buddy \nhas quoted me: \"The 'E' in E-mail stands for evidence.\"\" \nSo imagine the following scenario. \nSix months from now they uncover an E-mail from the County Manager to Walton stating that \nCommissioner X wants to know if the bid of company Y for new busses was correctly filled out. He \nreplies that it was. \nMonths later he has totally forgotten about the innocuous E-mail. Based on the merits, he happens to \nrank Y's bid number one. \nYou can bet as sure as J. Edgar Hoover wore pink poodle skirts, the FBI will conclude this was code \nfrom Commissioner X to Walton to vote for Y. \nArmed with the E-mail you can be damn sure that the G-Men will be back threatening him with \neverything including a stint in Gitmo. \nAll of this might have been avoided if he had followed my three basic rules. \nMemorize them. \nI. Do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer. \n2. Do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer. \n3. Do not talk to the FBI without a law \nGrant J.
