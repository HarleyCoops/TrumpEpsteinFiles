With it came SkyTheater\nfounder Gregg Launer, 52, a friendly bear of a\nman who tries for modesty but whose enthusiasm\nspills close to hubris when he describes\nthe custom-built entertainment package as\nbeing to the average movie experience what\nSofia Vergara is to simply being female. Launer\nis something of a likeable version of Steven\nJobs. His knowledge in the world of sound is\nsuch that he frequently stops and searches his\nvocabulary for language that the average listener\nwill understand. And frequently failing,\nhe will offer an apology and start over. In his\nown circle, he is often described by clients as\na genius. To lesser human beings, his thoughts\nseem to run like a pinball through the random\nlight and sound of an arcade game, with a purpose\ndifficult to recognize.\n“I’m a true audiophile, and what I’m\nbuilding is a sensory experience that will so\ncompletely absorb my clients that it becomes\nreality and they lose themselves in the world\nthat the director or cameraman or composer\nSkyTheater founder Gregg\nLauner put nearly 1,000\nmovies into a Global\nExpress Avod.\ncreated,” he explains. “I\nbuild every system as if it\nwere going into my own\nairplane. I want to impress\neven myself, and I’m my\nown worst critic.”\nHis earliest memories\nare of music and theater\nand lying awake in\nbed and listening to legendary\nDJ Cousin Brucie\nlay down a cascade of rock and roll on New\nYork’s powerhouse WABC. Even decades\nlater, one of his favorite toys at home is a\nRock-Ola Jukebox. “When you listen to Dean\nMartin, or Elvis, or Chuck Berry on a jukebox,\nyou’re hearing rock and roll the way it was\nmade to be heard,” he avows.\nAnd he recalls a summer when his parents\ntook him on vacation to the Deauville Beach\nResort in Miami Beach, where The Supremes\nwere performing. “They were in the room\nacross the hall from us, and Mary Wilson and\nFlo Ballard shared a cabana next to ours. I was\ntoo young to attend the show, but the resort\nmanager had mercy on me, took me by the\nhand and put me in the front row.”\nBy the age of 18, Launer held a first-class\nradiotelephone license from the FCC and by 19\nwas an audio engineer producing music tracks\nat NBC in Miami. And along the way, he also\nindulged what he describes as his alternative\npassion of flying, picking up his private license\nand going on to become a flight instructor.\nAt the age of 32, he and wife, Blanche,\nformed a company that two years later became\nPHOTOS: KIRBY J. HARRISON\nSkyTheater. And as if life had determined to\ncreate a movie script for him, Launer’s first customer\nand later friend was Alexander Zuyev,\nthe pilot who defected in spectacular manner\nfrom the former Soviet Union in 1989, at\nthe same time delivering a MiG-29 into western\nhands. “He loved America and would have\nthe most incredible Fourth of July parties. But\ninstead of beer and burgers, he would serve\nvodka and caviar. It was his belief in me that\nhelped launch SkyTheater.”\nGetting Off the Ground\nLauner’s first theater in the sky was for businessman\nand entrepreneur Wayne Huizenga\nof Blockbuster and the airplane was a BAC\n1-11. Then came a Boeing 727-200 and Launer\nwas off and running.\nIt was a time when digital technology\nwas in its infancy and the reliability was still\nin question. So Launer devised a way for all\nthe soundtracks to play through a single system\n(either 7.1 or 5.1 surround sound), with\n19-inch touchscreen, video monitor/controllers\nthroughout the cabin and two 43-inch\nplasma monitors. “Ten years later,” claims\nLauner, “that airplane was still state of the art.”\nIn the late 1990s some of those working for\nproducer/director George Lucas’ Skywalker\nRanch happened to listen to the SkyTheater\nsystem Launer had installed in the 727. He was\nimmediately recruited and spent the next two\nyears–off and on–there, working and learning.\nLauner remembers being “incredibly fortunate”\nto be part of a group that was “setting\nthe standards that still exemplify visual film\nand movie soundtracks today.”\nIn the meantime, Launer had formed a Sky-\nTheater partnership in Fort Lauderdale with\nfriend and fellow traveler Andrew Guenther,\nwho owns Advanced Audio Design, a hometheater\nfirm in Sarasota, Fla.\n“He handles a lot of the equipment and\ndesigns the electronics that make everything\nwork. Andrew does a guy’s home theater, and\nif the guy owns an airplane, SkyTheater does\nthe cabin entertainment,” says Launer.\nGuenther’s talent and influence is such,\nclaims Launer, “that high-end audiovisual electronics\nmanufacturers will often come to him\nfor his input before introducing some new\ntechnology at a major trade show.”\nAmong Guenther’s home theater customers\nare movie actor John Travolta, basketball\ncoach Pat Riley, singer Gloria Estefan “and\nmore who prefer not to be named,” he says.\nThough focused on two different theater\nmarkets, Guenther and Launer are involved\ntogether in a music project designed to\n“recruit and produce live venues for musicians\nContinues on page 28\nGoodrich Near Completion\nLast year, United Technologies\nagreed to the acquisition of Goodrich\nin a deal that called for UT to shell out\n$16.5 billion cash and assume $1.9\nbillion in assumed debt. The acquisition\nby UT was to be finalized by the end of\nlast month.\nThe acquisition would bring to UT\nGoodrich’s rapidly growing interiors\nbusiness, much of it acquired by\nGoodrich in 2010 from DeCrane Aerospace.\nGoodrich describes the seating,\ncabin management and entertainment\nsystems and cabinetry as part of its\n“total cabin capability” for everything in\nbusiness jet cabin components.\nLeather and Lace\nComes from Edelman\nEdelman Leather has introduced a new\nLeather & Lace line, inspired by the work\nof artists from the studios of Belgium,\nHungary and Slovakia and transferred\nthrough the use of laser etching and\ncutting technology.\nInspired by the die-cut felt work of Jasper\nMorrison, the Dutch designers have\nintroduced to the Moooi, Broog and Vitra\nEdelman’s new Leather & Lace line is a\nnew play on age-old craftsmanship from\nBelgium, Hungary and Slovakia.\nlines hauntingly elegant chandeliers by\nDiller Scofidio & Renfro for Swarovski,\nand the collections of Prada, McQueen,\nLouis and Lanvin.\nEdelman’s artists describe the results\nof this new line on its Cavallini hair-on\nhides as “chic and fun.” Other leathers\nappropriate for the Leather & Lace\ndesigns include Napoli and Royal Suede.\nMetrica Aviation Makes\nMove at Nuremberg Airport\nMaintenance, repair and overhaul\nspecialist Aero-Dienst, in the process\nof increasing its usable space at\nGermany’s Nuremberg Airport with\nanother hangar, has added 27,000 sq\nft and considerable refurbishment\nexpertise through a partnership with\nMetrica Aviation Interior.\n“We are now able to offer an\noperator interior repair and refurbishment\nsimultaneous with other\nmaintenance, all under one roof,” said\nAero-Dienst managing director Martin\nBauer. The two companies began\nworking together in January this year\nand Metrica has already completed\nseveral refurbishments.\nMetrica is an established business, a\nsubsidiary of Qatar’s Ghanim bin Saad al\nSaad and Sons Group Holdings.\nContinues on page 28\n26 Aviation International News • July 2012 • www.ainonline.com\nContinued from page 26\ncompletions\n& refurbs\nEichten said Pats did a nine-year\nmaintenance check on a BBJ last year\nand included a major refurbishment\nat the same time. The center has also\nsent out “quite a number of bids” on\nBBJs due for the 12-year maintenance\ncheck, and all include “substantial\nrefurbishment work.”\nKing Aerospace is looking toward\nthe bizliner business for a boost. “We’re\nin discussions now with international\ncustomers for executive conversions\nand even a green airplane completion,”\nsaid Jerry King. “And they’re all\nwidebodies.”\nAccording to David Edinger, CEO at\nComlux America in Indianapolis, many\nof the early Airbus A319s and Boeing\nBusiness Jets have had minimal cabin\nA technician in the Goodrich interior paint shop in\nWichita applies finish to a piece of cabin cabinetry.\nupgrades since they entered service some\n12 years ago, and the cabin electronics are\npractically antique.\nEdinger said Comlux America, part\nof The Comlux Group in Switzerland, is\n“really starting to roll.”\nHe told AIN the first green airplane\nhas been delivered–an ACJ319–and it\ncame in 1,000 pounds below the completion\nallowance weight. It also tested with\nan average cabin noise level of 48 dB(SIL),\n“about what you might expect in a suburban\nliving room, and it was under the\nprojected noise level by 3 dB(SIL).”\nCurrently undergoing refurbishment\nis a Boeing 757 and a pair of Airbus\nACJs. In the second quarter this year,\na BBJ to be outfitted for Hyundai was\nscheduled to roll into the Comlux hangar.\nComlux America is approved by\nboth Airbus and Boeing for interior\noutfitting. “We want to focus on BBJs\nand ACJs and do this segment well and\non time,” said The Comlux Group president\nRichard Gaona.\nLufthansa Technik in Hamburg, Germany,\nis working on a Boeing 767 executive\ninterior and is looking for two 747-8s\nto roll in by year-end.\nWalter Heerdt, Lufthansa’s senior\nv-p of marketing and sales, expects the\nContinues on page 30\nSkyTheater | Continued from preceding page\nin unique multi-channel surround-sound, as\nwell as to promote them to the film and television\nindustries for soundtrack recordings.”\nIn 2007, “an executive closely associated\nwith the Internet industry came to Launer\nwith his new Global Express XRS, and made it\nclear that what he wanted was far beyond anything\noff-the-shelf.” In 2008 the airplane was\ndelivered with a complete and custom-built\nSkyTheater that includes:\n• 1080p high-bandwidth wiring throughout\n• monitors and speakers\n• audiovisual on-demand (Avod) with a library\nof more than 1,000 movies.\n• a SkyTheater app to allow passengers to\nuse personal iPhones and iPads to control all\naspects of the entertainment system.\n• a customized touch-screen control package.\n“The owner can also customize the sound\nbalance in the cabin by simply going through\nthe field until he finds a ‘flavor’ he likes,”\nexplains Launer. “In this particular airplane,”\nsays Launer, “SkyTheater is pre-tuned for the\nowner’s personal tastes to reproduce audio\nidentical to what he would hear in the Hollywood\nBowl or Lincoln Center or some other\npopular venue.”\nTotally Absorbed in the Moment\nPutting SkyTheater through its paces on\nthe Global, Launer selects surround sound and\nasks visitors to walk through the entire cabin,\nto sit anywhere they like, even lie on the floor\nand note any change in the audio. His grin\nbroadens as not one individual professes to\ndetect a difference.\nLauner goes on to select Star Wars Episode\nVI: Return of the Jedi, picking the scene of the\nchase on Ewok speeder bikes through the forest\nof Endor. “Now listen closely,” he advises.\nAs the action roars across the screen, it is perfectly\npaced by the sound in that reality, “and\nif I hadn’t told you to listen, you would have\nbeen totally absorbed by the experience without\nrealizing why.\n“What I aim for is not only a perfect audio\nsystem, but one that is perfectly synchronized\nwith the film,” he says.\nBut is it high-definition? Launer expresses\nmock surprise at the question. Then he admits\nthat not everything in the Global’s film bank\nis HD; however, he also points out that with\nthe technology to tune the system properly,\neven a pre-digital recording will be rendered\nin sufficient high definition as to be almost\nunrecognizable as anything else. And he also\nA private lavatory in a narrow-body bizliner features\nliberal use of dark veneer and a marble countertop.\nexplains that simply having a Blu-ray player or\nAvod and an HD monitor does not ensure an\nHD experience. “You have to have the bandwidth\nto carry the signal that will allow 1080p\nbetween the origin and the final destination.”\nWhile the system in the Global Express\nXRS is now almost four years old, and\nSkyTheater has since done several more airplanes,\nincluding Donald Trump’s recently\ncompleted Boeing 757, the entertainment\npackage in the XRS remains, he claims,\n“years ahead of anything else.”\nWarren Justice, chief pilot on the Global,\nchuckles when he remembers his first meeting\nwith Launer, “a big guy dressed like a biker and\nwearing a black beret. But he knew what he\nwas talking about and no one in this company\nhas regretted listening,” Justice continues.\n“I’ve never heard anything like what he put\ninto this airplane. Even after it was installed,\nhe insisted on going with us on a flight test to\ntune the sound for cruise at 41,000 feet. He\npersonally programmed the individual controls.\nIt was so well thought out that the owner\nwent right into it on the first day and didn’t\nneed a single lesson.”\nSince installation, the airplane has been all\nover the world and not a single component of\nthe entertainment system has needed to be\nchanged, said Justice. However, he adds, on\nseveral occasions, when the airplane was passing\nthrough Florida with a stop-over, Launer\nhas insisted on coming out to see if the system\nwas still properly tuned.\nThe system is not inexpensive, allows Justice.\nJust a little north of a million dollars. But\nhe adds, “If this is what you want, you’ll definitely\nget what you pay for. I don’t know how\nwe could have done any better.”\nTheo Kalomirakis, president of Theo Kalomirakis\nTheaters of Brooklyn, N.Y., is one of\nthe foremost designers of home theaters in\nthe world and has consistently turned down\nrequests to do an in-flight theater. “I have\nbeen skeptical of the ability of anyone to control\nsound in such an environment,” he told\nAIN. “What Gregg designed and built on that\nGlobal Express is the first serious system I’ve\nheard. Gregg has tamed the beast.”\nBut it isn’t just a matter of being good\nat what you do, says Launer. “It’s a matter\nof passion, and of loving what you do. Think of\nSkyTheater as a personal transporter [a la Star\nTrek]. You step into it in New York City and you\nstep out of it in Los Angeles, and everything in\nbetween was just a moment in time.” –K.J.H.\nIacobucci Shines at EBACE\nIacobucci HF appeared at EBACE with\na new espresso maker for the business\njet galley and a galley cart that doesn’t\nlook out of place on a large private jet.\nThe 28V espresso machine does not\nwork with the usual boiler but with\npatented heat exchangers to ensure\ninstant and continuous operation without\nwaiting for the water to reheat\nafter each use. In addition, the heat\nexchanger makes for a much lighter\nmachine, and its “open system” allows\nthe use of all easy-serve espresso pods.\nThe serving cart, created by\nDesignworksUSA, features attachable\n“skins” or even transparent windows to\nallow passengers to see available items. For\nuse in a private jet, the top surface can be\nmodified for a more formal appearance.\n“We brought the style, fit and finish\nthat customers expect to find in premium\nenvironments at home to enhance\ntheir on-board experience,” said Laurenz\nSchaffer, president of BMW Group\nDesignworksUSA.\nAn espresso maker and an executive galley cart\nare two new items from Italy’s lacobucci HF.\nAirGlide Coatings Cut Fuel Burn\nAviation marketing consultancy Action\nAviation has signed an exclusive distribution\nagreement with AirGlide, a UK\ncompany that claims that its new Aviation\nShield nano-technology coating can\nresult in fuel-burn savings of about 4\npercent through a drag reduction of up\nto 40 percent.\nAccording to Action Aviation’s website,\nan ACJ318 on a two-hour flight\nmight burn 9,500 pounds of fuel. With\nthe AirGlide coating, the same aircraft\nwould burn 200 pounds less fuel over\nthat same route.\nOther advantages include reducing the\ncarbon footprint, reducing cleaning and\nmaintenance costs and greater protection\nagainst corrosion and erosion. It\nalso means, the company claims, that\nthe exterior paint will last longer.\nAkzoNobel Wins\nAirbus Approval\nAkzoNobel Aerospace Coatings of the\nNetherlands has received approval of its\nAerobase base coat and Aviox UVR clearcoat\nsystem from Airbus as an option.\nThe system allows selective removal\nof only the base coat/clear coat in\npreparation for repainting, leaving\nthe original primer intact and thereby\nsaving the aircraft owner time and\nmoney, according to the Amsterdambased\ncompany.\nFurther, AkzoNobel said the system\n“was developed in line with one of Airbus’s\nkey objectives to produce aircraft\nthat are friendlier to the environment\nand more eco-efficient.” The base coat/\nclear coat system is ready for use in\nseries production.\nContinues on page 30\n28 Aviation International News • July 2012 • www.ainonline.com\n"
