Thought it would amuse you. Tell me what you \nthink of it. \nxoxo Peggy \nHD: Wall Street, Take Two \nDEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back \nto business. Peggy Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her \nfamous friends. Nice work if you can get it. \nIn 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for \"Platoon,\" he immediately turned to a \ndomestic arena and began working on \"Wall Street\" in New York City where his father had been a \nstockbroker. Although the film was widely seen as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has \nsaid that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of finance (as seen through the Hal \nHolbrook character) and an homage to his father. \nAt the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers \nfrom his earlier \"Scarface\" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both \ngroups had an animalistic need to obtain big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and \ngreed. \nOliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud \nFox, a kid from nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust \ninto the fast lane with a rock star financial mentor who teaches him corruption. \nOliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. \nMichael was not known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver \nalso saw the anger, confidence, salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko \nlooked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's \nmost important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one could ever forget. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021235 \nWhen Gekko delivers his speech, \"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works,\" \ncinematic history was made. \n\"Wall Street\" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire \nfinancial services industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. \nFour years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film \nEntertainment co-chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board \npending script approval. Steven Schiff wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered \nit obsolete. \nAlan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the \nsocial rhythms of New York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko's character was modeled after '70s junk \nbond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new \nvillain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike Novogratz, geniuses who have created \nstratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to direct, he rewrote a \nportion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. \nThis past September, Oliver yelled, \"action\" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he \nemerges from a lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to \nredefine himself in a different era. The New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers \nimmediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. \nA week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver \ndesigns an elaborate tracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake \nMoore, a young idealistic investment banker played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, \nMoore's fiancée, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an off-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver \nplayed Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gekko, who \nused to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. \nThe shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In \none take Michael makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on \nthe set is courteous but quick and tense. There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. \nI watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers' canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff \n(\"Monsters Ball\") and Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first \"Wall Street.\" They have asked \nme to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. \nOliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture gowns. \"Give me the night before the \nTitanic goes down,\" were his exact words. Not a problem. \nI pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his \npersonal publicist when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for \"Wall Street\" and we have \nremained great friends. Gekko is just as challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of \ntechnical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' Broadway debut in a \"Little Night Music.\" \nMichael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts received for \ntheir shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021236 \nI tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him \nand the production. \n8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on \n65th Street and Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My \nhair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white \nValentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial titan husband David is unaware where she is this \nmorning. \nVanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage \nGeoffrey Beene, and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow \nfake flower on his lapel. Costume Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the \nfirst film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. \nOliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's \"W\"). His character Bretton (never Bret) \nJames, a ruthless Wall Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano \nrecital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building \nactually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the \n'60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and replaced with matching \nphotographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's \nvision. \nAt 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, \nand her friend Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. \nProduction assistants fuss over them. Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, \nand I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to \nthe director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, Hamish and decorator Geoffrey \nBradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. \nOliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the \nscene, gives out lines to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that \nmy earrings are too small. Wardrobe jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, \"Action.\" The kid plays \nthe piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines \nand Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours later a PA yells, \"Lunch\". \nIn costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet \"The Harpies,\" including Liz \nSmith, Barbara Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. \nGraydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in \"Wall Street 2\" as an extra. (I make \nthis up.) Graydon jokes that he only works with lines. I say, \"Not a problem.\" (This will be news to Oliver.) \nBack on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. \nOliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard \nDon Marron saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie \nMulligan hangs out watching boyfriend Shia work. \nAt sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. \n(He loves it.) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021237 \nChuck Pfieffer plants a \"Page Six\" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. \nThursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street \nOliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate \nChinese dinner. Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of \ncalls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and \nGraydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. \nMonday, November 9, 25 Broadway \nOne hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of \ndawn for the Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. \nSusan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding \narea where we join Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, \nsongstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in \nsee-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld \nDrake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia Taylor and Italian \nnewsman Mario Calvo-Platero. \nEllen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer \ngowns and work at break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. \nEllen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-\nup artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are alternately filled with steaming coffee, \nfattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of excitement. \nWe are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie \nSheen stand-ins. Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He \nis now the highest paid television actor commanding two million dollars an episode of \"Two and a Half Men.\" \nOliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to \nthe camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight \nlines challenging their concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, \"Action\" as the extras aggressively \njockey for face time. Charlie is not having an easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband \nChuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and my marriage has become a threesome. \nSensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a \ndinner table with Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-\nPlatero. He directs us to chat with each other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. \nElsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old \nEli Wallach and Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who \nthrows himself in front of a train early in the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia \nMiles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international \nbanker. \nLunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021238 \nSusan, Jill and me to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, \nschools, country houses and vacations. \nBack on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live \nmusic. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, \nwatches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old \nfather, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his \nhero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes. \nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is \nclose to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner \nfor artists uptown. \nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of \nthe shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman, \nWilliam advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot \ncontinues for numerous takes following Josh and NoeIle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom \nwith one-line greetings. \nAt last, \"It's a wrap\" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of \nelectrifying glamour,\" and \"the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.\" \nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting \nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet \nfrom Teterboro with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in \nSeptember, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to dinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they \ncould observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment. \nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial \ncomeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. \nThe camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite \nsuit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about \nthe money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\" like his famous \ndo. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.\" \nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across \nthe street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. \nMichael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan \nsplendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver \nStone's surprise endings. \nTwentieth Century Fox releases \"Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps\" on April 23rd and it's got hit written \nall over it. \n--\n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021239 \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
