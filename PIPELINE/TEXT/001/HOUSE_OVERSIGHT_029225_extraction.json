    "full_text": "From: jeffrey E. [jeevacation@gmail.com] \nSent: 2/10/2015 5:22:52 PM \nTo: Mortimer Zuckerman \nSubject: time to publish this instead ofthe trite. \nore \n15 of 141,013 \nFwd: Statement for Press \nFrom: Carolyn Cohen \nDate: February 10, 2015 at 10:40:57 AM EST \nTo: Alan Dershowitz ______________________ \nSubject: Statement for Press \nAlan Dershowitz's Statement: We can now prove that Jane Doe #3 has no credibility and lied  \nabout Clinton, the Gores and Dershowitz.  \nDershowitz's lawyers have filed a detailed reply to Jane Doe #3 false charges. In it they definitively \nrespond to all of the alleged evidence presented by Jane Doe #3 and her lawyers. Since that filing Mr. \nDershowitz's lawyers have uncovered additional evidence that Jane Doe #3 has lied about her \nalleged contacts with fonner President Clinton and former Vice President Gore and the then Mrs. \nGore. In her first affidavit to the court she repeats the claim that she had earlier sold to a British \ntabloid: namely that \"former President Bill Clinton was present on the island [Jeffrey Epstein's \nprivate island] at a time when [Jane Doe #3] was also present on the Island.\" \nThis statement, sworn under oath, summarizes a far more elaborate fantasy that she sold to a British \ntabloid which has since been repeated by the international media. In neither statement, does she \nprovide any specific dates or times, but she does weave an imaginative fantasy about her fictional \nmeeting with former President Clinton. She \"describes\" how Mr. Clinton's Secret Service detail \nallowed Ghislaine Maxwell, then a novice helicopter pilot, to fly the former President to Epstein's \nprivate island on a large black helicopter — an obvious lie. She then purports to \"describe\" specific \nseating locations at a fictional dinner party that included her, Mr. Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein and two \nother underage \"olive-skinned brunettes\" whose identities she could not provide: \n\"I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black \nhelicopter that Jeffrey had bought her. She'd always wanted to fly and Jeffrey paid for her to take \nlessons, and I remember she was very excited because she got her licence around the first year we \nmet. I used to get frightened flying with her but Bill had the Secret Service with him and I remember \nhim talking about what a good job she did. I only ever met Bill twice but Jeffrey had told me that \nthey were good friends. I asked, \"How come?\" and he laughed and said, \"He owes me some \nfavours.\" Maybe he was just joking but it constantly surprised me that people with as much to lose as \nBill and [Prince] Andrew weren't more careful. She said that when dining that night, Maxwell sat at \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029225 \nPresident Clinton's left, while they were joined by two 'olive-skinned brunettes' who had been flown \nin from New York... \nI'd never met them before. I'd say they were no older than 17, very innocent-looking. \nThey weren't there for me. They weren't there for Jeffrey or Ghislaine because I was there to have sex \nwith Jeffrey on the trip. \nMaybe Jeffrey thought they would entertain Bill, but I saw no evidence that he was interested in \nthem. He and Jeffrey and Ghislaine seemed to have a very good relationship. Bill was very funny. \nHe made me laugh a few times. And he and Jeffrey and Ghislaine told blokey jokes and the brunettes \nlistened politely and giggled. \nAfter dinner I gave Jeffrey an erotic massage. I don't remember seeing Bill again on the trip but I \nassume Ghislaine flew him back...\" \nJane Doe #3 also concocted another meeting with a powerful political figure for the British tabloid, \nthis time claiming to have met former Vice President Gore and his then wife, Tipper, on the same \nIsland, again providing no specific dates or times, but only personal interest details designed to \nenhance the value of her fictional account \n\"[Jane Doe #3} disclosed that Mr Clinton's vice-president Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, were also \nguests of Epstein on his island... 'I had no clue that anything was up,' [Jane Doe #3] says. 'The Gores \nseemed like a beautiful couple when I met them. All I knew was that Mr Gore was a friend of \nJeffrey's and Ghislaine's. Jeffrey didn't ask me to give him a massage... There might have been a \ncouple of other girls there on that trip but I could never have imagined this guy would do anything \nwrong. I was planning to vote for him when I turned 18. I thought he was awesome.\" \nThese fabrications, which are obvious on their face, could easily have been determined to be false by \nany reasonable investigation. Our investigation has turned up evidence that Mr. Clinton was never \non Mr. Epstein's island, that neither Mr. Gore, nor his former wife, have ever been on the island, and \nthat Mr. and Mrs. Gore do not even know Mr. Epstein. Jane Doe #3's salaciously detailed accounts, \nsold for money to a tabloid are made up and were purposely designed to titillate the interests of \nreaders eager for such salacious material. Jane Doe #3's even more salacious \"descriptions\" of her \nalleged sexual encounters with Dershowitz are also fabricated. \nIf it turns out that Jane Doe #3 deliberately lied about seeing former President Clinton on the island, \nshe would be guilty of perjury. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029226 \nMr. Dershowitz's legal team has uncovered additional evidence, which it is in the process of \nverifying, that proves a pattern of lying and false accusations that casts even further doubt on Jane \nDoe #3's credibility. This evidence will be disclosed once it has been confirmed by their \ninvestigation. \nWeb Clip \nESPN.com - Sources: \nSherman avoids  \nsurgery, for now - 25 \nminutes ago \nInbox \nx \n11:46 AM (1 hour ago) \nAlan Dershowitz \nto Darren, me, Martin \nEl \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
