When journalists asked questions about this\nnew agency, Washington officials jokingly told them that the initials\nNSA stood for “No Such Agency.” The reason for this extraordinary\nstealth is that the NSA is involved in a very sensitive enterprise.\nIts job is to intercept, decode, and analyze foreign electronic communications\ntransmitted around the globe over copper wires, fiberoptic\ncable, satellite, microwave relays, cell phone towers, wireless\ntransmissions, and the Internet for specified intelligence purposes. In\nintelligence jargon, its product is called COMINT, which stands for\ncommunications intelligence. Because this form of intelligence gathering\nis most effective when the NSA’s targets are unaware of the\nstate- of- the- art tools the NSA uses to break into their computers\nand telecommunications channels to first intercept and then decrypt\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 3\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n4 | how america lost its secrets\ntheir secret messages, the NSA goes to extraordinary lengths to keep\nthem secret. Draconian laws protect this secrecy.\nIn the first week of June 2013, the NSA learned that there had\nbeen a massive breach. Thousands of secret files bearing on communications\nintelligence had been stolen from a heavily guarded\nregional base in Oahu, Hawaii.\nThe suspect was Edward Snowden, a twenty- nine- year- old civilian\nanalyst at that base, who had fled to Hong Kong before the\nbreach was discovered. According to a three- count criminal complaint\nfiled by federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia,\nSnowden had stolen government property and violated the\nEspionage Act by the unauthorized and willful communication of\nnational defense information to an unauthorized person. He also\nlikely violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by entering computer\nsystems illicitly.\nThis was not a whodunit mystery. On June 9, 2013, in an extraordinary\ntwelve- minute video made in a cramped hotel room in Hong\nKong, Snowden identified himself as the person who had taken the\nNSA documents. Watching the video, the world saw a shy, awkward,\nand sympathetic- looking man wearing a rumpled shirt, rimless\nglasses, and a computer- geek haircut, passionately speaking out\nagainst what he termed the NSA’s violations of the law and, in a\nshaky voice, expressing his willingness to suffer the consequences\nfor exposing them.\nSnowden had an innocent, idealistic, principled look about him,\nand the world was ready to congratulate him for revealing the NSA’s\nalleged illegal collection of data inside the United States. But in fact,\nSnowden had stolen a great deal more than documents relating to\ndomestic surveillance. He had also stolen secret documents from the\nNSA, the CIA, the Department of Defense, and the British cipher\nservice revealing the sources and methods they employed in their\nmonitoring of adversaries, which was their job.\nBy the time the theft had been discovered, in the first week of\nJune 2013, it was impossible for the FBI, a grand jury, or any other\nU.S. agency to question him because he had fled the country. His\nfirst stop, Hong Kong, the economically autonomous city of 7.2 million,\nis a special administrative region of mainland China. Under the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 4\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nPrologue | 5\nterms of the 1997 transfer of sovereignty from Great Britain, China\nis responsible for Hong Kong’s defense and foreign policy, including\nintelligence services. He then proceeded to Russia, which has no\nextradition treaty with the United States. Russia granted him asylum,\nmaking it unlikely that U.S. authorities would ever have the\nopportunity to question him.\nSnowden’s escape left in its wake an incredibly important unsolved\nmystery: How had a young analyst in training at the NSA succeeded\nin penetrating all the layers of NSA security to pull off the largest\ntheft of secret documents in the history of American intelligence?\nDid he act alone? What happened to the documents? Was his arrival\nin Russia part of the plan?\nBecause I had written several books on the vulnerability of intelligence\nservices, this was a mystery— a “howdunit,” if you like— that\nimmediately intrigued me. Even if Snowden had acted for the most\nsalutary of reasons, the unauthorized transfer of state secrets from\nthe United States to an adversary country is, by almost any definition,\na form of espionage.\nI decided to begin my investigation of this case in Hong Kong,\nbecause it was the place to which Snowden first fled after leaving\nHawaii. Snowden had planned the trip for at least four weeks,\naccording to the mandatory travel plan he had filed at the NSA.\nWhen I spoke to my sources in the intelligence community, they\ncould not explain Snowden’s choice. It would not necessarily protect\nhim from the reach of U.S. law, because Hong Kong had an active\nextradition treaty with the United States. Just a few months earlier,\nHong Kong had made headlines by honoring America’s request to\nextradite Trent Martin, a fugitive wanted for insider trading.\nNor was Hong Kong particularly convenient to Hawaii. There\nwere no nonstop flights there from Honolulu in May 2013. Snowden\nflew eight hours to Narita International Airport in Japan, where he\nwaited almost three hours. He then flew five hours to Hong Kong.\nSnowden could have flown to countries that do not have extradition\ntreaties with America in far less time.\nAdding to this mystery, at the time he departed Honolulu,\nSnowden had not yet arranged for any journalists to meet him in\nHong Kong, and as far as U.S. intelligence could determine, he had\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 5\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n6 | how america lost its secrets\nno known appointments there. Even so, Snowden carried to Hong\nKong digital copies he had made of the top secret NSA documents.\nAs General Michael Hayden, who served as the head of both the\nNSA and the CIA, told me, “It’s very mysterious why Snowden\nchose Hong Kong.” We can assume he had a compelling enough reason\nfor him to take the risk that he would be arrested there by Hong\nKong police after U.S. authorities invoked the detention provision\nof its extradition treaty. It was of course possible that Snowden had\ntraveled there to see someone he believed could protect him.\nI arrived in Hong Kong on May 20, 2014— exactly one year after\nSnowden had arrived there aboard a Japan Airlines flight. I checked\nin to the Mira hotel in the Tsim Sha Tsui shopping district of Kowloon,\na ten- minute ferry ride away from Hong Kong Island, where\nmost of the foreign consulates are located.\nI chose the Mira because it was the five- star hotel in which\nSnowden had stayed and where he had made the celebrated video\nadmitting his role in taking the NSA documents. I asked at the front\ndesk for room 1014, the same one that Snowden had occupied in\n2013, because I wanted easy access to the hotel’s service and security\npersonnel responsible for the room who might have had contact\nwith Snowden a year earlier. Unfortunately, that room was occupied,\nbut I was given a nearby room that served my purpose.\nSnowden had told Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, the\nGuardian reporters he met in Hong Kong, that he had hidden out\nat the Mira hotel since his arrival in Hong Kong because he feared\nthat the CIA might capture him. My first surprise was that Snowden\nhad not arrived at the Mira until eleven days after he arrived in\nHong Kong. As I learned from the hotel staff, Snowden had registered\nthere under his real name and used his own passport and credit\ncard to secure the room, an odd choice if he was hiding out. He had\nchecked in to the hotel not on May 20, as he had told the reporters,\nbut on June 1, 2013. He checked out on June 10.\nWherever Snowden stayed from May 20 to June 1, he apparently\nconsidered it a safe enough place from which to send Greenwald a\n“welcome package,” as he called it, of twenty top secret NSA docu-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 6\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nPrologue | 7\nments on May 25. He had now not only downloaded documents but\nalso violated the oath he had signed when he took his job by providing\nthem to an unauthorized party. During this period, Snowden\nalso contacted Barton Gellman, on behalf of The Washington Post,\nvia e- mail. Indeed, while he was staying someplace other than the\nplace he claimed to be staying, he made almost all the arrangements\nfor his journalistic coming- out. He was in contact with at least one\nforeign mission during this period, according to what he wrote to\nGellman on May 24. In that e- mail, concerning when and how his\nstory was to be published by The Washington Post, Snowden asked\nGellman to include some text that would help Snowden with his\ndealings with this mission. But which country was he approaching?\nIn an effort to establish Snowden’s whereabouts during these “missing”\neleven days, which, among other things, could shed light on\nwhy he first came to Hong Kong, I called Keith Bradsher, a prizewinning\njournalist who had been the New York Times bureau chief in\nHong Kong in 2013. He had written a well- researched report about\nSnowden’s arrival there. He proposed we meet at the Foreign Correspondents’\nClub.\nBradsher told me that he had known Albert Ho, who had been\nretained as Snowden’s lawyer, for more than a decade. He had interviewed\nhim many times, because he was a leader of a political movement\nin Hong Kong. Bradsher said that a few days after Snowden\nhad revealed himself on June 9, he met with Ho and questioned him\nabout Snowden’s unknown whereabouts.\nHo told Bradsher that all of Snowden’s logistics had been arranged\nfor him by an intermediary, whom Ho called a “carer.” Ho said that\nSnowden had been in contact with the “carer” prior to his arrival in\nHong Kong on May 20. According to Ho, it was this person who had\narranged accommodations for Snowden on his arrival and afterward.\nIf so, it seemed to me that this person might be able to shed light\non whom, if anyone, Snowden saw in his first eleven days in Hong\nKong. Even if this person might have been unaware of the reasons\nfor Snowden’s trip to Hong Kong when he made the arrangements\nfor him, he was still the best lead I had to learning why Snowden\nhad come to Hong Kong. Bradsher told me that he pressed Ho for\ndetails about this mystery person over the course of several meet-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 7\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n8 | how america lost its secrets\nings but Ho would not identify him beyond saying that he was a\n“well- connected resident” of Hong Kong.\nI called Ho’s law office in Hong Kong. He politely declined to be\ninterviewed by me, saying he had said all he was going to say about\nthe Snowden case. I was able, though, to make an appointment with\nRobert Tibbo, a Canadian- born barrister specializing in civil liberties\ncases. Tibbo had worked closely with Ho on the Snowden case.\nI met Tibbo in the tearoom at the Mandarin Oriental hotel on\nHong Kong Island. Tibbo, in his early fifties, was tall, with a round\nface and thinning hair. He talked freely about his remarkable career.\nAfter earning a degree in chemical engineering from McGill University\nand working in Asia as an engineer for a decade, he went to law\nschool in New Zealand and became a barrister in Hong Kong specializing\nin cases involving the legal status of refugees.\nOver a leisurely tea, Tibbo made it clear that he had played a far\nmore active role than Ho in the Snowden case. He had even personally\nescorted Snowden from the Mira hotel to a safe house on\nJune 10. He did not dispute what Ho had told Bradsher. When I asked\nhim if he could give me the name of the “carer,” he said that he was\nbound by a lawyer- client privilege that prevented him from providing\nme with any details that might reveal the identity of the person\nwho had made arrangements for Snowden. When I asked the date\nthat he was officially retained by Snowden, he said that Snowden\nhad signed an agreement hiring him and Ho’s law firm as his legal\nadviser on June 10, 2013 (which was a matter of public record).\n“I understand that,” I said, “but I am inquiring about something\nthat had happened before you became his legal adviser.” He shook\nhis head, as if getting rid of a pesky fly, and said that his oath precluded\nhim from saying anything at all that might do damage to\nthe credibility of his client. “Not even where he was staying in May\nin Hong Kong?” I persisted. He leaned forward and, after a brief\nhesitation, said, jokingly I assumed, that he would not divulge that\ninformation, “even if you held a gun to my head.” We met two more\ntimes, but true to his word Tibbo would not say if he even knew the\nidentity of the “carer.”\nMeanwhile, Joyce Xu, a very resourceful Chinese journalist who\nwas assisting me in Hong Kong, had filed the equivalent of a Freedom\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 8\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nPrologue | 9\nof Information request with the Hong Kong Security Bureau asking\nfor information about Snowden’s movements in May. Thomas\nNg, the secretary for security, turned down the request, adding that\nHong Kong authorities do not keep records of hotel registrations. I\nhad run into a dead end with the Hong Kong authorities on the issue\nof Snowden’s “carer” and Snowden’s whereabouts for those eleven\ncrucial days.\nAt this point, I got some much- needed help from an old friend on\nthe Obama White House staff. Before I had left New York, I asked\nhim if he could find someone at the consulate in Hong Kong who\nmight brief me on the Snowden case. I didn’t hear from him until\njust a few days before I was due to return to New York. He put me\nin touch with a former employee of the Hong Kong consulate, who\nhe said was “fully informed” about the efforts of the U.S. mission to\nlocate Snowden in Hong Kong. This person was still living in Hong\nKong, and he agreed to meet with me on condition that I did not\nmention either his name or his specific job in the U.S. mission in\nHong Kong. The venue was the terrace lounge of the American Club\nin Exchange Square in central Hong Kong, a posh club mainly for\nexpatriate Americans. It was on the forty- eighth floor, with a spectacular\nview of Victoria Harbor. Once there, I had no problem finding\nmy source, identifying him by the description he had given me.\nHe was sitting alone at a discreet table in the corner.\nAfter we ordered drinks, he told me in a soft voice about the American\nreaction to Snowden’s revelations in Hong Kong. “All hell broke\nloose,” he said, describing the atmosphere at the U.S. mission after\nSnowden’s video was posted on The Guardian’s website on June 9.\nI asked about an assertion that Snowden had made concerning the\nU.S. consulate in that extraordinary video. Snowden had said that he\ncould be seized at any moment by a CIA rendition team based at the\nU.S. consulate “just down the road” from the Mira hotel.\n“Was that true?” I asked.\nHe rolled his eyes and said, “Snowden has a pretty wild imagination.\nFor one thing, the U.S. consulate is not down the road from the\nMira in Kowloon; it is here on Hong Kong Island. And there was no\nCIA rendition team in Hong Kong.”\nMy next question concerned a second period during which\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 9\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n10 | how america lost its secrets\nSnowden’s whereabouts are clouded— the period between the time\nhe left the Mira hotel on June 10 and the day he left Hong Kong for\nRussia on June 23. When I asked my consulate source whether the\nU.S. mission took any action to track Snowden during these thirteen\ndays, he explained that the FBI had long maintained a contingent\nof “legal attachés” based at the consulate to pursue many possible\nviolations of U.S. law including video piracy. In addition, the CIA\nand the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) had retained a handful of\n“China watchers” under diplomatic cover in Hong Kong. This group\nconstituted the “intelligence mission,” as he referred to it. It had\ndeveloped informal relations with the Hong Kong police that, along\nwith the NSA’s electronic capabilities abroad, allowed it to track\nSnowden’s movements after he had outed himself on the video.\nBecause Snowden, his lawyers, and the journalists in his entourage\nfrequently used their cell phones to text one another, it was fairly\neasy for the U.S. intelligence mission to follow Snowden’s trail after\nhe left the Mira hotel. He said that the Hong Kong police also knew\nwhere he was during this period. My source further suggested that\nthe massive Chinese intelligence contingent in Hong Kong also\nknew, because it had close relations with the Hong Kong police.\n“So everyone knew Snowden’s whereabouts as he moved every\nfew days from apartment to apartment,” I interjected. He answered\nthat it was no secret to anyone except the media and the public. “Of\ncourse we knew,” he said, adding that there were also photographs\nof Snowden entering the office building that housed the Russian\nconsulate. I mentioned that there was a report in a Russian newspaper\nthat Snowden had visited the Russian consulate in late June in\nconnection with the flight he later took to Moscow. “All we know is\nhe entered the building,” he answered, with a shrug.\nThat Russian consulate visit did not come as a complete surprise\nto U.S. intelligence. After Snowden left the Mira, his interactions\nwith the Russian and Chinese intelligence services in Hong Kong\nhad been closely monitored by “secret means,” a term that in that\ncontext likely indicated electronic surveillance. A former top intelligence\nexecutive in Washington, D.C., subsequently confirmed this\nmonitoring to me. All of Snowden’s stealth in exiting from the Mira\nhotel, which included wearing a baseball cap and dark glasses, thus\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 10\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nPrologue | 11\nproved ineffective in hiding him from U.S. intelligence and presumably\nother intelligence services seeking the treasure trove of documents\nhe had taken from the NSA.\nAs for his next destination, I could find no evidence that Snowden\nhad made any arrangements during his monthlong stay in Hong\nKong to go to any Latin American country. Before he went public\non June 9, he could have easily gotten a visa in Hong Kong with his\nstill- valid passport to go to almost any country in the world, including\nCuba (for which a U.S. passport was not necessary), Bolivia, and\nEcuador. Yet he did not apply for visas during this time period. Even\nas late as June 8, after meetings with Greenwald and Poitras, his\nname had still not been revealed, no criminal complaint had been\nissued against him, and there was no Interpol red alert for his detention.\nHe could have walked out of the Mira hotel, caught a taxi to\nthe Hong Kong airport, and gone on Swiss International Air Lines\nvia Zurich to any country in South America or to Iceland. But, as\nin the oft- cited Sherlock Holmes clue of the dog that did not bark,\nSnowden’s inaction in not obtaining visas during this thirty- day\nperiod suggests that he had no plans to go anyplace but where he\nwent: Moscow.\nHowever, the mystery that most concerned me was not where\nSnowden was housed in the interim between when he went public\nand when he went to Moscow. It was where, and in whose care,\nSnowden had been before he checked into the Mira on June 1. When\nI asked my source about this period, he said that as far as he knew,\nneither the FBI nor the Hong Kong police could find a trace of him\nduring the period between May 20, when he passed through Hong\nKong customs, and June 1, when he first used his credit card and\npassport to check into the Mira hotel. Other than those transactions,\nthey could not find any credit card charges, ATM withdrawals,\ntelephone calls, hotel registrations, subway pass purchases, or other\nclues to Snowden’s activities. As far as a paper trail was concerned,\nSnowden was a ghost during this period.\n“Could an American just vanish in Hong Kong for eleven days?”\nI asked.\n“Apparently, he did just that,” my source replied.\nSnowden’s whereabouts during these eleven days was not a mys-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 11\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n12 | how america lost its secrets\ntery I was going to solve on this first trip to Hong Kong. I needed to\nknow more about his activities before he got there. After all, Snowden\nwas not, as he himself pointed out from Moscow, an “angel descending\nfrom the heavens.” He had been working for the U.S. government\nfor the previous seven years. During that period, he had been\npart of America’s secret intelligence regime and held a clearance for\nsensitive compartmented information, or SCI. Such SCI material is\nconsidered so sensitive that it must be handled within formal access\ncontrol systems established by the director of national intelligence.\nNor did Snowden’s breach begin with his handing over classified\ndocuments to the Guardian reporters in Hong Kong in June 2013 or,\nfor that matter, in the eleven days prior to his meeting with journalists.\nHe had, as the NSA quickly determined, begun illicitly copying\ndocuments in the summer of 2012. Such a dangerous enterprise is\nnot born of a sudden impulse. It was, as his actions suggested, nurtured\nover many months. Even if he had managed to elude American\nintelligence from late May to early June 2013, he could not hide all\nthe history that led to his decision to come to Hong Kong. There\nhad to be an envelope of circumstances surrounding it, including\nSnowden’s motivation, associates, movements, finances, and activities\nprior to his fleeing to Hong Kong. What was missing was not\njust Snowden’s first eleven days in Hong Kong but the context of\nthe alleged crime.\nI first needed to find out who Edward Snowden was.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 12\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\npart one\nSNOWDEN’S ARC\nI woke this morning with a new name.

His parents were Lon Snowden and\nElizabeth “Wendy” Barrett. According to their marriage records,\nthey wed when they were both eighteen in 1979. The following year\nthey had a daughter, Jessica.\nLon Snowden, like his father before him, served in the U.S. Coast\nGuard. He was stationed at its main aviation base, where his fatherin-\nlaw, Edward Joseph Barrett, was an officer and rising star of the\nCoast Guard. While Edward Snowden was still a child, his maternal\ngrandfather would become not only an admiral but also head of the\nCoast Guard’s entire aviation service.\nWhen Lon was transferred to a Coast Guard base near Baltimore\nin 1992, he bought a two- story house in Crofton, Maryland, a residential\ncommunity very close to the NSA’s headquarters building\nat Fort Meade. Edward, who was nine, and Jessica, who was twelve,\nwere enrolled in local public schools in Crofton.\nJessica was a top student.

Unlike his sister, Edward Snowden experienced a string of\nfailures in his education. In 1998, after only one year of classes, he\ndropped out of Arundel High School; according to school records,\nhe stopped attending classes at the age of fifteen. He later attributed\nhis absence from school to a medical problem, mononucleosis, but\naccording to Robert Mosier, a spokesman for Anne Arundel County\npublic schools, there is no record of any illness. Brad Gunson, who\nknew Snowden before he dropped out of high school, recalled in an\ninterview with The Washington Post only that he had a high- pitched\nvoice, liked magic cards, and played fantasy video games.\nInstead of completing a formal education, Snowden went his own\nway. Still in his teens, he became the product of a broken home. His\nparents were entangled in messy divorce proceedings until he was\nseventeen. By this time, Jessica had her own apartment. When his\nparents separated, Snowden’s mother bought a two- bedroom condominium\nin Ellicott City, Maryland. She moved Edward, along with\nhis two cats, into the condominium, while she remained in the family\nhouse awaiting its sale. According to a condominium neighbor,\nJoyce Kinsey, Snowden stayed home alone almost all the time. From\nwhat she could observe, he spent long hours in front of a computer\nscreen.\nAt the age of eighteen, while other teens his age went to college,\nSnowden was still living by himself, now devoting a large part of his\ntime to playing fantasy games on the Internet. Posting under the\nalias TheTrueHooHa on a website called Ars Technica, he showed\nhimself to be a passionate gamer. He was especially drawn to anime,\na graphically violent style of Japanese animation. These anime\ngames had by 2002 achieved a fanatic following in both Japan and\nthe United States. He claimed special skills at Tekken, a martial arts\nfighting game. He even went to anime conventions in the Washington,\nD.C., area. When he became a webmaster for Ryuhana Press,\na website running these anime- based games, he described himself\nsomewhat fancifully as a thirty- seven- year- old father of two children.\nThe only truth in his description was that he was born on “the\nlongest day of the year” (June 21).\nHe wrote Internet posts under his TrueHooHa alias about how he\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 16\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nTinker | 17\nused weight lifting and intensive training to precision shape his body.\nHe bragged to his online followers that he had reduced his “body fat\npercentage to between 9.5% and 10.5%” (which was less than half\nof the average for his age). He wrote that he wore “cool” purple sunglasses,\npracticed martial arts, and was a fan of Japanese cuisine. He\ndescribed himself at one point, as if advertising his virtues, as having\na “head of vibrant, shimmering blond hair (with volume).”\nHe appeared somewhat restless with his solitary life in his almost\ndaily postings. He expressed a longing to go to Japan. “I’ve always\ndreamed of being able to ‘make it’ in Japan. I’ve taken Japanese for\na year and a half,” he wrote in 2002. Despite his claim of learning\nJapanese, there is no record of his taking any courses in Japanese.\nBut it was perhaps part of his yearning. In pursuit of an employment\nopportunity in Japan, he posted, “I’d love a cushy gov job over\nthere.” Eventually, he gave up on the idea of relocating himself to\nJapan because, as he explained in a post, he would have to put his cats\nin quarantine for six months.\nSnowden’s father meanwhile moved to Pennsylvania with his\nnew wife- to- be. This left Snowden with only one male family member\nin the area, his maternal grandfather, Admiral Barrett, who was\nnow in the top echelon of U.S. intelligence working at the Pentagon.\nBarrett was there when a plane piloted by terrorists crashed into it\non 9/11. He emerged unscathed.\nSnowden sought to join the Special Forces through the 18X program,\na U.S. Army Reserve program created in 2003 that allowed\nindividuals who had not served in the military or completed their\neducation to train to be a Special Forces recruit. He listed his religion\non the application as Buddhist because, as he explained in a sardonic\npost on Ars Technica, “agnostic is strangely absent” from the form.\nHe enlisted in the army reserves on May 7, 2004, according to\nU.S. Army records. He reported for a ten- week basic training at Fort\nBenning, Georgia, which was standard for all enlistees in the infantry.\nIn August, he began a three- week course in parachute jumping\nbut did not complete that training. As Snowden put it in his Internet\npostings, he “washed out.” He was discharged on September 29,\n2004, ending his nineteen- week military career. Snowden would\nlater claim on the Internet that he returned to civilian life because\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 17\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n18 | how america lost its secrets\nhe had broken both legs. An army spokesman could not confirm that\nSnowden injured his legs or that he was in fact dropped from the\nprogram for medical reasons.\nUnder his TrueHooHa alias, Snowden wrote that “they [the army]\nheld on to me until the doctors cleared me to be discharged, and then\nafter being cleared they held onto me for another month just for\nshits and giggles.” He attributed this treatment in the army, as he\nwould later attribute his problems in the CIA and the NSA, to the\ninferior intelligence of his superiors. He wrote in his post, “Psych\nproblems = dishonorable discharge depending on how much they\nhate you. Lots of alleged homos were in the hold unit, too, but they\nonly got a general discharge at best.”\nIf he had broken his legs, it was not evident to Joyce Kinsey, his\nnext- door neighbor, who told me that she never saw Snowden on\ncrutches when he returned to his mother’s condominium in September\n2004. Army records show that he did not receive a medical\ndischarge. He received an “administrative discharge.” Unlike a medical\ndischarge, which is given because a soldier has sustained injuries\nthat prevent him from performing his duties, an administrative discharge\nis a “morally neutral” form of separation given to a soldier\nwhen he or she is deemed for nonmedical reasons inappropriate for\nmilitary service. Snowden preferred to cite a medical explanation for\nhis severance, just as he had claimed a medical reason for dropping\nout of high school (and would later claim he needed medical treatment\nfor epilepsy at the NSA).\nWhen he returned home from Fort Benning, Georgia, he was\ntwenty- one. He remained unemployed for several months before\ntaking a job as a security guard at the University of Maryland’s Center\nfor Advanced Study of Language, where he was given his first\nsecurity clearance. Snowden had to take a polygraph exam to get\nthe job. According to his Ars Technica postings, he worked the night\nshift from six in the evening to six in the morning. He had higher\nambitions than being a campus security guard.\nHe wanted to become a male model. He did not seem overly concerned\nabout his privacy, posting pictures of himself on the Internet\n“mooning” for the camera. He also posted provocative modeling pictures\nof himself on the Ars Technica website. He commented on his\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 18\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nTinker | 19\nown beefcake- style pictures, “So sexxxy it hurts” and “I like my girlish\nfigure that attracts girls.” He approached a model agency called\nModel Mayhem, which recommended a photographer. He had some\nconcern about that photographer because he, as Snowden wrote in\na post, “shoots mostly guys.” Snowden said he was “a little worried\nhe might, you know, try to pull my pants off and choke me to death\nwith them, but he turned out to be legit and is a pretty damn good\nmodel photographer.” He posted the photographs on the Internet.\nThe lack of any paid job offers dashed Snowden’s hopes for a modeling\ncareer.\nAround this time, he began dating Lindsay Mills, an extremely\nattractive nineteen- year- old art student at the Maryland Institute\nCollege of Art. Jonathan Mills, Lindsay’s father, was an applications\ndeveloper at the Oracle Corporation. According to him, Snowden\nmet his daughter on an Internet dating site. Snowden and Mills had\nmuch in common. They both had divorced parents who gave them a\ngreat deal of latitude in conducting their personal lives. Both of them\nwere keenly interested in perfecting their bodies through exercise\nand diet regimes. Mills’s only paid employment over the next eight\nyears would be as a fitness and yoga instructor in Maryland. When\nthey first met, they both had ambitions to be models, and neither of\nthem had inhibitions about posing provocatively for photographers.\nThey both also had a desire to travel to exotic places, including cities\nin Asia. Mills had spent four month in Guilin, China, before meeting\nSnowden.\nAs bleak as his prospects as a high-school dropout might have\nseemed, Snowden had an unexpected stroke of good fortune in the\nspring of 2006. The CIA offered him a $66,000- a- year job as a CIA\ncommunications officer. “I don’t have a degree of ANY type. In fact,\nI don’t even have a high school diploma,” Snowden boasted in May\n2006 on the website Ars Technica under his alias. He added, with\nonly a slight exaggeration, “I make 70K.”\nHow did Snowden get the job? The CIA’s minimum requirements\nin 2006 for a job in its clandestine division included a bachelor’s or\nmaster’s degree and a strong academic record, with a preferred GPA\nof 3.0 or better.\nThe CIA needed technical workers in 2006. But even if Snowden\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 19\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n20 | how america lost its secrets\napplied only in this capacity, which entailed a five- year employment\nagreement, the minimum requirement for an intelligence technology\njob was an associate’s degree awarded by a two- year community\ncollege in electronics and communications, engineering technology,\ncomputer network systems, or electronics engineering technology.\nCandidates had to have had a final GPA of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale\nfrom a fully accredited technical school or university. Snowden, as\nwe’ve seen, did not meet these standards. If a candidate lacks these\nqualifications, the CIA can make an exception only if he or she has\nat least two years’ civilian or military work experience in the telecommunications\nand/or automated information systems field that is\ncomparable to one of the requisite degree fields. Snowden in no way\nqualified in this way either.\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, even the minimum requirements\nmight be waived if the applicant had a distinguished military\ncareer and an honorable discharge. Snowden, however, did not\ncomplete his military training at Fort Benning and received only an\nadministrative discharge.\nThe CIA, to be sure, had needed computer- savvy recruits to service\nits expanding array of computer systems since 1990. By 2006,\nhowever, there was no shortage of fully qualified applicants for IT\njobs who met the CIA’s minimum standards. Most of them had university\ncourse records, work experience at IT companies, computer\nscience training certificates from technical schools, and other such\ncredentials. The CIA, like the NSA, also obtained technicians with\nspecial skills for IT jobs from outside contractors. So it had no need\nfor employing a twenty- two- year- old dropout who did not meet its\nrequisites. According to Tyler Drumheller, a former CIA station chief\nin Europe, the only plausible way that Snowden, with no qualifications,\nwas allowed to jump the queue was that “he had some pull.”\nIn 2006, Snowden’s grandfather, who had attained the rank of\nrear admiral, was certainly well connected in the intelligence world.\nAfter twenty years’ service in the Coast Guard, Barrett had joined\nan interagency task force in 1998, which included top executives\nfrom the CIA, the FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.\nIt had been set up to monitor any gaps in the U.S. embargo on Cuba,\nand Barrett, as one of its leaders, was in constant liaison with the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 20\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nTinker | 21\nCIA. By 2004, he had joined the FBI as the section head of its aviation\nand special operations. In this capacity, he supervised the joint\nCIA- FBI interrogation of the prisoners in the Guantánamo base in\nCuba, which involved him in the rendition program for terrorists.\nBarrett could certainly have played a role in furthering his only\ngrandson’s employment. The CIA, however, has not disclosed any\ninformation about who, if anyone, recommended Snowden. All that\nis known is that in 2006 the CIA waived its minimum requirements\nfor him.\nLater Snowden pointed out from Moscow that in 2006 the federal\ngovernment employed his entire family. His father was serving\nin the Coast Guard; his mother was an administrative clerk for the\nfederal court in Maryland; his sister was a research director at the\nFederal Judicial Center; and Admiral Barrett was still a top executive\nat the FBI. In a sense, Snowden had entered the family business.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 21\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nchapter 2\nSecret Agent\nSure, a whistleblower could use these [NSA computer vulnerabilities],\nbut so could a spy.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2014\nThe sudden transformation of Snowden in 2006 from a\nnight watchman on a university campus to an employee for\nthe CIA provided him with a powerful new identity and one much\ncloser to the avatars he adopted for his fantasy games. It was burnished\nso deeply in his self- image that he cited it eight years later,\nin exaggerated fashion, in Moscow. When Brian Williams, then an\nNBC anchorman, began an hour- long television interview with\nSnowden in 2014 by saying, “It seems to me spies probably look a\nlot more like Ed Snowden and a lot less like James Bond these days,”\nSnowden approvingly smiled and told him, “I was trained as a spy\nin sort of the traditional sense of the word.” Snowden further confirmed\nhis interviewer’s point, stating, “I lived and worked undercover\noverseas— pretending to work in a job that I’m not [in]— and\neven being assigned a name that was not mine.”\nIn reality, Snowden’s employment at the CIA was far more prosaic.\nWhen he joined the CIA, he did not have the required experience\nin maintaining secret communication systems, so the CIA sent\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 22\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nSecret Agent | 23\nhim to its information technology school for six months to train as\na communications officer, not a spy. After completing his training,\nhe was dispatched to the CIA station in Geneva. He worked there\nfor the next two years as one of dozens of information technologists\nservicing the CIA’s communication channels in Switzerland. He was\nstationed there, according to Swiss registry records, under his own\nname from March 2007 to February 2009. He was identified as a U.S.\nState Department employee in Geneva because Switzerland does\nnot allow any intelligence officers to operate in its country. Officially,\nhe was attached to the permanent U.S. mission to the United\nNations, which employed hundreds of U.S. government functionaries\nin Switzerland. It was a thin cover; the Swiss government was\naware that the CIA maintained its base in Geneva and posted its\nemployees at the U.S. mission.\nAlthough Snowden would claim in a video he made in Hong\nKong that he had served as a “senior adviser for the Central Intelligence\nAgency,” he was merely a telecommunications support officer,\nor TSO in CIA parlance, which was a junior- level job at the CIA.\nHe worked as part of a team of information technologists under the\nsupervision of senior CIA officers, according to a former CIA officer\nin Geneva. The job of these TSOs was to protect the security of the\nCIA’s computer systems through which the CIA station in Geneva\nsent and received its secret communications.\nAs far as is known, Snowden made very few friends at the eighthundred-\nperson mission. The only person to have publicly reported\nknowing him in Geneva during this period is Mavanee Anderson, a\nyoung and attractive summer intern at the U.S. mission from May\nto August 2007. She described befriending Snowden, who, according\nto her, said that he was in the CIA and also demonstrated to her his\nmartial arts skills. She later recalled in interviews that he was “a bit”\nprone to brooding and voiced growing dissatisfaction with the CIA.\nThe job in Geneva did have its benefits, however. It provided him\nwith a generous housing and travel allowance. In many ways, it was\nthe “cushy government job” he had said he was seeking in his Internet\nposts. He rented a four- room apartment and had his girlfriend,\nLindsay Mills, now twenty- one, join him there.\nAccording to his posts on the Ars Technica website, he took full\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 23\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n24 | how america lost its secrets\nadvantage of his compensation to live the high life. He gambled on\nfinancial developments by buying and selling options, which are\ncontracts that allow speculators to bet on the directions of the market\nwithout buying the actual stocks, bonds, or commodities. He also\nbought a BMW sports car on which, he wrote, he disabled the speed\ncontrol so he could exceed the legal limit. He described in his posts\nracing motorcycles in Italy and traveling around Germany with an\nEstonian rock star (whom he did not further identify). He also continued\nhis avatar life in Internet gaming; the alias he chose for that\nwas Wolfking Awesomefox. He also indulged in a fantasy gun sport\ncalled Airsoft, a variation of paintball, in which participants used\nrealistic- looking pistols to splatter each other with paint.\nSnowden’s good fortune came to an abrupt end in 2008. He suffered\na massive loss in his options speculations. He wrote in a post\nthat he had “lost $20,000 in October [2008] alone,” a sum that represented\nalmost a third of his annual salary. He blamed the U.S. financial\nsystem, posting on Ars Technica that Ben Bernanke, the Federal\nReserve chairman, was a “cockbag.” He also bet against any further\nrise in the stock market index, asking a user with whom he was chatting\non the Internet in December 2008 to “pray” for a collapse of\nstock prices. When his correspondent asked him why he wanted him\nto pray for a decline, Snowden responded, “Because then I’ll be filthy\nfucking rich.” But Snowden lost this bet.\nSnowden lashed out at others on the Internet over these setbacks.\nHe termed those who questioned his financial judgment “fucking\nretards.” As with other setbacks, he blamed them on government officials\nin Ars Technica posts. Because the CIA was engaged in 2008 in\nhighly sensitive operations to gather banking data in Switzerland—\none of which Snowden later disclosed to The Guardian— any Internet\ndiscussion by a CIA employee of financial losses could serve as a\nbeacon to an adversary intelligence service on the prowl for a source.\nIf any party was looking for disgruntled U.S. employees, Snowden’s\nInternet chatter about bad choices in gambling could have aroused\nits interest.\nThat Snowden used his TrueHooHa alias for these Internet postings\nwould not prevent a sophisticated espionage organization from\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 24\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nSecret Agent | 25\nquickly uncovering his true identity. He was listed by his true name\non the roster of the U.S. mission to the UN. By consulting personnel\nrecords, one would further discover that he did not actually work for\nthe State Department. Because it was no secret that the U.S. mission\nin Geneva housed the CIA station for all of Switzerland, any outsider\nwould think it probable that this brittle gambler who played\nthe options market worked for the CIA.\nEven though it cannot be precluded that Snowden was spotted\nin Geneva by another intelligence service, there is no evidence, at\nleast that I know of, to suggest that he was approached by one. Nor\nis there reason to believe that if he had been contacted by a foreign\nservice in 2008, he would have responded positively. Despite\nhis indiscreet posting about his outside activities, he apparently still\nrespected the boundaries of secrecy that had been clearly defined in\nthe oath he had taken at the CIA. For example, after The New York\nTimes published an article revealing secret American intelligence\nactivities in Iran on January 11, 2009, Snowden railed against the\nnewspaper on the Internet under his TrueHooHa alias. He wrote,\n“This shit is classified for a reason. . . . It’s because this shit won’t\nwork if Iran knows what we are doing.” He clearly recognized that\nrevealing intelligence sources was extremely damaging. As for the\nTimes, he said, “Hopefully they’ll finally go bankrupt this year.”\nWhen another Internet user asked him if it was unethical to release\nnational security secrets, he answered, “YEEEEEEEEEES.”\nAs with every CIA officer, Snowden had to undergo a two- year\nevaluation and take a routine polygraph test. It was then, in December\n2008, that his superior at the CIA placed a “derog” in his file, the\nCIA’s shorthand for a derogatory comment, in an unfavorable evaluation.\nThe reason remains somewhat murky. According to a New\nYork Times story by the veteran intelligence reporter Eric Schmitt,\nSnowden’s superior had suspected that Snowden “was trying to\nbreak into classified computer files to which he was not authorized\nto have access.” Schmitt evidently had well- placed sources in the\nCIA. He said that he interviewed two senior American officials who\nwere familiar with the case. According to what they told Schmitt, the\nCIA superior had decided to “send Snowden home.” Officially, how-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 25\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n26 | how america lost its secrets\never, according to a reply by a CIA public affairs officer to the Times,\nSnowden had not been fired or accused of attempting to “break into\nclassified computer files to which he did not have authorized access.”\nA former CIA officer who had also been at the U.S. mission\nin Geneva explained the discrepancy to me. He said that the spin\nthe CIA put on the story was “necessary containment.” After the\nSnowden breach occurred in June 2013, the CIA had a problem that\ncould, as he put it, “blow up in its face.” If Snowden had been fired\nbut allowed to keep his security clearance in 2009, the CIA’s incompetence\ncould be partly blamed for the NSA’s subsequent employment\nof him. If he had broken into a computer to which he was not\nauthorized, he should have been fired if not arrested.\nWhat this spin glossed over, according to this former CIA officer,\nis the part about Snowden’s behavior that concerned his superior.\nTechnically, Snowden, as a CIA communications officer, was authorized\nto use the computer system. The problem was that Snowden\nhad deliberately misused it by adding code to it. This code could have\ncompromised the security of the CIA’s “live system.” So while what\nthe CIA public affairs officer quoted in the Times story said was correct,\nit clouded the issue.\nDuring his time in Geneva, Snowden had received no promotions\nor commendations for his work. He was threatened with a punitive\ninvestigation unless he agreed to quietly resign from the CIA. “It\nwas not a stellar career,” Drumheller, the former CIA station chief,\ntold me in 2014.\nSnowden blamed his career- ending “derog” on an “e- mail spat”\nwith a superior. From Moscow, he wrote to James Risen of the Times\nthat his superior officer ordered him not “to rock the boat.” Further,\nhe complained that the technical team at the CIA station in Geneva\nhad “brushed him off,” even though he had a legitimate grievance.\nWhen he complained about a flaw in the computer system, he said\nthat his superior took vengeance on him. He said he added the code\nto the system to prove he was right. He attributed the “derog” in\nhis file to the incompetence, blindness, and errors of his superiors.\nAccording to Snowden, he was a victim. This would not be the last\ntime he faulted superiors for their supposed incompetence. He would\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 26\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nSecret Agent | 27\nlater say that the NSA experts who examined the documents that he\nhad stolen were “totally incapable.”\nIn any case, in February 2009, Snowden not only had a careerdamaging\n“derog” in his file but faced an internal investigation of\nhis suspicious computer activities. According to Drumheller, such an\ninternal investigation would not be undertaken lightly or because of\nan “e- mail spat.” He said that such an investigation was “a big deal”\ninvolving the CIA Office of Security in Washington and possibly the\nFBI. It would also result in the temporary suspension of Snowden’s\nsecurity clearance. This left Snowden with little real choice. If he\nwanted to avoid that investigation, he had to resign from the CIA,\nwhich he did in February 2009. That was the end of the security\ninvestigation.\nHe was clearly bitter, posting on Ars Technica on January 10,\n2009, “Obama just appointed a fucking POLITICIAN to run the\nCIA!” (He was referring to Leon Panetta, President Clinton’s former\nchief of staff.) Snowden attributed the origins of his antipathy to\nU.S. intelligence to his 2007– 9 experiences in the CIA. He later told\nVanity Fair that the 2009 incident in the CIA convinced him that\nworking “through the system would lead only to reprisals.”\nSnowden, if not yet a ticking time bomb, was certainly a disgruntled\nintelligence worker before he ever got to the NSA.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 27\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nchapter 3\nContractor\nPrivate contractors don’t clear employees. The government does.\n— admiral michael mcconnell,\nformer vice- chairman, Booz Allen Hamilton\nSnowden, aged twenty- five, returned from Europe and moved\ninto his mother’s condo. Not only was he unemployed now, having\nresigned from the CIA, but his financial state had been hurt\nby the huge losses he had suffered playing the options market in\nGeneva and by the fact that he did not qualify for any CIA benefits.\nHis vision of himself as a secret agent, the unstoppable Wolfking\nAwesomefox, might have also suffered. According to the narrative\nhe later supplied to The Guardian, he had become deeply concerned\nabout the immoral way in which the CIA conducted its intelligence\noperations in Switzerland.\n“Much of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me about how\nmy government functions and what its impact is in the world. I realized\nthat I was part of something that was doing far more harm than\ngood,” Snowden told The Guardian. By way of example, he said he\nlearned that the CIA had gotten a Swiss banker drunk enough to be\narrested when he drove so the CIA could compromise him. Snowden,\nwho did not drink himself, was appalled at this ploy. Despite his\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 28\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nContractor | 29\ngrowing antagonism toward the U.S. government, he had not given\nup on, if not becoming a secret agent, working in the netherworld of\nsecret intelligence.\nThere was still a back door through which he could reenter the\nspy world. Private corporations hired civilian technicians to work\nfor spy agencies as independent contractors. By 2009, the CIA, the\nNSA, and other U.S. intelligence services had outsourced much of\nthe job of maintaining and upgrading their computer systems to\nthese private companies. They supplied the NSA with most of its\nsystem administrators and other information technology workers.\nThis arrangement allowed the NSA to effectively bypass budget\nlimits and other restrictions limiting how many NSA technicians\nit could recruit. Instead of being on the NSA’s own payroll, these\npeople nominally worked for, and received their paychecks from,\nprivate employers. In fact, many of these outside contractors worked\nfull- time for the NSA.\nSnowden applied in April 2009 to one of these private companies,\na subsidiary of the Dell computer company. To diversify out of\nmanufacturing computers, Dell had recently gone into the business\nof managing government computer systems for the NSA and other\nintelligence services. As a leading specialist in the field of corporate\ncyber security, Dell had no problem obtaining sizable contracts from\nthe NSA’s Technology Directorate. In 2008, the NSA had in effect\noutsourced to Dell the task of reorganizing the backup systems at its\nregional bases. Dell had to find thousands of independent contractors\nto work at these bases. In 2009, it was seeking to fill positions\nat the NSA’s regional base in Japan, and Snowden applied. Relocating\nwould be no issue for him because he had a longtime interest in\ngoing to Japan.\nHe had little problem obtaining the job. He had a single compelling\nqualification: like all other CIA officers, he had been given a\ntop secret clearance. For an outside contractor such as Dell, such a\nsecurity clearance was pure gold. If a potential recruit lacked it, Dell\nneeded to wait for a time- consuming background check that would\nhave to be conducted before it could deploy him or her at the NSA.\nIf a recruit already had the clearance, as Snowden did, he could begin\nworking immediately.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 29\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n30 | how america lost its secrets\nSnowden still had his security clearance, despite his highly problematic\nexit from the CIA, because the agency had instituted a policy\na few years earlier that allowed voluntarily retiring CIA officers to\nkeep their clearance for two years after they left. This “free pass,” as\none former CIA officer called the two- year grace period, had been\nintended to make it easier for retiring officers to find jobs in parts of\nthe defense industry. This accommodation, in turn, made it easier for\nthe CIA to downsize to meet its budget.\nNot only did Snowden retain his clearance, but unlike when he\nhad applied for his job at the CIA in 2006, he could now list on his\nrésumé two years of experience in information technology and\ncyber security at the CIA. Dell could check only a single fact: that\nSnowden was employed at the CIA between 2006 and 2009. His CIA\nfile, which contained the “derog,” was not available to Dell or any\nother private company because of government privacy regulations.\nEven though the CIA had “security concerns” about Snowden, it\ncould not convey them to either Dell or the NSA without violating\nthe privacy rules. “So the guy with whom the CIA had concerns left\nthe Agency and joined the ranks of the many contractors working\nin the intelligence community [IC] before CIA could inform the rest\nof the IC about its worries,” Michael Morell, then CIA deputy director,\nexplained. “He even got a pay raise.”\nObviously, this was a glitch in the security system. As a result of\nit, though, Snowden entered the secret world of the NSA only five\nmonths after being forced out of the CIA.\nFor the next forty- five months, Dell assigned him various IT tasks\nat the NSA. In June 2009, he was sent to Japan to work in the NSA\ncomplex at the U.S. Yokota Air Base, which is about two hours by car\nfrom downtown Tokyo. He moved into a small one- bedroom apartment\nin Fussa, just outside the sprawling base.\nHis initial job for Dell was teaching cyber security to army and air\nforce personnel. In this capacity, he instructed U.S. military officers\nstationed at the base in how to shield their computers from hackers.\nSuch security training had been required for military personnel\ndealing with classified material after several successful break- ins\nto U.S. military networks by China, Russia, and other adversary\nnations. It was not a challenging or interesting job.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 30\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nContractor | 31\nBut Snowden found diversions in Japan. In July 2009, Lindsay\nMills joined him there. She had become an amateur photographer,\nspecializing in arty self- portraits. She also saw herself as a global\ntourist, writing in her blog after arriving in Japan that she had traveled\nto seventeen countries. Like Snowden, she also deemed herself,\ntongue in cheek, a “super hero.” In this sense, her Internet avatar\nwas a match for Snowden’s Wolfking Awesomefox.\nIn Japan, Mills and Snowden spent time with another American\ncouple, Jennie and Joseph Chamberlin, who also worked at the\nYokota base. Jennie, a sergeant in the public affairs section of the U.S.\nAir Force, had been at art college with Mills and called herself in her\nblog the Little Red Ninja. Joseph Chamberlin was a decorated U.S.\nNavy pilot who now flew highly sensitive intelligence- gathering\nmissions from the Yokota base. Jennie described Lindsay in her blog\nas her “super- model friend.” The two couples also went on expeditions\nin Japan together. As far as is known, the Chamberlins were\nthe only Americans at the base with whom Snowden socialized. On\nAugust 17, 2009, the foursome attempted to walk up Mount Fuji,\nbut they got lost en route and wound up in the Mount Fuji gift\nshop. Jennie described the misadventure in her blog: “Our adventure\nstarted off a little rocky with our attempts to find the interstate.\nAlas, our iconic mountain was obscured by cloud. A short stop at\nthe Mt. Fuji combination soba noodle stand/gift shop was enough to\nwhet our appetite for the further exploration that is to come.” Photographs\ntaken that day show Snowden wearing Hawaiian shorts\nand a black tank top emblazoned with an eagle and the letters USA.\nThey also show Mills wearing safari shorts, a brown sweater, and\nwhat appears to be an engagement ring. “Ed was looking rather rednecky,”\nLindsay commented on one photograph. Snowden described\nher, in turn, as “nerdy.” They never made it to the top of Mount Fuji.\nSnowden also sought to advance himself by getting credit toward\na college certificate by enrolling in a summer online course at the\nUniversity of Maryland’s Asia program, which had a regional campus\non the Yokota base. Known as UMUC, it had a contract with\nthe government to provide military personnel with such educational\nopportunities. Snowden would later claim that he was taking\ncourses for a graduate degree in computer sciences, but William\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 31\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n32 | how america lost its secrets\nStevens, the assistant registrar of UMUC, who I spoke to at the base\nin 2016, told me that the program in 2009 did not provide graduate\ncourses in computer sciences. According to the program’s record,\nwhile Snowden had enrolled as a student in the summer of 2009, he\nreceived neither any credits nor a certificate.\nIn October 2009, Dell assigned Snowden a job in which he had\ndirect access to the NSA’s computers. He was now a system administrator,\nwhich is essentially a tech- savvy repairman. Dell was working\non a backup system code- named EPICSHELTER. For this contract,\nDell was transferring large chunks of data from the NSA’s main\ncomputers in Maryland to backup drives in Japan so that the system\ncould be quickly restored if there was a communications interruption.\nBecause most of the classified data was in its encrypted form, it\nhad little value to any outside party. Snowden’s job was to maintain\nthe proper functioning of computers, but as a system administrator\nhe also had privileges to call up unencrypted files. He sat in front of a\ncomputer screen all day looking for any problems in the transferring\nof files to backup servers.\nThe work was highly repetitive and exceedingly dull. Snowden\nfound time to search for anomalies in the system, and he claimed\nto have spotted a major flaw in the security system in late 2009. He\ndiscovered that a rogue system administrator in Japan could steal\nsecret data without anyone else’s realizing that it had been stolen.\nSnowden brought that to the attention of his superiors, as he later\nsaid.\nThe emergence of a rogue system administrator was not that farfetched\nin 2009. Hacktivists such as Julian Assange had adopted the\nbattle cry “Sysadmins of the world, unite.” Instead of asking them\nto “throw off their chains,” as Marx did, he asked them to send classified\ndocuments about secret government activity to the WikiLeaks\nsite. Snowden, as a “sys admin,” was aware he had the power to do\nso. He recalled in Moscow in 2014, “I actually recommended they\n[the NSA] move to two- man control for administrative access back\nin 2009.” To make his point even clearer, he added, “A whistleblower\ncould use these things, but so could a spy.” Not without irony,\nSnowden became that rogue system administrator some three years\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 32\n9/30/16 11:09 AM\nContractor | 33\nlater. In fact, he later used the very vulnerability he pointed out to\nsteal NSA documents at Dell.\nIn September 2009, still on the Dell payroll, Snowden made a tenday\ntrip to India. He later said he was on an official visit “working\nat the US embassy.” Hotel records show that he arrived at the Hyatt\nRegency in New Delhi on September 2 from Japan and at 3:30 p.m.\non September 3 checked into the Koenig Inn, an annex to Koenig\nSolutions, a school that gave crash courses on programming and\ncomputer hacking. According to Rohit Aggarwal, head of the school,\nSnowden stayed there until September 10 while taking classes\nwith a private instructor. It cost $2,000 in tuition and fees, which\nSnowden prepaid from Japan with his personal credit card. Even\nthough Snowden later said he only took courses in “programming,”\nthe school’s records show that during that week he took intensive\ncourses in sophisticated hacking techniques. The course was titled\n“Ethical Hacking,” but that was a euphemism for teaching the techniques\nof illicit hacking. The course provided tutoring on hackers’\ntools such as SpyEye and Zeus, which are used to circumvent security\nprocedures. It also demonstrated how these hacking tools could\nbe customized by criminals and spies to break into files, plant surveillance\nprograms, impersonate system administrators, assume the\nprivileges of system administrators in a network, and capture the\npasswords of others. On September 11, Snowden, according to hotel\nrecords, left India for Japan. While the stated purpose of the hacking\ntraining was to allow security consultants to detect intruders, it also\nprepared Snowden to be, if he chose to be, an intruder in the NSA\nsystem.\nOne problem with working as a contractor is that the standard\ntwo- year contracts are not necessarily renewed. Nor is there much\npossibility for advancement for IT workers. As one contractor\ntold me, “It is a dead- end job with great pay.” In the fall of 2010,\nSnowden’s contract in Japan with Dell was nearing an end.\nDell offered Snowden, and he accepted, a new position in the\nUnited States. He rented a modest suburban house shaded by a\nsakura cherry tree in a suburb of Annapolis, Maryland. Lindsay\nMills meanwhile was attending a two- week fitness training course at\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 33\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n34 | how america lost its secrets\na retreat that qualified her to be a yoga instructor. She had been living\non and off with Snowden during the previous two years abroad,\nincluding while he worked at the CIA in Switzerland and the NSA in\nJapan, and now she moved in with Snowden again. The twenty- fiveyear-\nold Mills posted on Instagram, “Finally in our first US place\ntogether.” She also put pictures online of him in bed with her, affectionately\nreferring to him in her posts as a “computer crusader.”\nHe worked on problem solving for corporate clients at Dell headquarters\nin Annapolis. In preparation for his new corporate role,\nSnowden shaved off his facial hair and, with Lindsay’s help, bought a\nRalph Lauren suit. His corporate clients were assisting the NSA, the\nCIA, and the DIA. Consequently, Snowden dealt with a wide range of\nintelligence officers and gave presentations on the vulnerabilities in\ncomputer security at the DIA- sponsored Joint Counterintelligence\nseminar. In February 2011, he attended a black tie Valentine’s Day\ngala sponsored by corporate members of the Armed Forces Communication\nand Electronics Association. The guest speaker was Michael\nHayden, who had headed the CIA when Snowden was abruptly\nforced out two years earlier. Nevertheless, Snowden joined the cue\nto have his photo taken with the former director, a perk of the charity\nevent.\nThese dealings in no way mitigated his resentment of the intelligence\nestablishment. What began at the CIA in 2009 as objections\nto what he saw as the incompetence of his superiors grew into wellarticulated\ndisapproval of the way the U.S. government conducted\nits intelligence. He found NSA surveillance particularly worrisome,\nlater telling The Guardian, “They [the NSA] are intent on making\nevery conversation and every form of behavior in the world known\nto them.” He claimed after defecting to Moscow that he had voiced\nhis concerns about what he considered illicit surveillance to ten NSA\nofficials, “none of whom took any action to address them.” The NSA\ncan find no record of these complaints, but if Snowden had indeed\ncomplained to these officials while working for Dell, his superiors\nat Dell either didn’t notice or didn’t care that they had a very disgruntled\nemployee on their hands.\nSnowden also made no secret on the Internet of his anger at the\nU.S. government and the corporations that served it. He railed on\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 34\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nContractor | 35\nthe Ars Technica site against the complicity of private corporations,\nsuch as Dell, that assisted the NSA. In his online posts in 2010,\nSnowden expressed loathing for the assistance that corporate America\nwas providing the intelligence community. “It really concerns\nme how little this sort of corporate behavior bothers those outside of\ntechnology circles,” he wrote under his TrueHooHa alias. He said he\nfeared that America was already on “a slippery slope,” and he suggested,\nperhaps adumbrating his own later actions, that this corporate\nassistance to U.S. intelligence “was entirely within our control\nto stop.”\nWhat the “computer crusader” expressed in these angry Internet\npostings was an almost obsessive concern over individuals’ freely\nsubmitting to government authority. “Society really seems to have\ndeveloped an unquestioning obedience towards spooky types,” he\nwrote on Ars Technica without mentioning that he himself worked\nfor a corporation that assisted spy agencies. He asked rhetorically\non this public forum whether the sinister slide toward a surveillance\nstate “sneaked in undetected because of pervasive government\nsecrecy.”\nThe outright contempt he expressed toward this “government\nsecrecy” did not prevent him from seeking even more secret work\nat Dell for the intelligence services. In February 2011, after his CIA\nsecurity clearance ran out, he applied to renew it. The new clearance\nnow required a new background check and filling out the government’s\n127- page Standard Form 86.\nSince 1996, background investigations for the NSA, like much of\nthe computer work at the NSA, had been outsourced to a private\ncompany. It had proceeded from the effort of the Clinton administration\nto cut the size of government by privatizing tasks that could\nbe more efficiently done by for- profit companies. U.S. Investigations\nServices, or USIS, as it is now called, which won the contract\nfor background checks, was initially owned by the private equity\nfund Carlyle Group, which later sold it to another financial group,\nProvidence Equity Partners. For the private equity and hedge funds,\nprofits were the measure of success. To increase its profits from the\ncontract with the NSA, USIS had to move more quickly in concluding\nbackground checks because it did not get paid more for extensive\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 35\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n36 | how america lost its secrets\ninvestigation. In 2006, the government learned these background\nchecks were often prematurely ended. In Snowden’s case, because\nthe CIA did not share its files with a private concern, USIS did not\nhave access to Snowden’s CIA files, and it therefore did not learn\nabout the threatened security investigation. Nor did it learn from\nthe Internet, where he always employed an alias, that he was a disgruntled\nemployee. So Snowden’s new clearance was approved in\nthe summer of 2011, allowing him to continue working for Dell on\nsecret intelligence projects.\nMeanwhile, in August 2011, Mills began her own blog titled\nL’s Journey. In it, she described herself as “a world- traveling poledancing\nsuper hero.” Many of her posted pictures were provocative\nposes of herself in her underwear and various states of undress. She\nwrote, “I’ve always wanted to be splashed on the cover of magazines,\nwith my best air- brushed look.” Her wish would be gratified two\nyears later in a way she likely did not anticipate.\nFor his part, Snowden seemed happy to encourage her fantasy\nabout being a superhero. He even gave her a Star Trek– inspired head\nvisor. Despite all the concerns he voiced about privacy, he did not\nseem to mind her provocative posts. On the contrary, he took photographs\nof her, telling her at one point that her photographs were\nnot “sexy” enough.\nSnowden was soon offered a new position by Dell at the NSA’s\nKunia regional base in Hawaii. Dell, which was in the process of\nexpanding its government consulting business, wanted him to be a\nsystem administrator on the NSA’s backup system. The NSA needed\nthis system before it could upgrade new security protocols that\nwould audit suspicious activity in real time. In Hawaii, as in Japan,\nsystem administrators still worked alone. Snowden knew from his\nexperience in Japan that this solo work in an unaudited workplace\nprovided an opportunity for a system administrator to steal documents.\nSo he might also have realized that as a solo system administrator\nin Hawaii, he would have this opportunity. Whether this\nwas on his mind or not, on March 15, 2012, he accepted this offer.\nDell agreed to pay all his relocation expenses and provide him with\na housing allowance.\nHe found a 1,559- square- foot house in Oahu, located at 94- 1044\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 36\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nContractor | 37\nEleu Street in the middle- class suburb of Waipahu. It was part of\nthe Royal Kunia development, which contained three hundred\nsimilar- looking homes. According to Albi Matco, the manager of the\ncommunity association for the development, many of the residents\nworked at military facilities in the area. The corner house Snowden\nrented was comfortable enough, with three bedrooms, a walk- in\ncloset, a living room with a high ceiling, and a single- car garage, but\nin no way lavish. It did not even have a backyard. He moved in on\nApril 2, 2012, which entailed a brief separation from his girlfriend,\nMills, who had committed herself to attending a girlfriend’s wedding\nthe following month. After he left for his new assignment, she wrote\non Instagram, “Sex toy party and then saying goodbye to my man—\nwell not goodbye so much as see you in two months.”\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 37\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nchapter 4\nThief\nWe begin by coveting what we see every day.\n— hannibal lecter, The Silence of the Lambs\nIn hawaii in 2012, Snowden was living a very comfortable life.\nHe was earning just over $120,000 a year from Dell. His housing\nallowance covered the rent and the lease on his car. He worked\nfive days a week at the NSA base. The commute, as I timed it, took\nonly ten minutes. Driving past a sign marked “Restricted Area: Keep\nOut,” and the security booth where NSA guards checked his credentials,\nhe left his car in the outdoor lot for the Kunia Regional\nSecurity Operations Center. (When I drove into the base in 2016,\nI was detained nearly two hours at the security booth before being\nturned back.)\nSnowden worked in a three-story reinforced concrete building\ncalled “the tunnel,” even though it was above the ground. It had\nbeen built during World War II to serve as an aircraft assembly\nplant. During the war, it was entirely covered with earth and shrubbery\nto proof it against Japanese bomber attacks. In 1980, the NSA\nconverted it to its regional base in Hawaii for its intelligence gather-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 38\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThief | 39\ning. Its lack of windows and the dirt covering gave it the appearance,\nwhen I viewed it in 2016, of an oblong-shaped anthill. Workers, both\nmilitary and civilian, entered through an exterior staircase in the\ncenter of the mound. Even though it is above the ground, it is known\nas the tunnel. Snowden said in describing the atmosphere, “You’re in\na vaulted space. Everybody has sort of similar clearances, everybody\nknows everybody. It’s a small world.” He said that to relieve the\ntediousness of the work, every two months or so his fellow workers\nwould circulate a picture of a naked person that showed up on\ntheir screens as part of the NSA’s surveillance of foreign suspects. He\nexplained, “You’ve got young enlisted guys, 18 to 22 years old [who\nhave] suddenly been thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility\nwhere they now have access to all of your private records. In\nthe course of their daily work they stumble across . . . an intimate\nnude photo of someone in a sexually compromising position.”\nHe knew that copying any files, including photographs, was a violation\nof NSA rules. But he did not report this illicit activity to the\nNSA, even though he later claimed that it occurred regularly. He\njoked in his Moscow interview with The Guardian that some of the\nnudes were “extremely attractive” and that viewing them was, as he\nput it, “the fringe benefits of surveillance positions.”\nSnowden identified with the Libertarian Party, and at the NSA\nhe made no effort to conceal his political support of its causes. He\nbecame an active partisan of Congressman Ron Paul, the leading figure\nin the party in 2012. “He’s so dreamy,” Snowden posted on the\nArs Technica site in March 2009 (just after he registered to vote in\nNorth Carolina, though he no longer lived there). Paul was running\nin the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, and Snowden made\na contribution of $500 to his election committee. Snowden’s attraction\nto Paul’s libertarian ideology was not that surprising. At the\ncore of Paul’s worldview was a deep hostility to the intrusion of the\ngovernment into private lives. Snowden shared this hostility, as was\nclear from his Internet postings. Like other Libertarians, Snowden\nbelieved that citizens should not be “shackled” by federal law. He\nlater addressed from Moscow via an Internet hookup a libertarian\ngathering at which Ron Paul also spoke. “Law is a lot like medi-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 39\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n40 | how america lost its secrets\ncine,” he said. “When you have too much it can be fatal.” Like Paul,\nSnowden ardently opposed any form of gun control, as did Lindsay\nMills in her online postings.\nLike other Libertarians, Snowden, a contractor for the government,\nsaw the government as an adversary. “The [American] government,”\nhe later said, “assumed upon itself, in secret, new executive powers\nwithout any public awareness or any public consent and used them\nagainst the citizenry of its own country to increase its own power,\nto increase its own awareness.” Most relevant to his future activities\nat the NSA, Snowden wholeheartedly agreed with Paul’s position\non the dangers inherent in government surveillance of U.S. citizens.\nPaul described the CIA, the organization that had forced Snowden\nout, as nothing short of a “secret government” and said that “in a\ntrue Republic, there is no place for an organization like the CIA.” He\nalso railed against NSA surveillance.\nAs is clear from Snowden’s Internet postings, he, like Ron Paul,\nhad doubts about the competence of the intelligence agencies of the\nU.S. government. Snowden’s own disillusionment about the government\nmight have begun with his rejection and perceived mistreatment\nby the Special Forces of the U.S. Army. It was almost certainly\nreinforced by his ouster from the CIA. He later told The Guardian\nthat he was disillusioned as early as 2007 when he learned about the\nCIA’s methods in compromising Swiss citizens. His critical view of\nthe U.S. government only hardened during the years he worked at\nthe NSA. He described his NSA superiors as “grossly incompetent,”\nas he later explained to a journalist from Wired magazine in Moscow.\nAt the NSA, he said employees were kept in line by “fear and\na false image of patriotism.” He said that he saw his fellow workers\ncowed into “obedience to authority” and his superiors induced to\nbreak the law. He became particularly concerned with what he called\nthe “secret powers” of the NSA. He saw them as “tremendously\ndangerous.” By this time, Snowden was fully aware that the NSA\nconducted domestic surveillance because he had used his privileges\nas a system administrator in 2012 to read the NSA inspector general’s\nreport on a 2009 surveillance program.\nNevertheless, Snowden continued to work at the NSA, where he\nwas, as he put it, “making a ton of money.” Mills joined him in his\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 40\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThief | 41\n“paradise” in June 2012, shortly before his twenty- ninth birthday.\nJust before leaving Annapolis for Hawaii, Mills posted a seminude\npicture of herself on her blog, L’s Journey. In it, her face was covered\nwith a blanket. The caption under it read, “Trying to avoid the\nchanges coming my way.” In Honolulu, she found “E.,” as she called\nSnowden in her blog, “elusive.” She found that he preferred to stay\nat home and avoided meeting other people to the point that her\nfriends “were not quite sure that E. existed.” Lindsay’s fellow performers\nin the Waikiki Acrobatic Troupe told me in 2016 that they\nrarely, if ever, saw Snowden at the practice sessions. Andrew Towl,\na juggler with the group, did briefly meet Snowden once. It was on\na hike with Lindsay in Oahu. Towl said he asked Snowden what he\nwas doing in Hawaii and Snowden answered tersely, “I work with\ncomputers,” and continued walking. Even though Mills had dated\nSnowden for eight years, most of her other friends, except for Jennie\nand Joe Chamberlin in Japan, had not met him. Next door neighbors\nI spoke to caught brief glimpses of him entering or leaving his\nhouse but did not engage him in a conversation as Snowden tended\nto avoid eye contact. If he had other social interactions in Hawaii, no\none he met came forward and spoke of meeting him, even after he\nbecame world famous.\nTwo days after his twenty- ninth birthday dinner on June 21, Mills\ndescribed him playfully as a “goof.” She wrote in her blog, “The\nuniverse is telling me something and I’m pretty sure it’s saying get\nout, Fuck you Hawaii.” In early July, she summed up her shaky situation\nwith Snowden in another blog, writing, “I moved to Hawaii\nto continue my relationship with E. [but] it has been an emotional\nroller coaster since I stepped off the plane.” She diverted herself by\norganizing a pole- dancing studio in the four- hundred- square- foot\ngarage of the house. She also found her own friends in physical fitness\nand dance groups. She joined a New Age yoga studio called\nPhysical Phatness, as well as a local acrobatic performance group,\nand, on Friday nights, pole danced at the Mercury lounge in downtown\nHonolulu. Unlike Snowden, she enjoyed socializing, writing in\nher blog, “We lovingly crammed a large group into a small corner\nof a delicious Japanese restaurant and filled our bellies with sushi,\ntempura, and good conversation.”\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 41\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n42 | how america lost its secrets\nThat same July, Snowden had other things on his mind, including\nan attempt to advance himself. Although his position at Dell as\na system administrator was a well- compensated one, especially for\na twenty- nine- year- old with no formal education, it carried little\nprestige. He sat from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. in a windowless room\nwatching a bank of monitors in the so- called tunnel. Many of those\nwho worked with him were, as he described them, “eighteen year old\nsoldiers.” Presumably, they had little interest in discussing with him\nthe weightier issues of the world. Working as an outside contractor\nwas also a dead- end job that hardly matched the vision he had of\nhimself in his Internet postings. In real life, in a cubicle in the NSA,\nhe was decidedly not the Wolfking Awesomefox heroic image he had\nof himself in his dream vision.\nSnowden now decided to apply for a position in the NSA itself.\nHe apparently believed that if he scored high enough on its entrance\nexam, the NSA would invite him to join it as a Senior Executive\nService officer, or SES, which was the civilian equivalent in rank and\npay to a flag officer in the U.S. armed forces. “I’m still amazed that\na twenty-eight-year-old thought he could get an SES position,” a\ncivilian contractor working for the NSA during the same period told\nme, “Snowden had a very overinflated view of his self-worth.” To\nenhance his chances of getting the SES job, Snowden in the summer\nof 2012 illicitly hacked into the NSA’s administrative files and stole\nthe answers to the NSA exam. As the NSA’s subsequent postmortem\nwould determine, it was the first known document that Snowden\ntook without authorization at the NSA.\nIt was not the first time, however, that he had used his hacking\nskills to attempt to advance himself. At the CIA in 2009, as he later\nsaid in Moscow, he had added text to his annual CIA evaluation in\nwhat he termed “a non- malicious way” to prove a point. His CIA\nsuperior took a much darker view of that incident when the hack\nwas detected, calling for an investigation. It was the threat of that\ninvestigation that, it will be recalled, in effect ended Snowden’s CIA\ncareer. At the NSA, his intrusion was not detected for almost a year.\n“He stole the [NSA] test with the answers, and he took the test and\nhe aced it,” the former NSA director Michael McConnell recounted\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 42\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThief | 43\nin a 2013 interview. “He then walked into the NSA and said you\nshould hire me because I am this good on the test.”\nThe reason why he attempted to gain entry into the upper ranks\nof the NSA in the late summer of 2012 is less clear. If his Internet\nposting and libertarian riffs are an indication of his state of mind\nthen, he was hostile to the surveillance activities of the NSA. If so, it\nmade little sense that he would seek a permanent career there. If this\nis considered in light of the career move he made six months later\n(in March 2013), which, as he himself admits, was for the express\npurpose of getting at tightly held documents stored on computers\nthat were not available to him in his job at Dell, then he might have\nbeen seeking wider access in 2012 for a more nefarious purpose than\nan NSA job.\nIn any case, despite the near- perfect scores, the NSA did not offer\nhim a Senior Executive Service job. “It was totally unrealistic for\nSnowden to expect to get an SES position,” a former senior NSA\nofficer told me. Snowden’s ambitions might have been disappointed\nin this instance, but it did not prevent him from later claiming that\nhe had been a senior adviser to the CIA and also a senior adviser to\nthe Defense Intelligence Agency.\nInstead of an SES position, the NSA offered him a lowly G- 13 job\nas an information technology worker, which was not an improvement\non his job at Dell. He took this slight as evidence of the NSA’s\nincompetence, subsequently joking to a reporter in Moscow that his\nability to steal the test answers should have been seen as a qualification\nfor the NSA job. In September 2012, he turned down the NSA\noffer. If he was to advance himself now, he had to find a new way.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 43\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nchapter 5\nCrossing the Rubicon\nWhat I came to feel is that a regime that is described as a national\nsecurity agency has stopped representing the public interest and\nhas instead begun to protect and promote state security interests.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2014\nSoon after Snowden failed to get an SES job at the NSA in September\n2012, he intensified his rogue activities. As we’ve seen,\npart of Snowden’s job as a system administrator under contract to\nDell was transferring files held at Fort Meade to backup computers\nin Hawaii. He “was moving copies of that data there for them,” said\nDeputy Director Ledgett, “which was perfect cover for stealing the\n[NSA] data” through the fall and winter of 2012. The security measures\nat the Hawaii base presented no obstacles to him because, as\na system administrator, he had privileges that allowed him to copy\ndocuments that had not been encrypted. Indeed, it was part of the\nprocess of building the backup system. The flaw he had pointed to\nin Japan, in which system administrators working solo could safely\nsteal files, also existed in Hawaii, as we know. This time, however,\ninstead of bringing it to the attention of the NSA, he used it to steal\nfiles.\nSnowden could be confident that his thefts of documents would\ngo undetected. Real- time auditing of the movement of documents,\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 44\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nCrossing the Rubicon | 45\nwhich was done at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade and most of the\nNSA’s regional facilities, had not yet been installed at the Hawaii\nbase, because a lack of bandwidth prevented the safe upgrading of\nthe software. This auditing software was scheduled to be installed\nafter the backup system was completed in 2013. The Kunia base was\none of the last NSA bases that did not monitor suspicious transfers\nof files on a real- time basis. Snowden was aware of this deficiency;\nhe later pointed out in his interview in Wired that the NSA base\nwhere he worked did not have an “audit” mechanism. This security\ngap allowed Snowden, using his system administrator’s credentials,\nto copy classified data to a thumb drive without anyone’s being able\nto trace the copied data back to him. According to the NSA’s subsequent\ndamage assessment, he stole many thousands of pages while\nworking for Dell in 2012 before he contacted journalists. Ledgett\nsubsequently reported that the NSA analysis of the fifty- eight thousand\ndocuments that were given by Snowden to journalists in June\n2013 showed that most of them were taken while he was still working\nat Dell.\nThis theft was made even more serious by the interconnection\nof NSA computers with those of other intelligence agencies. Prior\nto the 9/11 attacks in 2001, “stovepiping” had protected NSA data\non its computers from networks used by other intelligence services.\nAfter the 9/11 Commission concluded that part of the reason U.S.\nintelligence agencies were unable to “connect the dots” in advance of\nthe attack was related to this practice, the NSA stripped away a large\npart of its stovepiping. As a result, the NSANet, which Snowden\nhad access to at Dell in 2012, became a shared network with “common\naccess points,” as the former NSA director Michael Hayden\ndescribed them to me, which made them the equivalent of “reading\nrooms” in a library. They served as a means for NSA workers to\nexchange ideas about the problems they were encountering on various\nprojects for the intelligence community. In maintaining them,\nsystem administrators, or “system admins,” like Snowden, acted as\nthe “librarians.” If a system administrator copied data from this network,\nno one knew.\nFor Snowden, the NSANet, which included CIA and Defense\nDepartment documents, provided a rich hunting ground in the fall\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 45\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n46 | how america lost its secrets\nand winter of 2012. Many of the documents he took off the NSANet\nrevealed operations not only of the NSA but also of the CIA and the\nPentagon. By taking them, he had come to a Rubicon from which\nthere would be no return. He later explained in an e- mail to Vanity\nFair from Moscow, “I crossed that line.”\nAs far as is known, Snowden was not sharing documents with any\nother party prior to May 2013. He was not even yet in contact with\nPoitras, Greenwald, or any other journalists. Presumably, Snowden\nwas collecting them on drives— despite the risks that possessing\nsuch a collection of secrets might entail— for some future use.\nWhy would Snowden jeopardize his career and, if caught, his freedom\nby undertaking this illicit enterprise? He might by now have\nhad strong ideological objections to the NSA’s global surveillance. As\nhe said later in Moscow, “We’re subverting our security standards\nfor the sake of surveillance.” Ordinarily, though, even ideologically\nopposed employees don’t steal state secrets and risk imprisonment.\nIf they are disgruntled, they seek employment elsewhere. Certainly,\nSnowden, with his three years’ experience working for Dell, would\nhave little problem finding a job as an IT worker in the booming\ncivilian sector of computer technology. Instead, he sought to widen\nhis access to NSA documents. This behavior suggests that he might\nhave had another agenda. One possible clue to it is the first document\nhe took: the NSA exam. The answers to the questions in it\nrepresented to him a form of tactical power. Those answers could\nempower him to obtain a more important job in the NSA itself that\nwould allow him to burrow deeper into the executive structure of\nthe agency. Holding such a job would unlock the door to documents\ncontaining the NSA’s sources stored in areas not available to Dell\ncontractors like himself.\nHis later actions demonstrated that he equated the possession of\nsuch secrets with personal power. For example, after he arrived in\nMoscow in 2013, he bragged to James Risen of the Times that he\nhad access to secrets that gave him great leverage over the NSA. He\ntold him specifically his access to “full lists” of the NSA’s agents and\noperations in adversary countries could, if revealed, close down the\nNSA’s capabilities to gather information in them.\nSuch a fascination with the power of government- held secrets\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 46\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nCrossing the Rubicon | 47\nhas always been a core concern of radical Libertarians. In his 1956\nbook, The Torment of Secrecy: The Background and Consequences of\nAmerican Security Policies, the sociologist Edward Shils brilliantly\ndissects the fascination with secrecy among individuals who fear that\ngovernment agencies will use covert machinations against them. In\nShils’s concept, this counterculture is “tormented” by the government’s\npossession of knowledge unavailable to them. Members of\nthis culture tend to believe that the agencies that hold these secrets,\nsuch as the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA, can control their lives; they\nalso believe that obtaining such secrets will give individuals power\nover government.\nSnowden himself was concerned with a coming “dark future,”\nwhich he later described as follows: “[The elites] know everything\nabout us and we know nothing about them— because they are secret,\nthey are privileged, and they are a separate class . . . the elite class,\nthe political class, the resource class— we don’t know where they\nlive, we don’t know what they do, we don’t know who their friends\nare. They have the ability to know all that about us. This is the direction\nof the future but I think there are changing possibilities in this.”\nTo change the “dark future,” someone would have to know the\nsecrets of the “elites.” Snowden saw himself as one of the few individuals\nin a position to seize state secrets from those elites. He had\na SCI (sensitive compartmented information) clearance, a pass into\nan NSA regional base, and the privileges of a system administrator.\nThis position allowed him to steal state secrets and whatever power\nthat went with them. And if he moved to a position that gave him\ngreater access, he would, in this view, amass even greater power.\nWhatever his actual agenda in 2012, we know that he tested possible\nreactions to a leak exposing NSA surveillance in the United\nStates. He asked fellow workers at the NSA base in 2012, according\nto his own account, “What do you think the public would do if this\n[secret data] was on the front page?” He asked this question at a time\nwhen a large number of State Department and U.S. Army classified\ndocuments had been posted on Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks website.\nThese WikiLeaks revelations made, as Snowden knew they would,\nfront- page headlines. His “question” was only rhetorical. No covert\nNSA document had ever been published in the press as of 2012. One\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 47\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n48 | how america lost its secrets\nreason why NSA documents remained secrets, as all intelligence\nworkers at Dell were told when they signed their oath to protect\nNSA secrets, was that the unauthorized release of communications\nintelligence documents would violate U.S. espionage laws. Even so,\nthere was no shortage of activists overseas, such as Assange, who\nwould be willing to publish NSA documents revealing its global surveillance\nactivities. Cyberpunks, as these activists called themselves,\ntended to be hostile to the NSA because they believed (correctly)\nthat it monitored their activities on the Internet. This anti- NSA\nview was well represented at the Chaos Computer Club convention\nin Berlin in 2012. In addressing these cyberpunks, Assange and his\nfollowers at WikiLeaks declared that the main enemy in cyberspace\nwas the NSA. The NSA documents Snowden had taken were far\nmore explosive than anything Assange had posted to date because\nthey contained NSA intelligence source material.\nIn the late fall of 2012, Snowden further tested his newly found\npowers. Using an alias, he reached out to some of the leading hacktivists.\nIt opened a door for him to the darker side of cyberspace.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 48\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nchapter 6\nHacktivist\nWhen you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss gazes into you.\n— friedrich nietzsche\nBy the time that Snowden had begun hacking into NSA files\nin 2012, the alienated hacktivist battling to unlock the secrets\nof evil corporations and governments had become a stock hero of\npopular culture. For example, in the international best- selling Girl\nwith the Dragon Tattoo Trilogy by Stieg Larsson, the heroine, a\nself- educated hacker in her twenties named Lisbeth Salander, steals\nincriminating documents from computers that provide the journalist\nMikael Blomkvist with scoops that save from bankruptcy the progressive\nmagazine he edits. The journalists at the magazine accept\nher sociopathic behavior, which includes embezzling millions of dollars,\nextortion, maiming, and murder, because her hacking exposes\ncrimes and abuses of power. In the real- world universe, hacktivists\nalso use their skills to attempt to redress perceived abuses of power.\nFor example, in December 2010, the group Anonymous, whose\nmembers, called Anons, often wear Guy Fawkes masks resembling\nthose worn in the 2006 movie V for Vendetta, launched a successful\ndenial- of- service attack called Operation Avenge Assange. It was\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 49\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n50 | how america lost its secrets\naimed at paralyzing companies, including PayPal and MasterCard,\nthat refused to process donations for WikiLeaks, which these Anons\nbelieved were stifling the freedom of the Internet. Because hacktivists\noften use illicit means to redress their grievances, such as denialof-\nservice attacks, theft of passwords, and hacking into computers,\nthey must conceal their true identities to avoid the retribution of\nthe FBI and other law enforcement agencies. This requires them to\noperate on the dark side of cyberspace, which has become known as\nthe dark net. Fortunately for hacktivists, the dark net is accessible to\nanyone.\nIt is a place frequented by those who want to avoid laws, regulations,\nand government surveillance. Its denizens include cyber saboteurs,\nindustrial spies, purveyors of illegal contraband, spammers,\npranksters, identity thieves, video pirates, bullies, slanderers, drug\ndealers, child pornographers, money launderers, contract killers,\ninside traders, anarchists, terrorists, and the intelligence services of\nmany countries.\nSue Halpern, writing about it in The New York Review of Books,\nnoted, “My own forays to the dark Net include visits to sites offering\ncounterfeit drivers’ licenses, methamphetamine, a template for\na US twenty- dollar bill, files to make a 3D- printed gun, and books\ndescribing how to receive illegal goods in the mail without getting\ncaught. There were, too, links to rape and child abuse videos.”\nTo operate effectively on the dark net, one often needs a mask\nof anonymity. But it is not easy to completely hide one’s tracks\nin cyberspace. The way that the Internet ordinarily works is that\nwhenever an individual sends e- mails or instant messages or visits\na website, his or her identity can be referenced by the IP address\nassigned to him or her by the Internet service provider. If dark net\nusers’ IP addresses are discoverable, they obviously cannot remain\nanonymous. So, to evade this built- in Internet transparency, dark\nside users have come to rely on ingenious software to hide their\nIP addresses. The most commonly used software for this purpose\nis Tor, which was first called the Onion Router, because it moves IP\naddresses through multiple layers. Tor software hides the IP address\nby routing messages through a network of Tor- enabled relay stations,\ncalled nodes. Each node further obscures the user’s IP, even\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 50\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nHacktivist | 51\nfrom the next node in the network. This scrambling allows messages\nto exit the chain of Tor nodes without an easily discoverable IP. By\ndoing so, it “anomizes” each user of the dark side.\nBecause of the anonymity it provides, Tor became the software of\nchoice for individuals and organizations who wanted to hide their\nidentities. For example, Tor software made possible Silk Road, which\nacted as an exchange for drug dealers, assassins, safecrackers, and\nprostitutes until it was closed down by the FBI in 2013. It was created\nby Ross Ulbricht, a Libertarian who wore a Ron Paul T- shirt,\nas a website where “people could buy anything anonymously, with\nno trail whatsoever that led back to them.” (Ulbricht received a life\nsentence for running this criminal enterprise in May 2015.)\nTor software was also employed by Private Bradley Manning\n(now Chelsea Manning) to transfer some fifty thousand diplomatic\ncables and military reports from his laptop to Assange’s WikiLeaks\nwebsite. Eventually, Manning was identified by a fellow hacker, convicted\nby a military court for violations of the Espionage Act, and\nsentenced to thirty- five years in prison. Tor enabled WikiLeaks to\npublish other secret data, such as material acquired in the theft of\nSony’s files, allegedly by the North Korean intelligence service, in\n2015. It was the means for guaranteeing anonymity to the IT workers\nwho responded to Assange’s by now famous clarion call to unite.\nIt allowed system administrators who opposed the “surveillance\nstate,” as well as other disgruntled employees of government agencies\nor corporations, to send documents they copied to the WikiLeaks\nwebsite without revealing their IP addresses.\nBecause WikiLeaks did not know the identity of its sources, it\ncould not be legally compelled to reveal them. “Tor’s importance\nto WikiLeaks cannot be overstated,” Assange said in an interview\nwith Rolling Stone in 2012. Indeed, without the anonymity provided\nby its Tor software, WikiLeaks could not have easily entered into a\ndocument- sharing arrangement with major newspapers, including\nThe Guardian, The New York Times, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, and El\nPaís. Through the magic of Tor, these newspapers simply attribute\ntheir sources to WikiLeaks, which, in turn, made Assange a major\nforce in international journalism.\nIronically, Tor was a creation of U.S. intelligence. In the early years\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 51\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n52 | how america lost its secrets\nof the twenty- first century, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and\nthe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency developed it to\nallow American intelligence operatives to cloak their movements on\nthe Internet. They could anonymously manipulate websites operated\nby Islamic radicals, for example, and create their own Trojan\nhorse sites to lure would- be terrorists and spies. As it turned out,\nthat use of Tor software had a conceptual flaw. If U.S. intelligence\nservices used it, the targets could figure out that anyone visiting a\nsite without an IP address was using Tor software to hide it. If Tor\nwas exclusively used by U.S. intelligence services, the targets could\nfurther deduce that all the anonymous visitors were avatars for\nAmerican intelligence. It would be analogous to undercover police\nusing pink- colored cars that civilians did not use.\nTo remedy this flaw, the U.S. government made Tor software open\nsource in 2008 and freely available to everyone in the world. It even\nprovided funding for its promulgation, with the State Department,\nthe National Science Foundation, and the Broadcasting Board of\nGovernors financing Tor’s core developer. The public rationale for\nthis generosity was that Tor could serve as a tool for, as the State\nDepartment called it, “democracy advocates in authoritarian states.”\nWhile Tor software remained a useful tool in covert operations by\nthe CIA, the DIA, and the FBI, it was anathema to the NSA because\nit made it more difficult for it to track potential targets.\nAs Tor software became widely used by adversaries (as well as\ncommon criminals), the NSA sought to find vulnerabilities in it. “It\nshould hardly be surprising that our intelligence agencies seek ways\nto counteract targets that use Tor software to hide their communications,”\nexplained an NSA spokesperson. The NSA’s adversaries also\ntook an interest in identifying Tor users because they might include\npolitical dissidents and potential spies.\nTor software also took on a cultlike importance to hacktivists concerned\nwith the U.S. government’s tracking their activities. Catherine\nA. Fitzpatrick provides an illuminating insight into the mind- set of\nthese hacktivists in her 2014 book, Privacy for Me and Not for Thee.\nShe describes them as largely “radical anarchists” who believe “the\nstate is all- powerful, that law- enforcement is so strong that it will\nprevail anyway, and that they are a persecuted minority.” As a refuge\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 52\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nHacktivist | 53\nagainst the surveillance of the state, and in particular the NSA, they\nnot only attempt to hide their own identities but also use encryption\nto obscure their messages. Their goal is to free their movements “of\nany interference from law- enforcement.” In this mind- set, according\nto Fitzpatrick, “they believe government intelligence agencies\nwill stop at nothing to stop them from absolute encryption.”\nTor software was a means to defeat the NSA, but for it to be successful,\nthere needed to be such a proliferation of Tor servers that\nthe NSA could not piece together IP addresses. The problem was that\nthe Tor Project, as they called it, was still a very tiny operation in\n2012. It employed fewer than a hundred core developers, who were\nlocated mainly in Germany, Iceland, Japan, Estonia, and the United\nStates. Its staff worked mainly out of a single room in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts.\nThe guiding spirit behind the Tor movement in the private sector\nwas Jacob Appelbaum, a charismatic twenty- eight- year- old who had\ngrown up in Northern California. Like Snowden, he had dropped\nout of high school. Appelbaum identified himself to his followers on\nthe Internet as a “hacktivist” battling state surveillance. For him, as\nfor many in the hacktivist culture, the main enemy was the NSA.\nAfter all, the NSA had a vast army of computer scientists working\nto defeat Tor software. Appelbaum was well connected in this culture,\nhaving been the North American representative for WikiLeaks\nbefore he moved to Berlin in 2013. He also managed WikiLeaks’s\ncyber security when it released the classified documents it obtained\nfrom Manning in 2010. He was so well regarded among hacktivists\nthat Assange chose him as his keynote speaker replacement at\nthe Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) convention in New York City.\nAssange told Rolling Stone, “Jake [Appelbaum] has been a tireless\npromoter behind the scenes of our cause.” For its part, Rolling Stone\ntitled its profile of Appelbaum “Meet the Most Dangerous Man in\nCyberspace.” (Assange needed a replacement for this particular event\nbecause he feared if he came to New York, he would be arrested for\nreleasing the Manning files on WikiLeaks.)\nIn Berlin, Appelbaum went to extreme lengths to protect himself\nfrom American surveillance. For example, when George Packer\ninterviewed him for The New Yorker in 2014, he insisted on meet-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 53\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n54 | how america lost its secrets\ning with Packer naked in a sauna so he could be sure Packer did not\nhave a recording device (other than his notebook). Appelbaum stated\nrepeatedly in interviews that he was being spied upon by America.\nWhile his claims might have sounded paranoid to his interviewers,\nas a character in Joseph Heller’s Catch- 22 famously said, “Just\nbecause you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they aren’t after you.”\nRuna Sandvik, a close associate of Appelbaum’s, also worked\ntirelessly to extend Tor’s cloak of anonymity in the private sector\nagainst the surveillance of the NSA and other would- be intruders\nof privacy. A Norwegian national in her mid- twenties, she wrote a\nwell- followed blog on Internet privacy for Forbes in 2012, in which\nshe identified herself as a privacy and security researcher working\nat the intersection of technology, law, and policy. Appelbaum and\nSandvik both came in contact with Snowden before he went public\nand while he was still working for the NSA in Hawaii.\nIn 2012, Snowden become involved in the effort to encourage\nthe use of Tor software to protect privacy. He made no secret of his\nconcerns about electronic interceptions. According to an anonymous\nco- worker, he even wore a jacket to work with a parody of the\nNSA insignia, which, instead of merely depicting the NSA eagle,\nshowed the eagle clutching AT&T phone lines. He had also become\na member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital rights\norganization that was helping finance Tor. He saw Tor software as a\nremedy. “Without Tor,” he later wrote, “when you walk the streets\nof the Internet, you’re always watched.” His efforts on behalf of Tor\nwere not limited to symbolic gestures. In 2012, he set up a twogigabyte\nserver called “The Signal,” which he described as the largest\nTor relay station exit node in Honolulu. He apparently paid for\nit himself.\nThrough his work as a system administrator for Dell, he found\ndocuments revealing NSA efforts, not yet successful, to defeat Tor’s\nability to camouflage a user’s identity on the Internet. He found that\nthe NSA was attempting to build backdoor entry ways into Tor software.\nOne of the NSA documents that he illicitly downloaded, titled\n“Tor Stinks,” described the agency’s continuing efforts to penetrate\nTor servers. In addition, he downloaded NSA documents describing\nprograms begun in 2012 that aimed at searching the Internet for the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 54\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nHacktivist | 55\ncyber signatures of foreign parties suspected of hacking into U.S.\ngovernment systems.\nHe also made efforts to directly contact Sandvik. She recalls\nfirst hearing from Snowden in November 2012. He first wrote to\nher under the alias Cincinnatus but later supplied his real name\nand mailing address in Hawaii because he wanted her to mail him\nauthentic computer stickers from the Tor Project that he could use\nas “swag,” as he wrote her, to attract further interest in Tor software\nin Hawaii. As a result, she knew his identity seven months before he\nwent public in Hong Kong. He would later tell Sandvik from Moscow\nthat he had been “moonlighting” by working to advance the Tor\nProject. He added, with some understatement, that his moonlighting\nwas “something the NSA might not have been too happy about.”\nOn November 18, 2012, while still working for Dell at the NSA,\nhis dual role led him to begin organizing a “CryptoParty” aimed at\nfinding new recruits for Tor. The CryptoParty movement had been\nstarted in 2012 by Asher Wolf, a radical hacktivist and anarchist living\nin Melbourne, Australia. She promoted the get- togethers not\nunlike the Tupperware parties of the 1950s. The party organizer,\nusually with a representative of the Tor Project, advertised the party\non the Internet. Attendees were encouraged to bring their own laptops\nso they could install Tor as well as encryption software in them.\nThe attendees would then be instructed on how to use it. Finally,\nthose converted to Tor software would be told to proselytize about\nits virtues by holding their own CryptoParty. Wolf’s idea was to use\nthese gatherings to expand the realm of Tor.\nSnowden called his fete the Oahu CryptoParty. It had its own web\npage. He told Wolf that it would be the first CryptoParty in Honolulu.\nShe wrote back advising him to “keep it simple.” (Wolf later\nsaid she did not know he was working at the NSA.)\nSnowden apparently had no inhibitions in staging a party that the\nleadership of the NSA might consider subversive of its battle against\nTor. He even invited fellow NSA workers in Hawaii, as well as others\nin the local computer culture. He asked Sandvik, who was living in\nWashington, D.C., at the time, to participate, proposing that she cohost\nthe party with him. He scheduled it for December 11, 2012, in\nHonolulu. According to Sandvik’s account, Snowden informed her\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 55\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n56 | how america lost its secrets\nthat he “had been talking some of the more technical guys at work\ninto setting up some additional fast servers” for Tor. His “work”\nplace at the time was the NSA. So, if he was telling the truth, he\nhad already attempted to find co- workers at the NSA who might be\ninterested in attending an anti- NSA surveillance presentation.\nSandvik not only agreed to be Snowden’s co- presenter but made\nthe Oahu CryptoParty a Tor- sponsored event. Sandvik flew to\nHonolulu on December 6, 2012. It was a fourteen- hour flight and\na relatively expensive one. She later told Wired magazine that the\ninvitation from Snowden coincided with her plan to take a “vacation\nin Hawaii.” Whatever her reason, it brought her in direct contact\nwith a Tor supporter with access to the computers of its main enemy,\nthe NSA.\nOn December 11, following Snowden’s instructions, Sandvik\narrived shortly before 6:00 p.m. at the Fishcake gallery in downtown\nHonolulu. She proceeded through a maze of furniture display rooms\nto BoxJelly, a public space. She was then directed to a small back room\nin which there were folding chairs and worktables already set up for\nthe event. Rechung Fujihira, the owner of BoxJelly, told me that Hi\nCapacity, a “creative collective” of computer buffs, had arranged the\nlogistics for the event. As he recalled, Snowden had requested their\nhelp for the CryptoParty.\nSandvik found Snowden waiting for her with Lindsay Mills,\nwhom he introduced to Sandvik as his girlfriend. He told Sandvik\nthat Mills was there to make a video of the event. Mills did not mention\nthe party in her blog. But that Snowden brought her and introduced\nher to Sandvik suggests that he did not keep secret from her\nhis activities to further Tor.\nThe event started at 6:00 p.m. sharp. By Sandvik’s count, about\ntwenty people gradually filled the room. She reckoned that about\nhalf of the attendees were from Snowden’s workplace. Snowden\nbegan the presentation by giving reasons why Internet users needed\nto defend their privacy by using both encryption and Tor software.\nAccording to one attendee who asked not to be identified by name,\nSnowden, while not revealing that he worked for the NSA, spoke\nwith such precise knowledge about government surveillance capabilities\nthat the attendee suspected Snowden worked for the govern-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 56\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nHacktivist | 57\nment. Snowden next introduced Sandvik, who took the podium and\ndiscussed the work of the Tor Project, stressing the importance of\nexpanding the Tor network. Following their presentations, Snowden\nand Sandvik took questions from the audience.\nThe Oahu CryptoParty, according to Sandvik, ended about\n10:00 p.m. No one objected to Mills’s making a video of the meeting,\neven though it was dedicated to the idea of protecting personal\nprivacy. The video was not posted on the Internet, so presumably\nSnowden wanted it for his own purposes. Afterward, Sandvik went\nto a local diner called Zippy’s for a late dinner. She left Hawaii two\ndays later.\nNot all the hacktivists that Snowden invited were able to attend.\nParker Higgins, for example, a prime mover in the Electronic Frontier\nFoundation and founder of the San Francisco CryptoParty, wrote\nback to him that he was unable to attend the December CryptoParty\nbecause of the high price of the airfare that month between San Francisco\nand Honolulu. He added that he would try to attend Snowden’s\nnext CryptoParty, which was scheduled for February 23, 2013. (Higgins\nwould make headlines in 2013 by flying a chartered blimp over\nthe NSA’s secret facility in Utah and photographing it from the air.)\nSnowden’s double duty continued: downloading secret documents\nwhile remaining in touch with some of the leading figures\nin the Tor Project under his various aliases. He also continued to\ninvite activists to his CryptoParties, and he openly advertised them\non the Internet until 2013. The CIA’s former deputy director Morell,\nwho reviewed the security situation at the NSA in 2014 as a member\nof President Obama’s NSA Review Committee, found that the\nNSA in the post– Cold War age had encouraged its technical workers\nto freely discuss challenges that arose in its computer operations.\n“The idea was to spread knowledge and learn from the successes\nof others,” Morell wrote, “but it created enormous security vulnerability,\ngiven the always- existent risk of an insider committed to\nstealing secrets.” According to a former intelligence executive, this\nnew “open culture,” exemplified by largely unrestricted entry to the\nNSANet by civilian contractors, fit the culture of the young civilians\non the “geek squads” who now ran the NSA’s computer networks.\nIt was remarkable that even in such an “open culture,” Snowden’s\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 57\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n58 | how america lost its secrets\nCryptoParty, Tor station, and other anti- NSA activities could go\nunremarked upon. After all, ten or so NSA workers attended the\nfirst party, and it is not unlikely that many of them recognized\nhim as their co- worker. If so, they knew (as did Sandvik and Mills)\nthat the Tor advocate “Cincinnatus” was Snowden. He had also not\nbeen shy in contacting notable enemies of the NSA via e- mail, such\nas Jacob Appelbaum, Parker Higgins, and Asher Wolf. If anyone,\nincluding the security staff of the NSA, had been on the lookout for\ndissident intelligence workers, this well- advertised gathering and its\norganizer might have been of interest.\nIn 2014, I asked a former top NSA executive whether such activities\non behalf of Tor by an NSA employee would arouse the attention\nof the NSA’s own “Q” counterespionage unit. He answered,\n“Snowden was not an NSA employee.” Because Snowden was a\ncontract employee of Dell’s residing in the United States, the NSA\ncould not legally monitor his private activities or intercept his communication.\nTo do so would require a court- approved FBI request. So\nSnowden/Cincinnatus was free to operate openly in recruiting NSA\nworkers, hacktivists, and computer buffs for his events. Ironically,\nadversary intelligence services searching for disgruntled intelligence\nworkers had no such constraints.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 58\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nchapter 7\nString Puller\nIt wasn’t that they put it on me as an individual— that I’m uniquely\nqualified [or] an angel descending from the heavens— as that they\nput it on someone, somewhere.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2013\nDownloading NSA documents was not Snowden’s only rogue\nactivity while working at the NSA for Dell in 2012. Three\nweeks after the CryptoParty, Snowden began anonymously contacting\na high- profile journalist. He used the same alias, Cincinnatus,\nthat he used with Sandvik and to advertise the Oahu CryptoParty.\nThe journalist to whom he wrote on December 1, 2012, was Glenn\nGreenwald, the previously mentioned Rio- based columnist for The\nGuardian.\nGreenwald had not always been an activist journalist. He had\nbeen a litigation lawyer at the elite New York firm of Wachtell, Lipton,\nRosen & Katz. He was also an entrepreneur, owning part of\nMaster Notions, a company that, among other things, had a 50 percent\nfinancial interest in the pornographic website HJ (an acronym\nthat originally stood for “Hairy Jock”). All did not go well with this\nenterprise. In 2004, Greenwald became involved in an acrimonious\nlawsuit with his other associates in HJ. As a result, he had a number\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 59\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n60 | how america lost its secrets\nof open legal judgments filed against him, including an $85,000 lien\nby the IRS.\nAfter resigning from his law firm in 2005, he moved to Rio de\nJaneiro and began a new career as a blogger for the Internet magazine\nSalon. He wrote fierce, and often brilliant, polemics against U.S.\ngovernment surveillance and other perceived intrusions on personal\nprivacy. The extent of his bitter antagonism toward the activities of\nthe “surveillance state,” as he called it, was reflected in the title of\nhis 2006 book, How Would a Patriot Act? Defending American Values\nfrom a President Run Amok. His position on surveillance was\nunrelenting, even when it came to the president. “By ordering illegal\neavesdropping, the president had committed crimes and should be\nheld accountable for them,” Greenwald wrote. When Barack Obama\nbecame president in 2009, Greenwald also attacked him for breaking\nthe law by “ordering illegal eavesdropping.” Because of his opposition\nto Obama, he contributed money to the libertarian campaign of\nRon Paul, the same candidate to whom Snowden gave money.\nIn August 2012, he had transferred his provocative blog, which\nhad amassed a following of nearly one million readers (including\nSnowden), from Salon to The Guardian. The British newspaper\nshared his powerful anti- surveillance position, having first published\nthe WikiLeaks documents that had been illicitly leaked by Manning\nand published by Assange in 2010.\nGreenwald was an activist as well as a journalist. He joined the\nboard of directors of the Freedom of the Press Foundation (eventually\nRuna Sandvik would join too). It had been set up expressly to\nfunnel money to both Assange’s WikiLeaks site and the defense fund\nfor Manning after he was arrested. Such a financial intermediary\nwas necessary because American credit card companies were blocking\nmoney transfers to these two causes in 2012. This “blockade”\nwas taking its toll on WikiLeaks. According to Assange, “WikiLeaks\nhad been cut off from more than 90 percent of its finances.” The\nFreedom of the Press Foundation came to its rescue. John Perry Barlow,\none of the songwriters for the Grateful Dead, was one of its\nchief financial backers. “The first serious info war is now engaged,”\nBarlow declared. “The field of battle is WikiLeaks.” He served with\nGreenwald and Poitras on its board.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 60\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nString Puller | 61\nSnowden was an avid reader of Greenwald’s screeds against the\ngovernment. If he were to assume the role of a modern- day Prometheus,\ndelivering forbidden NSA secrets to the public, Greenwald\nwould be a logical candidate to break the story. Snowden could safely\nassume that Greenwald would be sympathetic to exposing NSA surveillance\nfrom his many blogs, tweets, and YouTube comments on\nthe subject. For example, on November 13, 2012, just eighteen days\nbefore Snowden contacted him, Greenwald had written a blog for\nThe Guardian asserting that the United States was “a surveillance\nstate run amok.” In it, echoing very closely what Snowden said at his\nCryptoParty, Greenwald wrote, “Any remnants of internet anonymity\nhave been all but obliterated between the state and technology\ncompanies.” Citing a story in The Washington Post, he continued,\n“Every day, collection systems at the National Security Agency\nintercept and store 1.7 billion e- mails, phone calls and other types\nof communications.”\nAs a result, Greenwald called for action in that blog posting, writing,\n“The US operates a sprawling, unaccountable Surveillance State\nthat, in violent breach of the core guarantees of the Fourth Amendment,\nmonitors and records virtually everything even the most\nlaw- abiding citizens do.” That same week, Snowden invited Runa\nSandvik to co- host his CryptoParty.\nOne problem for Snowden in reaching out to Greenwald was\nGreenwald’s lack of any encryption for his e- mails. Communicating\nwith a journalist like Greenwald who famously attacked the very\norganization for which Snowden worked was itself a risky undertaking,\nespecially if he wanted to pass classified NSA documents to\nhim. If his e- mails were intercepted by the NSA in Brazil (where\nGreenwald lived) and where the NSA was not restricted by U.S. law,\nhe could lose his job or even be arrested. As Cincinnatus, he told\nGreenwald that he needed to immediately encrypt his computer. To\nmake his point, he cited Greenwald’s November 12, 2012, blog. In it,\nGreenwald noted that General David Petraeus, then the CIA director,\nhad been caught in a sex scandal because his personal e- mails\nhad been intercepted. Snowden wrote to Greenwald that Petraeus\nwould not have been exposed if he had used encryption. Snowden\nsent Greenwald instructions on how to install the necessary encryp-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 61\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n62 | how america lost its secrets\ntion software and a link to a twelve- minute video on encryption\n(which might have been the same video he used at his CryptoParty\na few weeks earlier).\nGreenwald did not manage to encrypt his computer, however,\nand Snowden, unwilling to deal with Greenwald through an unencrypted\nchannel, broke off contact with him in January 2013. Even\nso, he did not give up his plan of using Greenwald in his enterprise.\nHe merely sought an intermediary who used encryption.\nHe chose Laura Poitras. He knew she and Greenwald were founding\nboard members of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Greenwald\nhad written about her extensively. For example, he wrote an\nentire blog about her confrontation with the U.S. government and\nher plans to make a documentary about the “US Government’s\nincreasing powers of domestic surveillance [through] its expanding\ncovert domestic NSA activities.”\nSince 2011, Poitras had been diligently filming the construction\nof a massive NSA repository for data in Bluffdale, Utah. In the antisurveillance\nculture, the structure had become symbolic of the powers\nof the NSA. In fact, it was the same NSA site that Parker Higgins\nphotographed from a blimp in the fall of 2013 and posted on the\nInternet after Poitras had released her documentary about the NSA’s\nuse of the Bluffdale repository for domestic spying.\nAside from her connections with Greenwald, Poitras had other\nimpressive credentials. Born in 1964 in Boston, she came from a\nwealthy family that donated large sums of money to philanthropic\ncauses, including $20 million for research on bipolar disorders. After\ngraduating from the New School for Public Engagement in 1996,\nshe pursued a career as an activist filmmaker. Her focus quickly\nbecame exposing NSA surveillance. One of her short documentaries\nabout the NSA’s domestic surveillance program was featured on the\nNew York Times website and attracted enormous attention in 2012.\nAs a dedicated opponent of the surveillance state, she participated\nin public events with William Binney, the ex- NSA whistle- blower,\nand Jacob Appelbaum. In April 2012, for example, she made a presentation\nat the Whitney Museum in New York with Binney and\nAppelbaum. She had become such a leading activist against the NSA\nby December 2012 that Appelbaum, after lauding her work, inter-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 62\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nString Puller | 63\nspersed clips from her short film in his keynote address at the Chaos\nComputer Club convention of hacktivists in Berlin that month.\nSnowden also closely followed her rise in this world. By simply\ngoogling Poitras’s name in January 2013, he would have learned\nabout her connections with Greenwald, Appelbaum, Binney,\nAssange, and other leading figures in the anti- surveillance camp.\nWhen asked later by Poitras why he had chosen her to help him,\nSnowden replied, “I didn’t. You chose yourself.” The problem for\nSnowden was anonymously drawing her into his enterprise.\nPoitras was living in Berlin in January 2013, which made her vulnerable\nto NSA surveillance. To get to her through an encrypted\nchannel, Snowden chose a circuitous approach. On January 11, he\nwrote to Micah Lee in Berkeley, California. Given Lee’s residence\nin the United States, as Snowden knew, the NSA would be legally\nbarred from monitoring his communications without a warrant.\nHe used Lee, who was the chief technology officer at the Freedom\nof the Press Foundation, as the encrypted gateway to Poitras. Lee\nwas also well- connected to others whom Snowden had contacted\nfor his CryptoParty. Lee had been an associate of Runa Sandvik’s at\nTor and was a prominent member of Noisebridge, an eclectic antigovernment\nhackers’ commune based in Northern California, of\nwhich Appelbaum was also a member.\nTo contact Lee, Snowden chose the alias Anon108. Anon is an\nalias frequently used by members of the Anonymous commune\nof hacktivists. “I’m a friend,” Snowden wrote to Lee. “I need to get\ninformation securely to Laura Poitras and her alone, but I can’t find\nan email gpg key for her.” The “gpg” encryption key he asked for,\nmore commonly called a PGP key, was the so- called public key for\nan encryption system called Pretty Good Privacy, or, for short, PGP.\nThis encryption system required both a public and a private key.\nSnowden asked Lee to provide the former one, because Poitras had\nthe latter one. Lee wrote to Poitras about Anon108. The next day,\nwith the approval of Poitras, Lee supplied Poitras’s public key to\nSnowden, or, as he knew him, Anon108.\nWith it, Snowden contacted Poitras directly. He asked her as a first\nstep to open an anonymous e- mail account using Tor software. Poitras\nlater wrote about this initial contact, “I was at that point film-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 63\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n64 | how america lost its secrets\ning with several people who were all being targeted by the [U.S.]\ngovernment.” Many of the people she was filming, including Appelbaum,\nAssange, Binney, and the former NSA employee Thomas\nDrake, could attract interest by U.S. or foreign intelligence services.\nSnowden asked Poitras to take out a new enciphering key to use\nexclusively for her liaison with him. It provided them both with an\nextra layer of protection from any surveillance by law enforcement.\nPresumably, she accommodated his requests because she anticipated\nthat the anonymous person would use this encrypted channel to\nsend her highly sensitive material.\nOn January 23, Snowden wrote to Poitras under yet another alias.\nThis time he called himself Citizen Four. He wrote, “At this stage I\ncan offer nothing more than my word.” He then said falsely, “I am\na senior government employee in the intelligence community.” She\nhad no way of knowing at this “stage” that despite giving her his\n“word,” he was not who he claimed to be. He was not a “government\nemployee,” he was not a “senior” official, and he was not a member\nof the “intelligence community” (which is composed of the intelligence\nservices of the U.S. government). He would later also claim\nto her that he had been “a senior adviser to the CIA” and “a senior\nadviser to the DIA.” That was untrue, too. In January 2013, he was\nmerely a contract employee of Dell’s working as a computer technician\nat the NSA base in Hawaii.\nSnowden told her in his initial e- mail that he was well acquainted\nwith her career as an anti- surveillance activist. He said that he had\nread Greenwald’s account in Salon that past April, a blog in which\nGreenwald detailed the forty times in which Poitras was searched by\nU.S. authorities. The story also said that Poitras believed she was on\na special watch list and under constant U.S. government surveillance.\nShe had come under such scrutiny by U.S. authorities, it turned out,\nbecause of her documentary about American military abuses of civilians\nin Iraq in 2006, titled My Country, My Country. While filming\nit, she was at a place close to an insurgent ambush of U.S. troops in\nIraq. Her presence at the ambush site led army intelligence officers\nto suspect (without any evidence) that she might have been tipped\noff by the insurgents. She firmly denied the charge, and the government\nnever substantiated it. Even so, because of this incident, since\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 64\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nString Puller | 65\n2006 she had been kept on a list that caused authorities to search her\nat airports. As a result, she took elaborate countermeasures to evade\nany possible surveillance of her communications.\nSnowden knew about this incident because Greenwald described\nit in great detail in a blog that Snowden read (as he later told Greenwald).\n“Poitras is now forced to take extreme steps— ones that hamper\nher ability to do her work,” Greenwald wrote. “She now avoids\ntraveling with any electronic devices. She uses alternative methods\nto deliver the most sensitive parts of her work— raw film and interview\nnotes— to secure locations. She spends substantial time and\nresources protecting her computers with encryption and password\ndefenses. Especially when she is in the US, she avoids talking on\nthe phone about her work, particularly to sources. And she simply\nwill not edit her films at her home out of fear— obviously well\ngrounded— that government agents will attempt to search and seize\nthe raw footage.” She claimed, as she told journalists, she was the\nvictim of “Kafkaesque government harassment.”\nSnowden was duly impressed with her concerns about government\nsurveillance, which he agreed was ubiquitous. Indeed, he later\ndescribed her as “more paranoid when it comes to electronic security\nthan I can be.” He meant it as a compliment. Such functional paranoia\nor “operational security,” as Greenwald would call the precautions\nthat she took, dovetailed with Snowden’s growing conviction\nthat universal encryption was necessary to defeat the surveillance\nstate. It also made her the perfect channel for Snowden to safely pass\nsome of the classified documents he stole to Greenwald and other\njournalists.\nIt was not difficult to get her to cooperate in his plot. He wrote,\nfor example, “The surveillance you’ve experienced means you have\nbeen ‘selected’— a term which will mean more to you as you learn\nhow the modern SIGINT [signals intelligence] system works.” Just\nas she had been “chosen” by her work to act as his conduit, according\nto Snowden, she had been chosen by the NSA as a target because\nof her work. The idea of her being “selected” by an invisible signals\nintelligence agency, the NSA, could only excite her longtime concerns\nabout being watched by the government.\n“Your victimization by the NSA system means that you are well\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 65\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n66 | how america lost its secrets\naware of the threat that [the NSA’s] unrestricted, secret abilities pose\nfor democracies,” he continued. “I hope you understand that contacting\nyou is extremely high risk and if you are willing to agree\nto the following precautions before I share more, this will not be a\nwaste of your time.” Further playing on her concern, he asked her to\nconfirm to him “that no one has ever had a copy of your private key\nand that it uses a strong pass phrase.” Such precautions were necessary\nbecause “your adversary is capable of one trillion guesses per\nsecond.” That “adversary” was, as she knew from her previous film,\nthe NSA. At this point, she knew she was entering into a dangerous\nliaison with an unknown party in pursuit of NSA secrets. She wondered\nif he might be part of a plan to entrap her or her contacts like\nAssange and Appelbaum, as she noted in her diary. “Is C4 a trap?”\nshe asked herself, referring to her Citizen Four source. “Will he put\nme in prison?”\nTo elude this “adversary,” Snowden stressed to Poitras that she\nwould have to adopt a conspiratorial frame of mind. “If the device\nyou store the private key and enter your pass phrase on has been\nhacked, it is trivial to decrypt our communications,” he explained. “If\nyou publish the source material, I will likely be immediately implicated.”\nIf her correspondent could be “immediately implicated,” it\nmeant that he was a person authorized to handle these secrets. So\nPoitras knew, as early as January 2013, that she was creating an\nencrypted channel for someone with access to NSA secrets who\nwould be incriminated by providing them to her.\nThe key source for Poitras’s previously referred to short video\nwas Binney. Like her new source, he had been authorized to handle\nNSA secrets. Binney had been an NSA technical director until he\nhad retired in 2001. The NSA’s domestic surveillance program that\nBinney told the press about years before being interviewed in Poitras’s\nfilm was called Stellarwind. It involved data mining domestic\ncommunications and financial transactions that had been authorized\nby President George W. Bush in 2001 after 9/11 as commander- inchief\nunder the war powers given to him following the attacks. It\nindeed led to a major exposé on domestic spying by The New York\nTimes in December 2005.\nBinney had never provided Poitras with any NSA documents\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 66\n9/30/16 11:09 AM\nString Puller | 67\nto back up the charges he made that Stellarwind was an unlawful\ndomestic surveillance operation. He could not have done so without\nviolating his sworn oath and, for that matter, U.S. anti- espionage\nstatutes. Binney made it clear to her and other journalists that he\nwas not a lawbreaker. But her new source, C4, was willing to do\nwhat Binney (and other insiders) had refused to do. He was offering\nin these e- mails to provide her with secret government documents,\neven though it would implicate him as an outlaw. To further\nwhet her appetite, he told her that these up- to- date NSA documents\nwould fully substantiate the allegations that Binney made in her\nfilm. Even more important, he said Binney’s 2001 disclosures were\nstill relevant to her cause. “What you know as Stellarwind has\ngrown,” he wrote to her. “The expanded special source operations\nthat took over Stellarwind’s share of the pie have spread all over the\nworld to practically include comprehensive coverage of the United\nStates.” In fact, as Snowden knew from the Inspector General report\nhe had read, the NSA had terminated Stellarwind almost a decade\nearlier. President Bush ended it after top officials of the Justice\nDepartment insisted that he did not have the legal authority for the\ndomestic part of Stellarwind. Instead, he asked Congress to revise\nFISA to meet the objections of the Justice Department. The result\nwas the FISA Amendment Act of 2006. Unlike the previous Stellarwind\nprogram, it did not permit domestic surveillance. It specified\nthat the government could not target any person in the United\nStates or anywhere else in the world under this authority. Nor could\nit target any foreign person, even one residing outside of the United\nStates, to acquire information from a particular known person inside\nthe United States. As the act recognized that information about U.S.\ncitizens might mistakenly be intercepted by the NSA, it required\nthat such data about Americans be expunged in a bimonthly review\nby a Justice Department task force. Although the NSA program in\nplace in 2013 was not the comprehensive domestic surveillance that\nSnowden claimed it to be, Poitras had no way of knowing at this\nearly state that her source was misleading her.\nHe offered to substantiate her worst fears about the growth of\nNSA surveillance: “I know the location of most domestic interception\npoints, and that the largest telecommunication companies in the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 67\n9/30/16 11:09 AM\n68 | how america lost its secrets\nUS are betraying the trust of their customers, which I can prove.”\nHe even proffered evidence implicating President Barack Obama in\nillegal surveillance. “There is a detailed policy framework, a kind of\nmartial law for cyber operations, created by the White House. It’s\ncalled presidential policy 20,” he wrote to her. It was an eighteenpage\ndirective that Obama had signed four months earlier in October\n2012. Snowden was offering to reveal to her up- to- date evidence\nof a surveillance state in America presided over by the president\nhimself. It was what she had been searching for over the past three\nyears. How could she, as an activist filmmaker, resist such a sensational\noffer?\nHe further explained to her that he had placed great trust in her\ndiscretion. “No one, not even my most trusted confidante, is aware\nof my intentions, and it would not be fair for them to fall under suspicion\nfor my actions,” he said.\nPoitras must have found it flattering that a total stranger was\nwilling to disclose to her in e- mails what he would not tell even his\n“most trusted confidante” about his intentions to commit an illicit\nbreach of U.S. national security. It also put her under enormous\nstress. She noted in her journal that the pressure made her feel as if\nshe were “underwater.” “I am battling with my nervous system. It\ndoesn’t let me rest or sleep. Eye twitches, clenched throat, and now\nliterally waiting to be raided.”\nSnowden was also taking an extraordinary risk. After all, he had\nno way of knowing who else she told about him. She had long been\nconcerned, with good reason, that the U.S. government was out to\nget her. An unknown person offering to supply her with secret documents\ncould be attempting to entrap her. So Snowden could not preclude\nthe possibility that she would consult with others about the\noffer he was making her. Because her current documentary project\nincluded interviews by her with Assange, Appelbaum, and three ex-\nNSA executives, intelligence services with sophisticated surveillance\ncapabilities might also have taken a professional interest in her communications,\nas Poitras herself had suspected. Even if Snowden was\nsomehow able to use his position as a system administrator at Dell\nto ascertain that the NSA did not have Poitras under surveillance, he\ncould not be sure that other agencies, such as the Russian and Chi-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 68\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nString Puller | 69\nnese intelligence services, were not monitoring his communications\nwith her. It was, however, a chance Snowden was willing to take.\nSnowden, in any case, did not intend to conceal his identity for\nmore than a few months. He told Poitras he had a specific purpose\nin allowing her to name him in her ongoing film project. Indeed,\nhe said it was essential in his plan to prevent others, including presumably\nhis “most trusted confidante,” from being suspected by law\nenforcement of helping him in his enterprise. He prevailed on her\nto accommodate his plan, saying, “You may be the only one who\ncan prevent that, and that is by immediately nailing me to the cross\nrather than trying to protect me as a source.” His choice of the imagery\nof crucifixion suggested that like Jesus Christ he was willing to\nsacrifice himself for the sake of others.\nIn keeping with their operational security arrangement, Snowden\nsaid that he would first send her an encrypted file of documents that\nshe would not be able to read. Only after his conditions were met and\n“everything else is done,” he said, “the key will follow.” He was now\npulling the strings. To get that key, she had to follow his instructions.\nOne of his conditions was that she help him recruit Greenwald\nand other outlets for his disclosures. “The material provided and\nthe investigative effort required will be too much for any one person,”\nhe wrote to Poitras. He next directed her to contact Greenwald.\n“I recommend that at the very minimum you involve Greenwald. I\nbelieve you know him.” (Snowden apparently did not tell her that\nhe had unsuccessfully attempted to reach out to Greenwald before he\nhad contacted her.)\nHis continued interest in Greenwald was understandable. Aside\nfrom Greenwald’s opposition to what he called the “Surveillance\nState,” he was a gateway to The Guardian. That publication had\nbecome an important player in the business of disclosing government\ndocuments by publishing a large part of the U.S. documents\nsupplied to WikiLeaks, as we have seen. By breaking whistleblowing\nstories about U.S. intelligence, it had also greatly increased\nthe circulation of its website. As an establishment newspaper, it also\ngave these WikiLeaks stories credibility with the media. So despite\nGreenwald’s inability to create an encrypted channel, Snowden still\nneeded him. He had no reason to believe that Greenwald would turn\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 69\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n70 | how america lost its secrets\ndown the opportunity for a whistle- blowing scoop for The Guardian.\nAfter all, the classified documents Snowden would provide him\nwould also give credence to both Greenwald’s book and his many\nblogs denouncing U.S. government surveillance.\nAside from Greenwald and Poitras, Snowden sought an outlet\ninside the American establishment. So he had Poitras write to Barton\nGellman, the Pulitzer Prize– winning reporter for The Washington\nPost. Poitras had met Gellman in 2010, when they were both fellows\nat NYU’s Center on Law and Security. Poitras had requested help\nin encrypting her computer from Karen Greenberg, the executive\ndirector of the center, who took her “by the hand” to meet Gellman,\nGreenberg’s resident expert on encryption software. Born in 1960,\nGellman graduated from Princeton in 1981 and became an awardwinning\ninvestigative reporter for the Miami Herald, the Post, and\nTime magazine. He was also the author of Angler: The Cheney Vice\nPresidency. If Gellman could be drawn into the enterprise, he could\nprovide Snowden with a gateway to the prestigious American paper\ncredited with bringing down President Richard Nixon in the Watergate\nscandal.\nPoitras, as the go- between for Snowden, immediately contacted\nGellman. After telling him she was involved in a story about NSA\nsurveillance, she suggested that they meet in New York City.\nFor their rendezvous, Poitras took a number of precautions to\nevade anyone attempting to follow her. She had Gellman first meet\nher in one coffee shop in lower Manhattan. When he arrived, she had\nhim follow her on foot to another coffee shop, following her antisurveillance\ntradecraft. Once assured no one was watching them, she\nordered coffee for herself and Gellman. Over coffee, she told Gellman\nabout Snowden, whom she described as her anonymous source.\nShe said that he was willing to supply Gellman with documents that\nwould expose domestic surveillance, if Gellman agreed to write a\nstory on it for the Post. Even though Gellman had left the staff of\nthe Post in 2010, he had previously written several stories on that\nsubject for the newspaper, and he was also highly regarded by the\neditors there. Gellman was interested in Poitras’s offer (although he\nwould consult a friend at the Justice Department about the legality\nof publishing NSA documents).\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 70\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nString Puller | 71\nSnowden had now laid the groundwork for at least two possible\noutlets. Poitras, however, was having some difficulty in bringing\nGreenwald in on the plan. Like Snowden, she did not trust writing\nto him in unencrypted e- mails, and because Greenwald lived in Brazil,\nshe still had not found an opportunity for a face- to- face meeting\nwith him.\nThat opportunity arose in mid- April 2013. Greenwald had flown\nto the United States to give the lead speech at an event in Yonkers,\nNew York, sponsored by the Council on American- Islamic Relations,\na pro- Muslim civil rights organization. He had delivered the\nkeynote speech at its previous meeting in San Jose, California, where\nhis impassioned depiction of the American “Surveillance State”\nreceived a rousing ovation from the attendees. He was invited to\nspeak at this award dinner for its East Coast chapter.\nPoitras flew from Berlin to New York to see him. On April 19,\n2013, she arranged to meet Greenwald at noon in the restaurant of\nthe Marriott hotel where Greenwald was staying. When Greenwald\narrived at the restaurant carrying a cell phone, she explained to him\nthat the NSA could surreptitiously turn his cell phone into a microphone\nand use it to eavesdrop on their conversation. She told him to\ngo back to his room and leave his phone there. When he returned,\nphoneless, she took further precautions by having them change\ntables several times. Greenwald accepted these tactics because, as he\nlater said, she was in charge of their “operational security.”\nWhen they finally settled at a table in the nearly empty restaurant,\nshe showed Greenwald e- mails she had received from Citizen\nFour. Greenwald, as he recounted, made “no connection” to the\n“long- forgotten emails” he had received from Snowden under the\nalias Cincinnatus. Reading the e- mails that Snowden had sent to\nPoitras, he was impressed with the “sincerity” of the anonymous\ncorrespondent.\nWhen Poitras showed Greenwald Citizen Four’s mission statement\nin which he said his motive was to end the U.S. “surveillance\nstate,” Greenwald was further impressed with the source. The surveillance\nstate Snowden described closely dovetailed with the surveillance\nstate that Greenwald had described himself in his speech\nat the Council on American- Islamic Relations dinner in 2012. Of\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 71\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n72 | how america lost its secrets\ncourse, the similarity of the phrasing might not have been entirely\ncoincidental. Greenwald’s 2012 speech had been put on YouTube and\nwidely circulated on the Internet just a few days before Snowden\nfirst wrote to him on December 1, 2012. Snowden identified himself\nas a privacy advocate, which was also how Greenwald often identified\nhimself in his speeches. He also echoed other concerns Greenwald\nhad publicly expressed, including defending American privacy\nfrom government intrusions.\nSnowden promised the leaks he would supply would provide dramatic\nresults. He asserted in one of his e- mails to Poitras that the\n“shock” of the documents he would give Greenwald would result in\nthe public’s learning about the secret “mechanisms through which\nour privacy is violated.” According to Snowden’s assessment, following\nthat initial uproar, they could achieve another objective in their\ncommon cause. “We can guarantee for all people equal protection\nagainst unreasonable search,” he wrote. In light of this convergence\nof views, it is not surprising that Greenwald was fully convinced\nof Citizen Four’s bona fides. He said to Poitras, “He’s real,” and he\nagreed to help break the story in The Guardian.\nPoitras now revealed to Greenwald that Citizen Four would deliver\nan entire trove of secret documents to them in six to eight weeks.\nAccording to this timetable, the Greenwald scoop and the “shock”\nCitizen Four promised would come in early to mid- June 2013.\nAt this point in April, Snowden was in full control. Although\nhis job at Dell involved endlessly monitoring largely meaningless\nencrypted messages in the NSA tunnel, he had been able to get three\nmajor journalists to react favorably to his proposal. None of them\nknew his name, position, age, location, or where precisely he worked.\nNor did they know the means by which he planned to obtain the\nsecrets that he dangled before them. They also did not know where,\nor even if, they would meet their source. Their total knowledge about\nhim was the description he improperly gave of himself: a “senior\ngovernment employee in the intelligence community” (Greenwald\nspeculated that he was a disgruntled CIA station chief).\nEven though they were operating largely in the dark, these three\njournalists acted as almost any other ambitious reporter would if he\nor she were offered a major scoop about illegal acts of the govern-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 72\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nString Puller | 73\nment. In addition, the information was in line with what they had\npreviously investigated or written about. None of these journalists\nhad any reason to doubt at this point that their anonymous source\nwas anything but the sincere whistle- blower he claimed to be. They\ncould not have known from his anonymous e- mails that aside from\nthe whistle- blowing documents he promised them, he was in the\nprocess of stealing a large number of other documents that concerned\nthe NSA’s sources and methods in foreign countries. These\ndocuments, to which Snowden never referred in his correspondence\nwith them, had little if anything at all to do with domestic spying on\nAmerican citizens.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 73\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nchapter 8\nRaider of the Inner Sanctum\nThey think there’s a smoking gun in there that would be the\ndeath of them all politically.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2014\nThe nightmare of the NSA is a penetration. As the CIA, the\nFBI, and the NSA found out in the 1990s, no intelligence service\nis invulnerable to it. Any employee of a large intelligence organization\ncan turn, or be turned, against it. Among the more than ten\nthousand intelligence workers employed by the NSA, it is a near\ncertainty that over time more than one of them will become dissatisfied\nwith their work. A worker may have a personal grievance\nabout salary, lack of promotion, or treatment by his or her superiors.\nDisenchantment with the NSA may also proceed from idealistic\nobjections. The NSA is in the business of secretly intercepting\nmessages, and an insider could come to find its spying activities at\nodds with his or her own beliefs about the violation of privacy. For\nany of these reasons, a disgruntled insider could go rogue. He or she\nthen might attempt to right a perceived wrong by disclosing NSA\nsecrets to another party. That party might then induce or blackmail\nthe rogue employee into disclosing further secrets.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 74\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nRaider of the Inner Sanctum | 75\nTo guard against this, the NSA has developed a well- organized\nsystem for stratifying its data so that obtaining critical secrets\nrequired a rogue employee to burrow into its heavily protected inner\nsanctum. As part of this system, the NSA divides its data into different\ntiers depending on the importance of the secrets to its operations.\nThe first tier, Level 1, is mainly administrative material. This data\nwould include FISA court orders and other directives its employees\nmight need to check on to carry out their tasks. Level 2 contains\ndata from which the secret sources have been removed. This tier,\navailable to other intelligence services and policy makers, includes\nreports and analysis that can be shared. Level 3 contains documents\nthat cannot be shared outside a small group of authorized individuals,\nbecause they disclose the secret sources through which the NSA\nsurreptitiously obtained the information. This third tier includes,\nfor example, compiled lists of sources in China, Russia, Iran, and\nother adversary countries. It also discloses the exotic methods the\nNSA uses to get some of this data. Level 3 documents also include\nreports on specific NSA, CIA, and Pentagon operations unknown to\nadversaries. These Level 3 documents are described by NSA executives\nas “the Keys to the Kingdom,” because they could invalidate\nAmerica’s entire intelligence enterprise if they fell into the hands of\nan adversary. And, as far as is known, prior to 2013, there had been\nno successful theft of any Level 3 documents.\nBecause of their extreme sensitivity, Level 3 documents were not\nhandled by most of the private firms providing independent contractors.\nAt Dell, Snowden had access mainly to Level 1 and Level 2 data\n(which he could, and did, download from shared sites on NSANet).\nThese lower- level documents had whistle- blowing potential because\nthey concerned NSA operations in the United States. They did not\nreveal, however, sources that the NSA used in intercepting the military\nand civilian activities of foreign adversaries.\nSnowden quit his job at Dell as a system administrator on\nMarch 15, 2013, to take another job working for the NSA in Hawaii\nat Booz Allen Hamilton. Unlike other outside contractors that serviced\nthe NSA, the firm he now chose specialized in handling the\nNSA’s Level 3 data.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 75\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n76 | how america lost its secrets\nWhen Snowden applied to Booz Allen earlier in March 2013, the\ncompany had no opening for a system administrator at the National\nThreat Operations Center, an NSA unit in which it dealt with\nLevel 3 data. It did have an opening for an infrastructure analyst, a\nlower- paying job involving maintaining the computer technology\nnecessary to monitor threats. Despite a cut in pay, Snowden took\nthat job. “Snowden was an IT guy, not a SIGINT analyst,” a former\nNSA Signals Intelligence officer pointed out. “He was working as a\ncontracted infrastructure analyst for NSA’s Information Assurance\narm, . . . [which, ironically as it turned out] protects classified U.S.\ncommunications from potential intruders.” Steven Bay, the manager\nat Booz Allen who hired and supervised Snowden, recalled that the\nfirst “red flag” came up soon after Snowden began he training, when\n“Snowden began asking about a highly classified mass-surveillance\nprogram” to which Snowden did not have access (although Bay did).\nIn retrospect, Bay realized that Snowden had applied for the job for a\nspecific reason. “He targeted our [Booz Allen] contract directly,” Bay\nsaid. “Somehow he figured out that our contract, and what we did\non that contract, were the types of gates he needed to get access to.”\nSnowden subsequently told the South China Morning Post that\nhe took this job to “get access to lists of machines all over the world\nthe NSA had hacked.” If so, he was after the keys to the NSA’s kingdom\nof global surveillance. Booz Allen held those keys. “He targeted\nmy company because we enjoy more access than other companies,”\nBooz Allen’s vice- chairman Michael McConnell said with the benefit\nof hindsight. As a result of the theft, he appraised, “an entire generation\nof intelligence was lost.” McConnell, a former NSA director,\nwas in a position to know.\nSnowden’s sudden career change had both advantages and disadvantages\nfor the enterprise he was planning. The main advantage\nwas that he would have proximity to the computers in which were\nkept the “lists” he sought of NSA global sources. The main disadvantage,\naside from a cut in salary, was that he would no longer be a\nsystem administrator. This change meant he would no longer have\nprivileges to bypass password restrictions or temporarily transfer\ndata. Instead, as an infrastructure analyst, he would not have pass-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 76\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nRaider of the Inner Sanctum | 77\nword access, at least during the two- month- long training period, to\nthe computers that he had not been specifically “read into,” which\ndid not include those computers that stored the Level 3 lists. Access\nto these tightly controlled compartments was limited to only a handful\nof analysts at the center who had a need to know.\nBecause the new job entailed handling higher- level secret documents,\nBooz Allen had stricter requirements for applicants than\nDell. To slip by them, Snowden had engaged in a minor subterfuge.\nHe wrote on his application that he was expecting a master’s degree\nfrom the online division of Liverpool University in England. In fact,\nhe had not completed a single course at Liverpool and would not be\nreceiving any sort of a degree from it. Booz Allen did not verify this\nand had agreed to hire him as a trainee- analyst. It did not change\nthat decision even after it found out about his subterfuge.\nAccording to Admiral McConnell, Snowden never actually\nworked in the Booz Allen offices, which are housed in a skyscraper in\ndowntown Honolulu. Instead, he was immediately assigned to work\nat the NSA’s highly sensitive National Threat Operations Center at\nthe Kunia base, the same location where he had worked for Dell.\nBefore he could begin working there, however, he needed to fly to\nMaryland to take a mandatory orientation course at the NSA. The\ncourse was given in an eleven- story building, with a sheer wall of\nblack glass, on the NSA’s 350- acre campus at Fort Meade. He arrived\nthere from Hawaii on April 1, 2013. Like every other Booz Allen\ncontractor who worked at the NSA’s center, Snowden was required\nto sign the “Sensitive Compartmented Information Nondisclosure\nAgreement.” In this document, Snowden acknowledged that he had\nbeen granted access to sensitive compartmented information, called\nSCI, as part of his work and that he understood that any disclosure\nof that information to an unauthorized person would violate federal\ncriminal law. He was also told, as were all new contract employees\nat Booz Allen, that its disclosure could damage the interests of\nthe United States and benefit its enemies. In signing the document,\nhe swore an oath not to divulge any of this information without\nfirst receiving written approval from U.S. authorities. So less than\ntwo months before he downloaded sensitive compartmented infor-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 77\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n78 | how america lost its secrets\nmation, he was fully aware of what the consequences of divulging\nthis information would be. By this time, as we know, he had already\nagreed to deliver classified data to three journalists.\nSnowden believed that bringing complaints to NSA lawyers or\nsupervisors was, as he put it, “playing with fire.” “When I was at\nNSA,” Snowden later said in Moscow, “everybody knew that for\nanything more serious than workplace harassment, going through\nthe official process was a career-ender at best.”\nNevertheless, on April 5, 2013, while still in the training facility\nin Maryland, he apparently sought to establish a paper trail for himself.\nHe wrote a letter to NSA’s Office of the General Counsel asking\nwhether or not NSA directives take precedence over acts of Congress.\nA lawyer from the Office of the General Counsel responded\nthree days later, addressing Snowden as “Dear Ed.” The lawyer said\nthat acts of Congress take precedence over NSA directives. He also\nsuggested that “Ed” phone him if he needed any further clarification.\nPresumably, Snowden had asked the question to elicit a reply\nhe could later use to bolster his claim that the NSA had ignored or\nrejected policies regarding NSA directives. Instead, the “Dear Ed”\nresponse was of little use to Snowden, because it did not dispute his\npoint that NSA directives must lawfully conform to the acts of Congress.\nThe NSA lawyer never heard back from “Ed.”\nSnowden completed his orientation course at Fort Meade on Friday,\nApril 12, 2013. While he was in Maryland, he took time off to\npay visits to both of his divorced parents. It would be the last time he\nwould see either of them in the United States.\nHe returned on April 13 to Hawaii. One domestic task he had to\nattend to was helping Mills pack up their possessions, which they\nstored in boxes in the garage. The lease on their house was up on\nApril 30, 2013, and they had to move. According to Mills, they found\na temporary rental just a few blocks away.\nOn Monday, April 15, Snowden began on- the- job training as\nan analyst at the National Threat Operations Center. He would\nnot complete the course. The same week he began the training, he\nprepared his exit by writing to Booz Allen and saying he needed a\nbrief medical leave in May to undergo treatment for epilepsy symptoms.\nAs far as is known, he did not suffer from epilepsy. Booz Allen\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 78\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nRaider of the Inner Sanctum | 79\nrequired a minimum of one month’s notice for foreign travel. By\nmaking the request, he lessened the likelihood that it would arouse\nundue suspicion when he departed for Hong Kong with stolen documents\non May 18. This brief window left him some four weeks to\ntake the lists that he coveted.\nSnowden carried out the heist with precision reminiscent of a\nMission: Impossible movie caper. First, he needed to get passwords to\nup to twenty- four compartments at the National Threat Operations\nCenter that he had not been read into. Even in the “open culture”\nof the NSA, this was not an easy challenge. He would be asking\none or more intelligence professionals to break strict NSA rules\nthat not only prohibited them from disclosing their passwords to an\nunauthorized party such as himself but required them to report any\nunauthorized person who asked to use their passwords. Remarkably,\nhe accomplished this incredible feat. He gained access to twenty- four\ncompartments containing the NSA’s most closely guarded secrets in\na matter of a few weeks.\nNext, he had to find the lists he was seeking in a vast ocean of\ndata. For this task, he used software applications called spiders to\ncrawl through the data and find the files he was after. He deployed\nthese robotic spiders, which presumably had been programmed in\nadvance, soon after he began working at the center. According to the\nsubsequent NSA damage assessment, Snowden’s spiders indexed\nwell over one million documents. Many of those that he copied and\nmoved were from Level 3 sensitive compartmented information,\naccording to the NSA analysis. The spiders also made his penetration\nrelatively safe. As previously mentioned, the Hawaii base did\nnot have a real- time auditing system. So alarm bells did not go off in\nthe security office when he indexed documents.\nFinally, Snowden had to find a way to transfer this data to a computer\nwith an opened USB port. This task was complicated by a security\nprecaution. Most of the computers at the center had had their\nports sealed shut to prevent unauthorized downloads. Making the\ntransfer even more difficult, he was working as an analyst in training\nin an open- plan office with closed- circuit security cameras. But it\nwas not impossible. System administrators sometimes used service\ncomputers that had unsealed ports to back up data before they did\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 79\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n80 | how america lost its secrets\nmaintenance work. Even though Snowden was no longer a system\nadministrator, he could still perhaps befriend a system administrator\nor even steal or borrow a service computer.\nWhatever the NSA’s and Booz Allen’s security measures, Snowden\nsucceeded in getting the files. In a matter of a few weeks, he managed\nto download hundreds of thousands of Level 3 documents to an\nunsealed computer. He also took some less sensitive documents from\nthe administrative file (which contained mainly Level 1 documents)\nat the end of April. These later acquisitions included an order from\nthe FISA court issued on April 25, 2013.\nHe had completed the operation by May 17, the last day he would\never enter the NSA facility. He transferred the data he had amassed\non the service computer, including the lists of the computers in Russia\nand China that the NSA had succeeded in penetrating, onto storage\ndevices, which he later said were thumb drives. Then he coolly\nwalked past the security guards at the exit, who only seldom performed\nrandom checks on NSA employees.\nHe carried out the entire operation with such brilliant stealth that\nhe left few if any clues behind as to how he obtained his colleagues’\npasswords to multiple compartments, moved the data from many\ndifferent supposedly sealed computers to an opened service machine,\nor downloaded these documents to multiple thumb drives without\narousing suspicion. The NSA would not discover the theft for fifteen\ndays.\nHis departure from Hawaii was also well prepared. Lindsay Mills\nhad departed that morning for a planned two- week visit to the outer\nislands. This trip allowed him to pack his belongings without saying\nanything to her that might be difficult for her to later explain. He\nsimply left a note that she could show to authorities saying that he\nwas away on a “business trip.” He informed Bay that he would have\nto go in for epilepsy tests on the following Monday and Tuesday. If\nthe results weren’t good, he might have to be out even longer.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 80\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nchapter 9\nEscape Artist\nI’m not self- destructive. I don’t want to self- immolate and erase\nmyself from the pages of history. But if we don’t take chances, we\ncan’t win.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2014\nThe next evening, May 18, Snowden drove to Honolulu International\nAirport. He left his leased car in the parking lot. He\ntook with him only carry- on baggage, including a backpack and a\nlaptop with a Tor sticker on it. “I took everything I had on my back,”\nhe said, referring to the backpack. He also said that he took enough\ncash to pay for his fugitive life and he took the thumb drives containing\nthe NSA’s keys to the kingdom.\nAt this point, of course, Snowden was not wanted by the authorities.\nHe had provided his employer and the NSA with a medical\nexcuse for his absence from work so he would not be immediately\nmissed. He had a valid passport, a credit card, and ID. Snowden’s destination\nwas Hong Kong. After crossing the international date line,\nSnowden waited about three hours in the transit zone of Narita. He\nthen boarded a plane to Hong Kong. After the four- hour flight from\nNarita, he arrived in Hong Kong early in the morning on May 20.\nHe had visited Hong Kong at least once before, with Lindsay\nMills, when he was stationed in Japan. According to Albert Ho, his\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 81\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n82 | how america lost its secrets\nHong Kong lawyer, Snowden stayed at a residence arranged for him\nin advance by a party whom Snowden knew prior to his arrival. As\nnoted earlier, for the next ten days, Snowden did not use his credit\ncard or leave any paper trail to his location. Wherever he was, “his\nfirst priority,” as he later told Greenwald, was to find a place safe\nfrom U.S. countermeasures. He brought with him a large number\nof electronic copies of NSA documents marked TS/SCI/NOFORN,\nwhich stood for “Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information,\nand No Foreign Distribution.” According to government rules,\ndata carrying these labels could not be removed from a governmentapproved\n“SCI facility.” But Snowden, who brought them with him\ninto this semiautonomous zone in China, broke these rules.\nWherever Snowden was staying, apparently he believed he was\nrelatively safe. “That whole period was very carefully planned and\norchestrated,” Snowden later told The Guardian in Moscow. On\nMay 22, he sent an e-mail to Bay (who did not know he had left\nHawaii) saying that his epilepsy tests came back with “bad” results,\nand he needed further medical attention. Here Snowden communicated\ndirectly first with Gellman and then with Greenwald. He\ne- mailed Gellman under the alias “Verax.”\nAlready, via Poitras, he had provided Gellman with PowerPoint\nslides from an NSA presentation about a joint FBI- NSA- CIA\noperation code- named PRISM. He believed it qualified as whistleblowing\nbecause it revealed that the NSA, in intercepting e- mails,\ntweets, postings, and other web interactions about foreign terrorists,\nincidentally also picked up data about Americans. According to the\nrules imposed on the NSA by a 2007 presidential directive, whatever\ninformation was accidently picked up about Americans was supposed\nto be filtered out, and hundreds of compliance officers were to\nrecheck the data every ninety days to assure that directive was being\ncarried out. Even so, it was likely some data was not expunged in this\nprocess. So PRISM could cause embarrassment for the NSA.\nSnowden had not yet made arrangements to meet journalists, but\nnow he proposed that Gellman join him in Hong Kong. In attempting\nto convince him of the urgency of the trip, he wrote that he had reason\nto believe that “omniscient State powers” imperiled “our freedom\nand way of life.” He noted, with a touch of modesty, “Perhaps\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 82\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nEscape Artist | 83\nI am naive.” He also added dramatically, “I have risked my life and\nfamily.” Even so, Gellman declined coming to Hong Kong. (According\nto Greenwald, Gellman could not make the trip, because lawyers\nfor The Washington Post were uneasy with having a reporter receive\nclassified documents in a part of China.)\nOn May 24, 2013, Snowden attempted to apply more pressure on\nGellman by telling him that the story about the PRISM program\nhad to be published by the Post within seventy- two hours. Gellman\ncould not accede to such a condition, because the decision of when to\npublish a story was made not by him but by the editors of the newspaper.\nHe told Snowden that the earliest the story could be published\nwas June 6, 2013, which was well past Snowden’s deadline.\nSnowden next turned to Greenwald in Brazil. Both Poitras and\nMicah Lee had made great efforts to tutor Greenwald on encryption\nprotocols, with Lee’s sending Greenwald a DVD by FedEx that would\nallow him to receive both encrypted messages and encrypted phone\ncalls. Even then, Greenwald was unable to fully install it. As a result,\nGreenwald still had not met Snowden’s requisites on encrypting his\ncomputer.\nWith Gellman uncertain, Greenwald was now essential to Snowden’s\nplan. If he was to have any newspaper outlet, he needed to\npersuade Greenwald to come to Hong Kong. At this point, he took\nmatters into his own hands. On May 25, Snowden somewhat aggressively\ne- mailed Greenwald, saying, “I’ve been working on a major\nproject with a mutual friend of ours. You recently had to decline\nshort- term travel to meet with me.” Although he did not specify the\n“short- term travel” to which he referred, he added pointedly, “You\nneed to be involved in this story.” He suggested that they immediately\nspeak on the phone via a website that encrypts conversations.\nSnowden began the call by complaining, “I don’t like how this\nis developing.” He made it clear that he, not the journalist he had\nselected, was pulling the strings. If Greenwald wanted the scoop, he\nhad to follow Snowden’s instructions, which included dividing the\nscoops between The Guardian and The Washington Post. According\nto his plan, Gellman would break the PRISM story in the Post, and\nGreenwald would break the “mass domestic spying” story in The\nGuardian. In addition, he insisted that The Guardian publish his per-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 83\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n84 | how america lost its secrets\nsonal manifesto alongside its story. As he envisioned it, the media\nevent would also include a video component in which Greenwald\nwould interview him.\nGreenwald agreed to this micromanaging, So Snowden said he\nwould send him what he called a “welcome package” of documents\nto demonstrate his good faith. His plan also required a face- to- face\nmeeting. Snowden told him, “The first order of business is to get you\nto Hong Kong.” The whole conversation lasted two hours, according\nto Greenwald.\nSnowden sent him twenty classified NSA documents labeled “Top\nSecret.” He also included in the package his personal manifesto,\nwhich asserted that the NSA was part of an international conspiracy\nof intelligence agencies that were working to “inflict upon the world\na system of secret, pervasive surveillance from which there is no\nrefuge.”\nMeanwhile, Snowden told Poitras he was sending her a number of\nNSA documents, including a FISA warrant that had been issued less\nthan a month earlier. He wanted that FISA warrant to serve as the\nbasis of Greenwald’s scoop. It was perfect whistle- blowing material\nfor The Guardian because it ordered Verizon to turn over all its billing\nrecords for ninety days to the NSA. It was as close to a smoking\ngun as anything he had copied at the NSA. It would also get attention\nbecause James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, had\nstated before Congress just two months earlier that the NSA did not\ncollect phone data in America. This warrant would allow The Guardian,\nin the best tradition of gotcha journalism, to catch Clapper in an\napparent lie.\nContinuing his string pulling, Snowden instructed Poitras not to\nshow the FISA warrant to Greenwald until they were safely aboard\na plane to Hong Kong. That would prevent Greenwald from releasing\nthe story previously. He also sent Poitras an entire encrypted\nfile of NSA documents, saying it would “include my true name and\ndetails for the record, though it will be your decision as to whether\nor how to declare my involvement.” He did not send her the key to\ndecipher the file, saying, “The key will follow when everything else\nis done.” He further told her that he preferred that her new film\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 84\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nEscape Artist | 85\nfocus on him as the sole perpetrator of the leak so that no one else at\nthe NSA would be suspected.\nPoitras and Gellman were not the only journalists involved in\nthe news event. Poitras also asked Appelbaum to help her interview\nSnowden about the NSA’s operations. She later said that she needed\nsomeone with technical expertise in government surveillance to test\nthe bona fides of Citizen Four. She believed that Appelbaum, who\nhad participated in her anti- NSA presentations in 2012, qualified for\nthe position.\nSnowden previously had contact with Appelbaum. Appelbaum\nhad communicated with Snowden under his Oahu CryptoParty alias\nabout an obscure piece of software just a few weeks after Snowden\nhad met with Runa Sandvik in Hawaii in December 2012. Appelbaum,\nin fact, had worked with Sandvik as a core developer of Tor\nsoftware. Snowden allowed Appelbaum to put detailed questions to\nhim concerning the secret operations of the NSA before he met with\nPoitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong. Indeed, Poitras joined him\nin asking Snowden via encrypted e- mails such questions as “What\nare some of the big surveillance programs that are active today\nand how do international partners aid the NSA?” “Does the NSA\npartner with other nations, like Israel?” and “Do private companies\nhelp the NSA?” Snowden answered all the questions to the satisfaction\nof Appelbaum and Poitras. (The interview was published on\nJuly 8, 2013, with Snowden’s approval on the website of Der Spiegel,\nthe German weekly, which had also published the WikiLeaks\ndocuments.)\nAs the days ticked away while Snowden was waiting for Greenwald\nin Hong Kong, Greenwald was awaiting a green light to go\nthere from Janine Gibson, the editor of the Guardian website, who\nwas based in New York. Under Gibson’s leadership, The Guardian’s\nwebsite had effectively “gone into the business of publishing government\nsecrets,” as the Guardian columnist Michael Wolff pointed\nout. Most of the documents had been supplied by Bradley Manning\nvia WikiLeaks. Few if any of these previous documents The\nGuardian published were highly classified, and none were SCI top\nsecret documents. The NSA documents Greenwald had received\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 85\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n86 | how america lost its secrets\nfrom Citizen Four were another matter. They contained the sort of\nSCI communications intelligence data that no major newspaper had\never published before. Their disclosure might result in journalists’\nbeing imprisoned, because both British law and U.S. law criminalized\nthe disclosure by anyone of communications intelligence. As a\nlawyer, Greenwald recognized this danger. On the other hand, the\nNSA documents were far more explosive than the WikiLeaks material\nand promised an even greater spike in circulation. So Greenwald\nassumed that Gibson would be willing to authorize their publication\nand provide the expenses for his trip to Hong Kong.\nHe flew from Rio to New York on May 30 to meet in person\nwith Gibson, who had concerns about publishing what were purported\nto be top secret documents that came from an anonymous\nsource. She was certainly not willing to go along with Citizen Four’s\ndemand that The Guardian publish his personal manifesto alongside\nthe documents. Aside from its shrill and alarming tone, it sounded,\nas she told Greenwald, “a bit Ted Kaczynski- ish,” referring to the\nmathematician known as the Unabomber who had maimed or killed\ntwenty- six people with anonymous mail bombs between 1978 and\n1995. Kaczynski had also demanded that newspapers publish his\npersonal manifesto. Gibson explained to Greenwald, “It is going to\nsound crazy to some people.” Her concern was that it would detract\nfrom the credibility of the rest of the story. Snowden had also written\nto Greenwald to explain his position. “Even the Constitution is\nsubverted when the appetites of power demand it,” Snowden said.\nParaphrasing President Thomas Jefferson, he continued, “Let us\nspeak no more of faith in man, but bind him down from mischief by\nthe chains of cryptography.” Snowden, showing his cultlike faith in\nencryption, substituted “cryptography” for Jefferson’s word “constitution.”\nGibson was unmoved. The stolen NSA documents were\nanother matter. They were an enormous scoop that could have a\ngreater impact than the WikiLeaks scoop.\nGibson authorized Greenwald’s trip to Hong Kong on the condition\nthat he take with him a Guardian staffer in whom she had\nconfidence, the Scottish- born Ewen MacAskill, a sixty- one- year- old\nveteran journalist who had been the Washington bureau chief for\nThe Guardian. His assignment was to evaluate the bona fides of the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 86\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nEscape Artist | 87\nanonymous source in Hong Kong for Gibson. Greenwald accepted\nher terms. Poitras, who would be accompanying them, would be\npaying her own way.\nIn case The Guardian failed to publish the story, Snowden had a\ncontingency plan in place. While Greenwald was negotiating with\nGibson, Snowden arranged for Micah Lee, Poitras’s associate at the\nFreedom of the Press Foundation, to build a personal website for\nhim. Writing to Lee from Hong Kong, first under his alias Anon108\nand later under his real name, Snowden said that he planned to post\nhis “anti- surveillance manifesto.” He would also use it to post “a\nglobal petition against surveillance.” Snowden had Lee name the site\n“SupportOnlineRights.com.” According to Lee, the website would\nbe built with a “dead man’s switch,” which would automatically\ntrigger the release of NSA documents if Snowden was arrested. It\nwas not clear whether Lee was doing this work as a freelancer or in\nhis capacity as the chief technology officer for the Freedom of the\nPress Foundation. The website Lee built for Snowden proved unnecessary\nwhen Poitras e- mailed him on June 1 that The Guardian had\napproved the trip and she and Greenwald were booked on a Cathay\nPacific flight to Hong Kong. They would arrive the next day.\nIn his preparation to go public in Hong Kong, Snowden showed\nhimself fully capable of orchestrating what would become a major\nnews story. He not only picked the journalists who would break\nit but also instructed each of them as to the timing, sequence, and\ncontent of their initial disclosures. In the security of his unknown\nresidence in Hong Kong, he also worked to carefully separate the\npurloined NSA documents into two very different caches. “I carefully\nevaluated every single document I disclosed,” Snowden\nexplained to the Guardian journalists in early June. The documents\nin this first cache were selected to serve what he termed the “public\ninterest.” In the hands of journalists, these selected documents,\nand the story he fashioned to accompany them, would burnish his\nimage in the public consciousness as a whistle- blower. He did not\nturn over the second cache, telling Greenwald, “There are all sorts\nof documents that would have made a big impact that I didn’t turn\nover.”\nBy the time he received the message from Poitras, Snowden had\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 87\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n88 | how america lost its secrets\nfinished his preparations for the journalists. With selected documents\ncopied on a thumb drive, he moved from the residence where\nhe had been staying for ten days to a venue for meeting the reporters.\nThe place he chose, as noted earlier, was the Mira hotel in the\nKowloon district of Hong Kong, where he checked in under his own\nname. He e- mailed Poitras his name and the address of the hotel;\nthere was no longer any reason to hide his true identity.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 88\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nc h a p t e r 10\nWhistle- blower\nThey elected me. The overseers . . . The [American] system failed\ncomprehensively, and each level of oversight, each level of responsibility\nthat should have addressed this, abdicated their responsibility.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2013\nWhile snowden in Hong Kong was attempting to reel in\nthe journalists, Lindsay Mills returned to Honolulu from\nher “island- hopping” trip to find their house partially flooded and\nSnowden nowhere to be found. In a brief note Snowden left her, he\nsaid he was away on a business trip and indicated that, at least temporarily,\ntheir eight- year relationship was on hold.\n“I feel alone, lost, overwhelmed, and desperate for a reprieve from\nthe bipolar nature of my current situation,” she wrote in her journal\non June 2 (which would be June 3 across the international timeline\nin Hong Kong). “I’ve nearly lost my mind, family, and house over\nthe past few weeks.” She also noted in her online journal, “Oh and\nI physically lost my memory [SIM] card with nearly all my adventure\nphotos,” as well as other personal data. The loss would make it\ndifficult to reconstruct her past activities with Snowden.\nIn Hong Kong, if Snowden were following Lindsay’s online journal,\nhe would have read that his girlfriend had returned home, lost\nher data, and needed a “reprieve” from the situation in which he had\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 89\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n90 | how america lost its secrets\nput her. But because they were exchanging private text messages\nby then, he would not have needed to consult her public journal.\nSnowden was certainly aware that he would soon be the object of a\nmanhunt that could involve those with whom he was acquainted. He\ninstructed Poitras to mask their e- mail communications in cyberspace\n“so we don’t have a clue or record of your true name in your\nfile communication chain.” Such precautions were necessary, he\nexplained to her, because “every trick in the book is likely to be used\nin looking into this.” The journalists arrived the evening of June 2.\nThe Mira hotel can be entered by guests both through a groundfloor\nlobby with a restaurant and a smaller third- floor lobby that\nconnects to the Mira shopping mall. The instructions that Snowden\nsent Poitras on her arrival were an exercise in control: “On timing,\nregarding meeting up in Hong Kong, the first rendezvous attempt\nwill be at 10 a.m. local time. We will meet in the hallway outside\nof the restaurant in the Mira Hotel. I will be working on a Rubik’s\ncube so that you can identify me. Approach me and ask if I know the\nhours of the restaurant. I’ll respond by stating that I’m not sure and\nsuggest you try the lounge instead. I’ll offer to show you where it is,\nand at that point we’re good. You simply need to follow naturally.”\nAccording to Greenwald’s account, Snowden changed the plan to the\nupper lobby. “We were to go to the third floor,” Greenwald writes.\n“We were to wait on a couch near a ‘giant alligator,’ ” which Poitras\nsaid was a room decoration. (A hotel executive told me that the hotel\nknew of no plastic alligator on the third floor but possibly it had\nbeen temporarily parked there by a hotel guest.) They were then\nto give the recognition signal. Although these instructions provided\nthe atmospherics of “an international spy thriller,” as Greenwald\ndescribed them, Snowden hardly needed any spy tradecraft to recognize\nGreenwald and Poitras because there were many photographs\nof them on the Internet.\nIn any case, they gave the recognition signal, twice, in the designated\nplace, and a young man walked over to them holding\na Rubik’s Cube. Greenwald noted, “The first thing I saw was the\nunsolved Rubik’s Cube, twirling in the man’s left hand.” The man\nsaid, “Hello,” and introduced himself as “Ed Snowden.”\nGreenwald was particularly surprised by Snowden’s boyish looks.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 90\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nWhistle- blower | 91\n“The initial impression was one of extreme confusion,” Greenwald\nwrote in his book. “I was expecting to meet somebody in his sixties\nor seventies, someone very senior in the agency, because I knew\nalmost nothing about him prior to our arrival in Hong Kong.” His\ninitial confusion was understandable. Snowden, it will be recalled,\nhad falsely identified himself to them in an e- mail as a senior member\nof the intelligence community.\nSnowden led Greenwald and Poitras to the nearby elevator, and\nthey went through various corridors of the hotel to his room on\nthe tenth floor. It was mainly occupied by a king- sized bed, but it\nalso featured a sleek writing desk in the corner, two chairs, and a\nmodernistic lamp. The bathroom was behind a glass partition, which\ncould be closed off by a black louver blind. There was also a small\nrefrigerator in which Snowden asked them to stow their cell phones.\nSnowden, as we know, had already told Poitras that he wanted\nher to make a documentary of the meeting. She therefore wasted\nno time in mounting her camera on a tripod. “Minutes after meeting,\nI set up the camera,” she said. Snowden told her, “When you\nare involved in an action which is likely to get you indicted, you\ntypically don’t have a camera rolling in the room.” Nevertheless,\nhe allowed her to film his actions for the next eight days. One possible\nreason is that he had no intention of standing trial. In any case,\nas Poitras found out, Snowden was anything but camera shy. Over\nthe next week, she would shoot over twenty hours of Snowden’s\nactivities in that small room. It was essentially a one- man show, a\npresentation of him, by himself, for the appreciation of a global public.\nPoitras knew virtually nothing about her subject until ten minutes\nbefore she began filming him. She had not even googled him,\nbecause she was concerned that her Internet search might alert the\nNSA and law enforcement authorities. In an over- the- top waiver of\nhis own privacy, he allowed her to film him washing in the bathroom,\npreening his hair in the mirror, napping on his bed, getting\ndressed, and packing his bag. He even permitted her to film a private\ncomputer exchange between him and Mills (who was in Honolulu).\nThat day Mills informed Snowden that two government investigators\nhad come to their home in Hawaii, asking her about Snowden’s\nwhereabouts. When he had failed to show up for work on June 3 it\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 91\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n92 | how america lost its secrets\nevidently set off alarm bells at Booz Allen and the NSA. Snowden\nexpressed anger to the journalists in the room at the NSA’s intrusions\non the privacy of his girlfriend.\nSnowden also performed his security procedures on camera,\nincluding stuffing bed pillows under the door to block any eavesdroppers\nand throwing a red blanket over his head, which he called\njokingly his “magical cloak of power.” He explained to Greenwald\nthat he donned his “cloak” when he turned on his laptop to prevent\nany hidden cameras in the room from spotting his password. He also\nchecked the hotel phone for bugs. It was not without irony that he\nwent through these security rituals to protect his data as he allowed\nPoitras to film NSA data on his computer screen. Because he planned\nto use these journalists as his outlets to go public in a few days, the\nsecurity measures he performed while on camera would only serve\na temporary purpose.\nThe centerpiece of the planned video would take the form of an\ninterview with Greenwald. Snowden himself provided the talking\npoints. The filming would eventually provide Poitras with a featurelength\ndocumentary, Citizenfour, which would be commercially\nreleased in October 2014 and win an Academy Award for her.\nThe next day, Ewen MacAskill, whom Poitras had not wanted\nGreenwald to bring to the initial meeting, joined Poitras and Greenwald\nin Snowden’s room. Snowden insisted that MacAskill also go\nthrough the ritual of stowing his cell phone in the minibar refrigerator.\nNot without irony, Snowden’s own phone can be seen on his bed\nrecharging. Although MacAskill was sent by Gibson to the event to\nverify the source’s bona fides, he had apparently hardly been briefed.\nThe questioning went as follows:\nmacaskill: Sorry, I don’t know anything about you.\nsnowden: OK, I work for—\nmacaskill: Sorry, I don’t know even your name.\nsnowden: Oh, sorry, my name is Edward Snowden. I go by Ed.\nMacAskill went on to ask him to enumerate the various positions\nhe held during his career in intelligence. Snowden was not entirely\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 92\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nWhistle- blower | 93\ntruthful in describing himself. He said that he had been a senior\nadviser to the CIA, when he had been just a telecommunications support\nofficer. He also said he had been a senior adviser at the Defense\nIntelligence Agency, even though, according to that intelligence\nservice, he was never employed there. (He did speak at an interagency\ncounterintelligence course the DIA had sponsored.) He said\nhe had a $200,000- a- year salary from Booz Allen when, according\nto Booz Allen, it was $133,000. It is understandable that he wanted\nto impress these Guardian journalists in light of his young age and\nboyish appearance, even to the extent of meretriciously claiming\nin the video that he had been personally given the “authority” at\nthe NSA to intercept President Obama’s private communications,\nwhich, according to an NSA spokeswoman, was not true. No NSA\nemployee, and certainly no civilian contract worker, was given the\nauthority to spy on the president of the United States, she insisted.\nSuch career enhancements reinforced the fact that Snowden altered\nreality when it suited his purpose with journalists.\nSnowden had greatly exaggerated or misrepresented the positions\nhe held with the CIA and the DIA, but no effort was made by\nthe team of journalists to verify the information. Instead, MacAskill\nwrote to Janine Gibson in New York, “The Guinness is good.” It was\na prearranged code by which MacAskill certified Snowden’s credibility\nfor The Guardian. Gibson told Greenwald to proceed with the\nstory. Snowden had already provided Poitras and Greenwald with\nthumb drives on which he had loaded the documents he wanted\nthem to use.\nGreenwald wrote his first story about NSA transgressions based\nalmost entirely on the FISA warrant involving Verizon’s cooperation\nthat Snowden had copied from the administrative file. Before\nthe story could be published, however, the Guardian policy required\nrelevant American government officials be given the opportunity to\nrespond. Gibson made the requisite call to the White House national\nsecurity spokesperson, Caitlin Hayden, who arranged a conference\ncall with the FBI’s deputy director, Sean Joyce, the NSA’s deputy\ndirector, Chris Inglis, and Robert Litt, the legal officer for the Office of\nthe Director of National Intelligence. After duly taking into account\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 93\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n94 | how america lost its secrets\nthe response of these three officials, which included the admonition\nby Litt that “no serious news organization would publish this,” Gibson\ngave the green light to publish the story.\nThe story broke on June 6. “NSA Collecting Phone Records of\nMillions of Verizon Customers Daily,” proclaimed the Guardian\nheadline. Under Greenwald’s byline, it said, “Exclusive: Top secret\ncourt order requiring Verizon to hand over all call data shows scale\nof domestic surveillance under Obama.” Along with it was the FISA\norder. The PRISM story broke hours later in The Washington Post.\nWritten by Gellman and Poitras, it claimed that the NSA and the\nFBI were tapping directly into the central servers of nine leading\nU.S. Internet companies, which were knowingly participating in the\noperation. The latter allegation turned out to be not entirely true,\nbecause some of the Internet companies cited in the story denied\nthat they had knowingly participated. The back- to- back publication\nof these two stories by The Guardian and the Post, however, provided\nthe explosive “shock,” at least in the global media, that Snowden had\npredicted.\nSnowden’s identity had not been revealed in either the Guardian\nor the Post story on June 6. Snowden, however, insisted on outing\nhimself. He explained to Greenwald that he needed to “define himself”\nbefore the U.S. government “demonized” him as a spy. That\nself- definition would be accomplished by a twelve- minute video\ntitled “Whistleblower.” Poitras extracted much of the material for\nthe video from the twenty or so hours she had shot. In the filmed\ninterview, Snowden voiced many of the same statements he had\nmade in his manifesto, so he no longer needed to post that on the\nInternet. When he insisted on the immediate airing of the video,\nGreenwald told him that by going public in this way, he was saying\n“fuck you” to the American government. Snowden replied, “I want\nto identify myself as the person behind these disclosures.”\nOn June 9, the video was posted on the Guardian website with the\nFreedom of the Press Foundation getting an on- screen credit. “My\nname is Ed Snowden,” the extraordinary disclosure began. He then\ndescribed how the NSA was watching U.S. citizens. Even though the\nNSA press spokesperson subsequently disputed some of his more\ndramatic claims, such as his assertion that he had the authority at\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 94\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nWhistle- blower | 95\nthe NSA “to wiretap anyone, even the president,” the press largely\naccepted his claims as established facts. As for American surveillance,\nhe declared, “I don’t want to live in a society that does those sorts of\nthings.”\nThe Guardian story accompanying the video carried the headline\n“Edward Snowden: The Whistleblower Behind the NSA Surveillance\nRevelations.” Overnight, Snowden became a global celebrity\nand, to much of the world, a hero.\nThe next morning he packed his belongings into a backpack and\nmoved, without notifying the front desk, to another room Poitras\nhad rented at the Mira. Complicated schemes, especially when they\ninvolve transferring state secrets to unauthorized parties in a foreign\ncountry, do not necessarily go as planned. That was true of\nSnowden’s escape plan. Snowden had no plan to stay put and face\nthe music. On the morning of June 10, though, there was apparently\na problem. Robert Tibbo and Jonathan Man, the lawyers who, along\nwith Albert Ho, had been retained for Snowden by an unidentified\nparty, received an emergency phone call early in the morning telling\nthem to help Snowden move to a safe location. Although Tibbo\nwould not identify the person who had called, the message had been\nrelayed to Man and him through Ho’s office. When Tibbo called\nSnowden offering to help him move, Snowden told him, “I can make\nmyself unrecognizable.”\nTibbo and Man immediately proceeded to the mall adjacent to\nthe Mira hotel, where they met Snowden. After he signed a document\nappointing Ho’s law firm as his “legal adviser,” the three of\nthem slipped out via the mall exit. Tibbo and Man planned to move\nSnowden to the apartments of refugees who were their clients.\nSnowden’s credit card had been frozen, so it is not clear who\npaid his sizable hotel bill. According to hotel records, it was paid\nby another credit card. Poitras, who had taken a room at the hotel,\nmight have used her own credit card, or Snowden might have had\nanother benefactor in Hong Kong. In any case, the lawyers escorted\nSnowden to a prearranged residence.\n“I am in a safe house for now,” Snowden wrote to Greenwald on\nJune 11. The situation might not have been totally under his control,\nbecause he added, “But I have no idea how safe it is.”\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 95\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n96 | how america lost its secrets\nGreenwald flew back to Brazil that day. Soon afterward, he would\nresign from The Guardian. In February 2014, he became the cofounding\neditor of The Intercept, an online publication dedicated to\ninvestigative journalism, which was backed by the Internet billionaire\nPierre Omidyar.\nPoitras remained in Hong Kong, where she moved, along with the\nGuardian reporter MacAskill, to the five- star Sheraton Hong Kong\nHotel & Towers, which, like the Mira hotel, was on Nathan Road in\nKowloon. The Guardian paid the bill. Her next task was to set up\nwhat turned out to be Snowden’s final interview in Hong Kong. It\nwas scheduled for June 12.\nThe journalist chosen was Lana Lam, a young Australian reporter\nworking for the South China Morning Post. Tibbo had suggested\nLam to Snowden. She had served as Tibbo’s outlet on previous news\nstories, and, as he told me, he found her to be a totally reliable journalist.\nHe brought her to Poitras’s suite at the Sheraton in Kowloon.\nFirst, Lam had to agree to the conditions of the interview, which\nincluded submitting the story to Poitras for Snowden’s approval.\nNext, as Lam put it, Poitras “confiscated” her cell phone. Finally,\nafter a ten- minute wait, Poitras took her to another room and sat\nher before a black laptop. The laptop, which had a Tor sticker on it,\nhad on its screen an online chat room where she was connected by\nPoitras to Snowden.\n“Hi Lana, thanks for coming for this,” Snowden said from his safe\nhouse. He told her that the NSA had intercepted data from at least\nsixty- one thousand different computers in Hong Kong, China, and\nelsewhere. To expose what he called America’s “hypocrisy” in accusing\nChina of cyber espionage, he supplied her with relevant NSA\ndocuments. “Last week the American government happily operated\nin the shadows with no respect for the consent of the governed, but\nno longer,” he said. “The United States government has committed a\ntremendous number of crimes against Hong Kong [and] the People’s\nRepublic of China as well.” Under Poitras’s close supervision, Lam\nwas allowed to ask Snowden more questions about the NSA’s interception\nof communications in Hong Kong and China. He told her, “I\nhave had many opportunities to flee Hong Kong, but I would rather\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 96\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nWhistle- blower | 97\nstay and fight the United States government in the courts.” That bit\nof braggadocio would not be proven out.\nGreenwald, Poitras, and MacAskill in their reporting did not\nconcern themselves with any of the mechanics of the largest theft\nof top secret documents in the history of the United States. In the\nentire filmed interview at the Mira hotel, for example, they did not\nask their source how he managed to get access to the documents.\nLam, however, asked him about how he widened his access. When\nshe asked him why he had switched jobs from Dell to Booz Allen\nHamilton in March 2013, his answer provided her with a real scoop:\n“My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists\nof machines all over the world the NSA hacked.” Snowden told her\nthat he deliberately went to Booz Allen Hamilton to get access to\nthe “lists” revealing the NSA’s sources in foreign countries. This\nadmission could further complicate his legal situation in Hong Kong\nbecause it suggested that he meant to steal documents even before\nhe had known their content. In fact, to protect himself, he restricted\nLam from publishing this part of the interview until after he had\ndeparted Hong Kong. (It was not published until June 24, a day after\nhe arrived in Russia.) This condition indicated to Lam that as early\nas June 12, if not before, he was planning on leaving Hong Kong.\nHis interview with Lam didn’t reveal how he had learned about\nthese “lists” before taking the job. Nor did he reveal to her what he\nplanned to do with these lists. He made it clear to her, however, that\nhe had not disposed of all his secret documents. “If I have time to go\nthrough this information,” he said, “I would like to make it available\nto journalists in each country to make their own assessment,\nindependent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of US\nnetwork operations against their people should be published.” So as\nlate as June 12, Snowden was still reading and assessing the files he\nhad stolen from the NSA four weeks earlier.\nPoitras vetted the Lam interview. Soon afterward, she suspected\nthat she was being followed. That was likely, because by June 14 all\nthe intelligence services in Hong Kong knew that she was in contact\nwith Snowden.\n“I was being tailed,” Poitras recalled in an interview with a Vogue\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 97\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n98 | how america lost its secrets\nreporter in Berlin in 2014. “The risks became very great,” she said in\ndescribing her situation in Hong Kong. So, on June 15, she left Hong\nKong and flew back to Berlin, where she began editing her footage\nof the Snowden interview.\nMeanwhile, Snowden, organizing his own exit from Hong Kong,\nplaced a call to Julian Assange.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 98\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nc h a p t e r 11\nEnter Assange\nThanks to Russia (and thanks to WikiLeaks), Snowden remains\nfree.\n— julian assange, Newsweek, 2015\nJulian assange had made a brilliant career of trafficking in\nstate, military, and corporate secrets. Born on July 3, 1971, in\nQueensland, Australia, Assange began his hacking career while still\na teenager. Using the alias Mendax (“the untruthful one”), he had\nhacked into the computers of the Pentagon, the U.S. Navy, NASA,\nCitibank, Lockheed Martin, and Australia’s Overseas Telecommunications\nCommission before he was twenty. At the age of twenty- five,\nhe pleaded guilty to twenty- five charges of hacking in Australia but\nwas released on a good behavior bond. In 2006, with the spread of\nTor software, he co- founded WikiLeaks, a website in which secret\ndocuments could be anonymously sent and posted. The site received\nlittle public attention until Bradley Manning sent it several hundred\nthousand lowly classified U.S. military and State Department\ndocuments in April 2010. With these stolen documents, WikiLeaks\nbecame a media sensation, and Assange, the runner- up for Time’s\nMan of the Year for 2010, became a leading figure, along with Appelbaum,\nin the global hacktivist underground.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 99\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n100 | how america lost its secrets\nIn November 2010, however, he ran into a legal problem in\nSweden. A judge in Stockholm ordered his detention on suspicion\nof rape, sexual molestation, and unlawful coercion. He denied the\ncharges but was arrested in London on a European arrest warrant. In\nDecember, he was released on a $312,700 bail deposit (supplied by\nhis supporters) and confined to Ellingham Hall in Norfolk, England.\nWhile awaiting the outcome of the extradition proceedings, he lived\nthere with Sarah Harrison, his twenty- eight- year- old deputy at\nWikiLeaks. A graduate of the elite Sevenoaks School in Kent, Harrison\nserved as Assange’s liaison with the outside world. Although she\nwas officially given the title “investigative editor” of WikiLeaks, she\nworked so closely with Assange during this period that the British\npress carried stories saying she was his paramour. Harrison worked\non a WikiLeaks documentary titled Mediastan, which concerned\nWikiLeaks’s exposure of U.S. secret operations in Russia and other\nparts of the former Soviet Union. It was a project that took her to\nRussia and provided her with a multi- entry Russian visa.\nIn June 2012, after the extradition order was upheld, Assange\njumped bail and fled to the Ecuador embassy in London. For the next\nyear, his only visible means of income was a weekly program from\nthe embassy. It was sponsored in 2012 by RT television, a Moscowbased,\nEnglish- language news channel funded by the Russian government,\nwhich would also finance and release Mediastan. This\nsponsorship suggests that the Russian government saw potential\nvalue in the document- gathering activities of WikiLeaks.\nSnowden telephoned Assange at his refuge at the Ecuador\nembassy on June 10, 2013. According to Assange, Snowden needed\nhelp for his exit plan. He wanted Assange to use WikiLeaks’s\n“resources” to get him out of Hong Kong. Assange considered it a\nsurprising request, because Snowden had not given any of the stolen\ndocuments to WikiLeaks. In their discussion, according to Assange,\nSnowden claimed that one reason he decided to take the secret NSA\ndocuments was the brutal treatment of Bradley Manning after he\nwas arrested in 2010 by the U.S. government. “Snowden told me\nthey had abused Manning in a way that contributed to his decision\nto become a whistle- blower,” Assange said in an interview in 2015.\nIf Manning’s mistreatment was Snowden’s motive, it was a sharp\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 100\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nEnter Assange | 101\ndeparture from the position Snowden had taken in his postings on\nthe Ars Technica site in January 2009. He complained in a post there\nabout the detrimental consequences to U.S. intelligence of leakers’\nrevealing “classified shit” to The New York Times, and he suggested\nas punishment “those people should be shot in the balls.” Either he\nhad a change of heart, or he was telling Assange what he believed he\nwanted to hear.\nAssange counseled Snowden to go directly to Russia. “My advice\nwas that he should take asylum in Russia despite the negative PR\nconsequences,” he told the London Times in 2015. He said, “Snowden\nwas well aware of the spin that would be put on it if he took asylum\nin Russia.” So a story would be released presumably by WikiLeaks,\ncoinciding with his departure, asserting that Snowden was “bound\nfor the republic of Ecuador via a safe route.” When Snowden asked\nhow he would carry out the plan, Assange told him that he would\nimmediately dispatch one of his senior staff members to help him\nengineer his escape to Russia. That senior staff member was Sarah\nHarrison.\nAfter speaking to Snowden, Assange called Harrison, who was in\nMelbourne. She had gone there a month earlier to help organize\nAssange’s somewhat quixotic election campaign for president of\nAustralia. Assange told her to forget the campaign and go to Hong\nKong. She was to use WikiLeaks’s resources to save Snowden from “a\nlifetime in prison.” Presumably, Assange told her that he had advised\nSnowden to proceed to Russia. Harrison later said that she didn’t\neven bother to pack her clothing after hearing from Assange. She\ncaught the next plane to Hong Kong and arrived there on June 11—\nthe same day that Snowden texted Greenwald he was in a safe house\nand before Snowden’s explosive interview with Lam. Harrison had\nher own connections in Hong Kong. Her two younger sisters, Kate\nand Alexandra, lived there and were part of the expatriate community.\nShe also had an older brother, Simon, who headed Avra, a ship\nbrokerage and commodity trading company, headquartered in Singapore,\nbut he frequently traveled to Hong Kong on business.\nLike Poitras, Sarah Harrison took great care to shield her movements.\nShe did not have a Twitter, Facebook, or any other social media\naccount. She did not own a cell phone for fear of being tracked by an\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 101\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n102 | how america lost its secrets\nintelligence service. When she traveled, she bought “burner” phones\nlocally and disposed of them before any calls could be traced back to\nher. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, she avoided meeting Snowden\nface- to- face out of concern about the surveillance of American intelligence\nthere. Instead, for thirteen days in Hong Kong she worked\nthrough intermediaries. Her task was not only to arrange Snowden’s\nescape route but also to create diversions to camouflage his real destination.\nUnder Assange’s tutelage, she had made deceptive ploys an\nintegral part of her tradecraft. “We were working very hard to lay as\nmany false trails as possible,” she later told an interviewer in Berlin.\nAccording to Assange, she booked decoy flights for Snowden to\nBeijing and New Delhi. She also used Snowden’s credit card number\nto pay for the flight to India; because the card was blocked, she knew\nthere was a high probability that it would come to the attention of\nU.S. intelligence. According to Harrison, she booked no fewer than\na dozen such decoy tickets to confuse Snowden’s possible pursuers\nin U.S. intelligence. The only actual ticket she bought for Snowden,\naccording to an Aeroflot official, was one to Moscow at the last minute.\nShe bought a ticket for herself on the same flight, leaving on\nJune 23.\nThe source of the money for the Assange- Harrison operation is\nunclear. Subsequently, Harrison said she was setting up secret bank\naccounts to help organize such transborder escapes. Assange said she\nwas using “WikiLeaks’s resources.” Harrison said the “WikiLeaks\nteam” helped fund Snowden’s flight to Russia from Hong Kong, as\nwell as her own flight there. But WikiLeaks was not an organization\nwith spare cash in June 2013. Assange had forfeited his own bail by\nfleeing to the embassy of Ecuador, offending many of his financial\nsupporters in Britain. He had also all but exhausted his bank account.\nAside from money that dribbled in from Poitras’s six- month- old\nFreedom of the Press Foundation, the only steady source of funds\nfor WikiLeaks in 2013 was the previously mentioned payments\nAssange received from the Russian government’s RT television.\nMounting pressure was brought on the Hong Kong government\nto take action against Snowden. On June 16, the U.S. government\ninformed the Hong Kong authorities that it had filed a criminal\ncomplaint against Snowden and would be seeking his extradition.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 102\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nEnter Assange | 103\nBecause Hong Kong had a vigorously enforced extradition agreement\nwith the United States, as mentioned above, it was expected\nthat Snowden would be taken into custody. But China had the final\nsay in any extradition decision. In fact, China had explicitly been\ngiven the right of vetoing any extraditions for any reason in the\nformal 1999 agreement between Hong Kong and the United States.\nBecause the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had just met with President\nObama in California, China also had an interest in avoiding\nembarrassing public demonstrations on behalf of Snowden. According\nto a well- placed official in Hong Kong, China’s liaison office in\nHong Kong told the Hong Kong Authority in no uncertain terms\nthat Snowden had to be out of Hong Kong by June 23.\nOn June 19, Snowden had a meeting with Tibbo, the barrister who\nwould handle any eventual court case, and Man and Ho, the Hong\nKong solicitors who had been retained for him. It took place in a\nsmall apartment where, according to Ho, they ate pizza while they\ndiscussed Snowden’s options.\nTibbo wanted Snowden to remain in Hong Kong, allow himself\nto be arrested, seek bail, and fight extradition in court. Tibbo said\nhe planned to mount a powerful legal defense against extradition\nby using a provision in Hong Kong’s extradition treaty with the\nUnited States that protects fugitives from persecution on political\ngrounds. After he told Snowden that it would entail a long court\nbattle, Snowden asked him if he could avoid even being arrested.\nTibbo explained that Hong Kong courts, which closely follow\nBritish law, would certainly issue an arrest warrant for him immediately\nafter the United States formally filed charges against him.\nThose charges could come within hours, he reckoned. Soon afterward,\nSnowden would be temporarily jailed, and his computers,\nelectronic gear, and thumb drives would be seized and placed in the\ncustody of the court. Tibbo would immediately seek his release on\nbail but could not guarantee an outcome because Snowden, who\nhad fled U.S. jurisdiction, might be considered a flight risk. If so,\nSnowden could remain incarcerated during the long court battle.\nDuring the litigation, Snowden would have a platform to make\nhis case against U.S. surveillance. Indeed, Tibbo’s strategy involved\nbuilding massive public support for Snowden’s cause. Once the U.S.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 103\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n104 | how america lost its secrets\ngovernment filed charges, though, Snowden could further expect it\nwould invalidate his passport to go anywhere except for his return to\nthe United States, and Interpol would issue a red alert to all its members.\nBecause his case involved national security secrets, he had also\nto consider that the Hong Kong court could deny him any use of the\nInternet until his extradition case was settled. If Snowden wanted to\nleave Hong Kong, he had to act swiftly.\nTibbo, although evasive on the point when I interviewed him,\nmight not have known about the escape Harrison was planning. He\ndid not know that Snowden’s other alternatives were not good. He\nhad no money, and his credit card had been blocked. He had no visas\nto go to any other country, and Interpol would issue its own border\nalert as soon as the United States filed its charges. At that point,\nHong Kong airport authorities would be officially notified and could\nprevent him from leaving the city. Even if he somehow got out, he\nwould be an international fugitive. Tibbo counseled Snowden to seek\nredress in the Hong Kong courts.\nSnowden, though, had no intention of allowing himself to be\narrested. Despite what he had told Lana Lam only one week earlier,\nat least for publication, about his determination to seek justice in\nthe Hong Kong courts, he had not planned to use Hong Kong as\nanything more than a temporary stopover on his escape route. Two\nmonths later and safely in Moscow, he made this point clear in a\nlengthy interview with Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian.\nHe told him that it had never been part of his plan to use Hong\nKong to escape the legal consequences of his act. “The purpose of my\nmission [to Hong Kong] was to get the information to journalists.”\nIf so, he had merely been using Tibbo, Man, and Ho to provide him\nwith temporary cover while, following the instructions of Assange,\nHarrison laid down the smoke screen for his escape to Moscow.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 104\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nc h a p t e r 12\nFugitive\nIf I end up in chains in Guantánamo, I can live with that.\n— edward snowden, Hong Kong, 2013\nDuring his interviews with Poitras and Greenwald in June,\nSnowden said stoically, “If I am arrested, I am arrested.” His\nfatalistic words notwithstanding, Snowden had made plans to seek\na haven from American justice well before his meeting them. As\nearly as May 24, 2013, he had suggested to Barton Gellman that\nhe was making arrangements with a foreign government. To that\nend, he asked Gellman to insert an encrypted key in the Internet\nversion of the NSA exposé that Snowden proposed he write for The\nWashington Post. He told him the purpose of the encrypted key was\nto assist him with a foreign government. Snowden did not identify\nany foreign government to Gellman, but Gellman said he knew\nthat Snowden wanted to “seek asylum” overseas. He decided against\nassisting him. “I can’t help him evade U.S. jurisdiction— I don’t want\nto, and I can’t,” he later explained. “It’s not my job. It’s not the relationship.\nI am a journalist.”\nAlthough Gellman suspected that Iceland might be the foreign\ngovernment in question, Snowden, as it turned out, had never con-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 105\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n106 | how america lost its secrets\ntacted the consulate of Iceland while he was in Hong Kong. “We had\nheard nothing from Snowden,” an Iceland government official told\nVanity Fair.\nSnowden also did not contact the government of Ecuador while\nin Hong Kong. In mid- June, while Harrison was laying down false\ntracks for Snowden in Hong Kong, Assange in London asked Fidel\nNarváez, who was a friend of his and the legal attaché in the London\nembassy of Ecuador, to issue a document that Snowden could\nuse. But this document was not delivered to Snowden in Hong Kong\n(and it was later invalidated by Ecuador). There are no direct flights\nto Ecuador from Hong Kong. If Snowden had really planned to go to\nEcuador without stopping in a country allied with the United States,\nhe would have had to fly to Cuba. He would need a Cuban travel\ndocument to do that, which he could have obtained from the Cuban\nconsulate anytime during his month in Hong Kong. But he did not\nobtain it. Nor did he acquire a visa to go to any other country in\nLatin America or elsewhere while in Hong Kong. So where was he\nheaded?\nWhatever foreign government with which Snowden was dealing\nearlier presumably did not have an extradition treaty with the\nUnited States. Almost all other countries that did not have active\nextradition treaties with the United States could not be directly\nreached by air. With three notable exceptions, the flights to most of\nthese countries had stopovers in a country that was an ally of the\nUnited States, where officials could seize Snowden. The three exceptions\nwere China, North Korea (via China), and Russia.\nThe only one of these three countries that Snowden is known\nto have had contact with directly during his thirty- three- day stay\nin Hong Kong was Russia. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin,\nrevealed these contacts in a televised press briefing in September\n2013. Putin did not provide the date of these contacts, but he provided\nan intriguing clue. Snowden was identified to him, according\nto Putin, not by name but merely as an “agent of special services.”\nIf his name was not given to Putin, it might have been because\nSnowden’s first meeting with the Russians had taken place before\nSnowden became a household name on June 9, 2013.\nFor his part, Snowden was evasive when discussing his con-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 106\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nFugitive | 107\ntacts with Russia while still in Hong Kong. When Lana Lam asked\nSnowden on June 12, 2013, whether he had already requested asylum\nfrom the Russian government, he deferred, saying, “My only\ncomment is that I am glad there are governments that refuse to be\nintimidated by great power.” The Russian government was clearly\nnot intimidated by the threats of reprisals by the United States, as\nthe Obama administration would learn after Snowden’s arrival in\nRussia on June 23. Snowden could only have known that with certainty\non June 12 if he had been in contact with Russian officials\nprior to his interview with Lam.\nIf Putin’s own description of Snowden’s interactions with the\nRussians in Hong Kong is to be believed, the decision to facilitate\nSnowden’s escape to Russia had been kicked all the way up the Russian\nchain of command to Putin. Presumably, this decision- making\nprocess began earlier than June 21, when Snowden was said to have\ngone to the consulate. But how much earlier? Because Snowden had\narrived in Hong Kong on May 20, his contacts with Russian officials\ncould have occurred in May. Such a contact with the Russians\nwould fit with Snowden’s telling Gellman on May 24 that he needed\nhis help in dealing with the diplomatic mission of a country that\nSnowden did not identify.\nIn any case, Putin said an American “agent of the special services”\nhad contacted Russian diplomats because he wanted assistance. The\nagent, Snowden, of course, needed assistance to escape from Hong\nKong. The decision to accept him in Russia, given the international\nramifications, would have to be made at a much higher level than the\nRussian mission in Hong Kong.\nNine days before Snowden boarded Aeroflot Flight SU213 to\nMoscow on June 23, the United States had filed a criminal complaint\nagainst him. It had also officially alerted Interpol when it unsealed\nthe complaint on June 21. It had invalidated his U.S. passport except\nto return to America (although he still had it in his possession at\nthe Hong Kong airport). Because by this time he was the most\nfamous visitor in Hong Kong, his passage through passport control\non June 23 might have reflected the acquiescence of the Hong Kong\nauthorities to the reported request of China to be rid of Snowden by\nthat date.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 107\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n108 | how america lost its secrets\nAccording to one Aeroflot official, ordinarily all international passengers\nare required to have a valid passport as well as a visa to the\ncountry of final destination. Snowden had neither a valid passport\nnor a visa. Still Snowden was able to board the flight to Moscow.\nAeroflot, a state- controlled airline, presumably responds to the Russian\ngovernment on matters where Putin has given his approval.\nSnowden first met Harrison in person on June 23. She was waiting\nfor him in the car that Jonathan Man had arranged to take him\nto the airport that morning. Snowden was dressed in a gray shirt\nand khaki slacks. Harrison was dressed in jeans and flip- flops. She\nsaid she had chosen this dress style so that they would blend in at\nthe airport with vacationing tourists. She had financed the trip, and\nshe was apparently now calling the shots. Harrison’s concern was\nthat they might be arrested at the airport, so Man accompanied them\nthrough passport control. He was able to do this because he bought\na ticket on the cheapest available international flight. Harrison had\ngiven Man a phone number to call if they got arrested. When she\nand Snowden boarded the flight at 12:45 p.m., Harrison effectively\nbecame Snowden’s second “carer”— a job that would require her\npresence in Moscow for the next four months.\nSnowden had pretty much remained silent until the plane took\noff. The first full proper sentence she heard from him as they headed\nfor Moscow, as she recalled, was “I didn’t expect that WikiLeaks was\ngoing to send a ninja to get me out.”\nMeanwhile, Assange continued creating “distractions,” as he put\nit. On June 24, a booking was made for Snowden on an Aeroflot\nflight to Cuba, and this information was relayed to the foreign press\norganization in Moscow, resulting in over a dozen reporters flying\nto Havana on the flight. Snowden, of course, never showed up for it.\n“In some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that\n[flight] on open lines to lawyers in the United States,” Assange said.\nOne subsequent piece of his misinformation was that Snowden was\nflying to Bolivia on the private plane of the Bolivian president, Evo\nMorales (who was then in Moscow for a meeting). That misinformation\nhad the desired effect. U.S. allies in Europe, including France,\nSpain, and Portugal, refused to allow that plane to fly through its\nairspace, forcing the plane to land in Austria. This misinformation\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 108\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nFugitive | 109\nresulted in an international incident but did not change the fact that\nSnowden was still in the custody of Russian authorities.\nSnowden came to realize that those assisting him, including\nAssange and Harrison, were taking serious risks. “Anyone in a threemile\nradius [of me] is going to get hammered,” he later said in 2015\nto a reporter from Vogue. (After finally leaving Snowden in Moscow\non November 3, 2013, Harrison moved to Berlin, where she set up\nan organization to provide, as she termed it, “an underground railroad”\nfor other fugitives who had made available documents exposing\ngovernment secrets.)\nSnowden was sequestered in the transit zone of the Moscow airport\nfor thirty- seven days. A Russian intermediary provided him\nwith a Russian classic to read while awaiting asylum. It was Fyodor\nDostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, whose protagonist, Rodion\nRomanovich Raskolnikov, is a dissenter who believes breaking the\nlaw is morally justified by the unfair abuses of the political system.\nSnowden received official sanctuary in Russia on August 1, 2013.\nHis public statements in Hong Kong that he was willing to go to\nprison so that others could live freely in a democratic society were,\nas it turned out, mere rhetoric. Instead of risking prison, he had successfully\nescaped to a country in which he would be treated as a hero\nfor defying the U.S. government. He had not sacrificed himself; he\nhad transformed himself. He had risen from being a lowly technician\nin Hawaii whose talents went largely unrecognized to the status\nof an international media star in Moscow. In his new role, he could\nmake Internet appearances via Skype to prestigious gatherings, such\nas the TED conference, where he would be roundly applauded as an\nInternet hero, as well as be paid a $20,000 fee for just his electronic\nparticipation. He would be beamed into dozens of ACLU meetings\nwhere he was celebrated as a defender of American liberty. He would\ndescribe to sympathetic audiences in Germany, Norway, and France\nthe unfairness of the American legal system, asserting that it was\ndenying him a “fair trial.” He would now make front- page news\nby granting interviews to The New York Times, The Washington\nPost, The Nation, and other publications. He would join Poitras and\nGreenwald on the board of directors of the Freedom of the Press\nFoundation. He would be the subject of an Oscar- winning documen-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 109\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n110 | how america lost its secrets\ntary, the hero of the 2016 Hollywood movie Snowden (directed by\nOliver Stone), and a consultant to the 2015 season of the television\nseries Homeland. He would be nominated for the Nobel Peace\nPrize in 2014. He would attract over one million followers to his\ntweets in 2015. “For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission’s\nalready accomplished. I already won,” he informed the Post\nin his first live interview in Moscow in December 2013. It was a\nmission that involved a very high- stakes enterprise: taking not only\ndomestic surveillance documents but America’s military and foreign\nintelligence secrets abroad.\nWhistle- blowers do not ordinarily steal military secrets. Nor do\nthey flee to the territory of America’s principal adversaries. A fugitive,\nespecially one lacking a Russian visa, does not wind up in Moscow\nby pure accident. It’s hard to imagine that a Russian president\nwith the KGB background of Putin would give his personal sanction\nfor a high- profile exfiltration from Hong Kong without weighing\nthe gain that might proceed from it. Whatever else may be said of\nPutin, his actions show him to be a calculating opportunist. Part of\nhis calculus would be that the defector from American intelligence\nhad taken possession of a great number of potentially valuable documents\nfrom the inner sanctum of the NSA and, aside from these\ndocuments, claimed to hold secrets of great importance in his head.\nTo be sure, the practical value of this stolen archive would require\na lengthy evaluation by Russia’s other intelligence services. But it\nis hard to believe that a defector who put himself in the hands of\nthe FSB, the successor to the KGB, and other Russian intelligence\nservices wouldn’t be expected to cooperate with them. Even if such\na defector did not carry these files with him to Moscow, intelligence\nservices have the means to recover digital files, even after they are\nerased from a computer or if they are sent to the cloud. Moreover,\nonce secret documents are taken, they are compromised. Yet for\nmuch of the American public, Snowden remained a hero.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 110\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\npart two\nTHE INTELLIGENCE CRISIS\nWhat you’ve seen so far [in the Snowden theft of documents]\nis just the tip of the iceberg.\n—retired admiral michael mcconnell,\nvice- chairman, Booz Allen Hamilton, 2013\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 111\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 112\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nc h a p t e r 13\nThe Great Divide\nThat moral decision to tell the public about spying that affects all\nof us has been costly, but it was the right thing to do and I have\nno regrets.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2013\nIn the twelve- minute video on The Guardian’s website,\nSnowden correctly identified himself as an infrastructure analyst\nat a regional base of the National Security Agency in Oahu, Hawaii.\nHe also revealed in a calm, unemotional voice that he had been the\nsource for the stories in both The Guardian and The Washington\nPost. He said that he had supplied the secret, classified documents\nthat the two newspapers had used in their scoops about domestic\nsurveillance being conducted by the NSA, America’s enormous electronic\nsurveillance agency. These sensational revelations had been,\nliterally, the talk of the world, and now, in another major news event,\nthe boyish- looking Snowden took responsibility for what would\nturn out to be the largest theft of top secret documents in the history\nof U.S. intelligence.\nIn the video, it will be recalled, Glenn Greenwald, who had broken\nthe NSA story in The Guardian, questioned Snowden. What\nwas his motive? Greenwald asked. Why did he do it? Snowden\nreplied that he had become horrified by the NSA’s secret operations,\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 113\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n114 | how america lost its secrets\nwhich, to him, represented a kind of distillation of the excesses of\nthe American national security state, and he had therefore made it\nhis mission to blow the whistle. He believed that the public needed\nto be informed of the existence of a vast, secret surveillance operation\ndirected against tens of millions of Americans that flagrantly\nviolated U.S. laws and was a grave threat to their privacy and their\nfreedoms. Within hours of the release of that video on the Guardian\nwebsite, Snowden was known throughout the world as a courageous\nwhistle- blower.\nIn Laura Poitras’s remarks in accepting her Academy Award for\nCitizenfour on February 22, 2015, she said that Snowden acted as a\nwhistle- blower not only to “expose a threat to our privacy but to our\ndemocracy itself.” She received a standing ovation.\nA large part of the public who viewed this powerful film, including\nmany of my colleagues in journalism whose writing I greatly\nrespect, came to accept Snowden’s whistle- blowing narrative. The\nfilm so convincingly depicted Snowden as an altruistic young man\nwilling to risk his own personal freedom and face years of imprisonment\nfor the sake of others that editorial writers asked that he be\ngiven clemency from prosecution.\n“Sitting on his unmade bed— white sheets and covers, white headboard,\nwhite bathrobe, white skin— Snowden seems like a figure\nin some obscure ritual, being readied for sacrifice,” George Packer\nwrote about the film in a widely read article in The New Yorker.\nThis powerful narrative, as lucidly articulated by Poitras, Greenwald,\nand other Snowden supporters, described the NSA activities\nexposed by Snowden as part of a vast criminal conspiracy involving,\namong others, President Obama, James Clapper, the director of\nnational intelligence, and both Democratic and Republican members\nof the congressional oversight committees. It further derided any\nclaims that there was evidence that Snowden’s theft of NSA secrets\nwent beyond simply exposing government misdeeds. For example,\nthis narrative asserted, as if it were established fact, that U.S. government\nofficials had deliberately “trapped” Snowden in Russia.\nAccording to Snowden, the purpose of this government ploy was\nto “demonize” him. “There was no question that I was going to be\nsubject to a demonization campaign,” Snowden said in an interview\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 114\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Great Divide | 115\nfrom Moscow, “They [Greenwald and Poitras] actually recorded me\non camera saying this before I revealed my identity.” The purpose\nof this demonization was to divert attention from the government’s\nown crimes.\nTo be sure, it is not unprecedented for the government to release\ndefamatory information about individuals who have embarrassed\nU.S. intelligence by defecting. When two NSA analysts, William\nMartin and Bernon Mitchell, defected to Russia in the 1960s and\naccused the NSA of violating international law after arriving in\nMoscow, U.S. government officials responded by putting out the\nstory that they were homosexual lovers, which was both untrue and\nirrelevant to the intelligence secrets that they had compromised. It\nis certainly possible that the government put out information to\nintentionally defame Snowden. Secretary of State John Kerry characterized\nhim as a coward who should “man up” by returning to the\nUnited States.\nWhile one can discount such characterizations against Snowden\nby government officials as demonization, as I do, one cannot as easily\ndismiss the independent evidence that undermines Snowden’s\nassertion that his sole motive was blowing the whistle on illicit surveillance\nin the United States. For example, in 2014, the Lawfare\nInstitute, a nonprofit organization that publishes a blog on national\nsecurity concerns, in cooperation with the Brookings Institution,\ndid an independent analysis of all the published documents that\nSnowden provided to the media. It concluded that with some notable\nexceptions, such as the two documents initially published by The\nGuardian and the Post, the now- famous FISA Verizon warrant and\nthe PRISM slides, few of the other documents that Snowden had\ngiven Poitras and Greenwald for publication had anything to do\nwith either domestic surveillance or infringements on the privacy of\nAmericans. By the Lawfare Institute’s count, 32 of Snowden’s leaks\nto these journalists concerned the NSA’s overseas sources and methods,\n9 identified overseas locations of the NSA’s intelligence bases,\n25 revealed the identities of foreign officials of interest to U.S. intelligence\nagencies, 14 disclosed information about Internet companies\nlegally cooperating with the NSA, and 19 concerned technology\nproducts that the NSA had been using or researching.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 115\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n116 | how america lost its secrets\nSome secret methods that Snowden made public compromised\nthe NSA’s state- of- the- art technology of which adversaries had\nbeen unaware. For example, the NSA had devised an ingenious technology\nin 2008 for tapping into computers abroad that had been\n“air- gapped,” or intentionally isolated from any network to protect\nhighly sensitive information, such as missile telemetry, nuclear bomb\ndevelopment, and cyber- warfare capabilities. The secret method that\nthe NSA used involved surreptitiously implanting speck- sized circuit\nboards into air- gapped computers. These devices then covertly\ntransmitted the data back in bursts of radio waves. Once Snowden\nexposed this technology, and the radio frequency transmission it\nused, America lost this intelligence capability.\nIn addition, a considerable number of the published documents\ndid not even belong to the NSA but were copies of reports sent to\nthe NSA by its allies, including the British, Australian, Canadian,\nFrench, Norwegian, and Israeli intelligence services. Snowden provided\njournalists with secret documents from the British cyber\nservice GCHQ, describing its plans to obtain a legal warrant to penetrate\nthe Russian computer security firm Kaspersky to expand its\n“computer network exploitation capability.” What the GCHQ was\nrevealing in this secret document was its own capabilities to monitor\na Russian target of interest to British intelligence. While the release\nof these foreign documents might have embarrassed allies of the\nUnited States, they exposed no violations of U.S. law by the NSA. It\nwas a legitimate part of the NSA’s job to share information with its\nallies. This raises the question: What constitutes whistle- blowing?\nTo the general public no doubt, a whistle- blower is simply a person\nwho exposes government misdeeds from inside that government.\nBut in the eyes of the law, someone who discloses classified\ninformation to an unauthorized person, even as an act of personal\nconscience, is not exempt from the punitive consequences of this act.\nIndeed, if a person deliberately reveals secret U.S. operations, especially\nones that compromise the sources and methods of U.S. intelligence\nservices, he or she may run afoul of American espionage laws.\nIn the past, when government employees have disclosed highly\nclassified information to journalists to redress perceived government\nmisconduct, they were almost always prosecuted. During\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 116\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Great Divide | 117\nBarack Obama’s presidency, there were six government employees\nwho, as a matter of personal conscience, shared classified information\nthey obtained from the FBI, the CIA, the State Department,\nand the U.S. Army with journalists. They were all convicted: Shamai\nLeibowitz in 2010, Chelsea Manning in 2013, John Kiriakou in\n2013, Donald Sachtleben in 2013, Stephen Kim in 2014, and Jeffrey\nSterling in 2014. Like Snowden, they claimed to be whistle- blowers\ninforming the public of government abuses. But because they disclosed\nclassified documents, they were dealt with as lawbreakers. All\nsix were indicted, tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison. Sterling,\na CIA officer who allegedly turned over a document to James Risen,\na Pulitzer Prize– winning reporter for the Times, was sentenced to\nforty- two months. The most severe sentence was meted out to Private\nManning, whom an army court sentenced to thirty- five years\nin a military stockade, as noted earlier.\nThe prison time that others received did not go unnoticed by\nSnowden. He had been following the Manning case since 2012. In\nfact, he posted about it shortly before he began stealing far more\ndamaging documents than Manning had. He would therefore likely\nhave been aware that by revealing state secrets he had sworn to protect,\nhe would be risking imprisonment unless, unlike Manning, he\nfled the country. His motives, no matter how noble they might be,\nwould not spare him— any more than they spared the other six—\nfrom determined federal prosecution.\nThe view of those on the Snowden side of the divide is grounded\nnot in legal definitions but in a broader notion of morality. Snowden’s\nsupporters do not accept that the law should be applied to Snowden\nin this fashion. A writer for The New Yorker termed it “an act of\ncivil disobedience.” His supporters argue that Snowden had a moral\nimperative to act, even if it meant breaking the law. They fully accept\nhis view that he had a higher duty to protect citizens of all countries\nin the world from, as he put it, “secret pervasive surveillance.”\nThat higher duty transcended any narrower legal definitions of lawbreaking.\nBen Wizner, a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties\nUnion who has represented Snowden since October 2013, argues\nthat Snowden’s taking of classified documents was an “act of conscience”\nthat overrode any legal constraints because it “revitalized\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 117\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n118 | how america lost its secrets\ndemocratic oversight in the U.S.” and, without question, caused a\nmuch- needed debate on government surveillance.\nIn this ends- justify- the- means view, any person with access to\ngovernment secrets can authorize him- or herself to reveal those\nsecrets to the world if she or he believes it serves the public good.\nFurther, because doing so would be an “act of conscience,” he or she\nshould be immune from legal prosecution.\nFor Snowden’s supporters, his “act of conscience” justifies his\nclaim to being a whistle- blower, even though the preponderance of\nthe secrets he disclosed had to do with the NSA’s authorized activity\nof using its multibillion- dollar global arrays of sensors to intercept\ndata in foreign countries. For example, one of the thirty allied\nintelligence services that the NSA cooperated with in 2013 was the\ncyber service of Israel. Because Snowden deemed this cooperation\nto infringe on privacy rights, he revealed documents bearing on\nthe NSA’s data exchange with Israel. He subsequently told James\nBamford, in an interview in Wired magazine in August 2014, that\nsupplying such intelligence to Israel was “one of the biggest abuses\nwe’ve seen.” Snowden therefore believed he was justified in revealing\ninformation concerning Arab communications in Gaza, the West\nBank, and Lebanon that the NSA had provided the Israeli cyber service,\nknown as Unit 8200. In doing so, he compromised an Israeli\nsource. But how could this act qualify as whistle- blowing? Providing\nIsrael with such data was not some NSA rogue operation. It was part\nof a policy that had been approved by every American president—\nand every Congress— since 1948. Snowden had every right to personally\ndisagree with this established U.S. policy of aiding Israel with\nintelligence, but it is another matter to release secret documents to\nsupport his view. If the concept of whistle- blowing were expanded\nto cover intelligence workers who steal secrets because they disagree\nwith their government’s foreign policy, it would also have to include\nmany notorious spies, such as Kim Philby.\nSnowden’s concept of whistle- blowing also applied to the NSA’s\nspying on adversary nations. “We’ve crossed lines,” Snowden said\nin regard to China. “We’re hacking universities and hospitals and\nwholly civilian infrastructure.” The NSA’s operations against China\nwere such “a real concern” for Snowden that he targeted lists of\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 118\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Great Divide | 119\nthe NSA’s penetrations in China. Putin echoed this expansion of the\nwhistle- blowing concept to adversaries. He complimented Snowden\nfor having “uncovered illegal acts by the United States around the\nglobe.” Putin’s defense of Snowden not only implied a global concept\nof whistle- blowing that justifies breaking U.S. laws but also pointed\nto America’s double standard in publicly complaining about Russian\nand Chinese cyber espionage.\nSnowden’s whistle- blower interpretation gained immense public\nresonance. Even after President Obama and leaders of both houses\nof Congress roundly denounced Snowden for betraying American\nsecrets, the majority of the public, according to a Quinnipiac poll\ntaken in July 2013, still considered “Snowden a whistleblower who\ndid a service revealing government domestic spying programs.”\nMoreover, Snowden’s revelations helped stoke a growing distrust of\nthe American government itself. According to polls conducted by\nthe Pew Research Center after Snowden came forward, just 19 percent\nof the public said that “they can trust the government always\nor most of the time.” The support for Snowden was not limited to\nAmerica. On October 29, 2015, a majority of the European Parliament\nvoted to award Snowden the official status of a “human rights\ndefender.”\nThe former congressman Ron Paul went even further. He organized\na clemency petition in February 2014 for Snowden, stating,\n“Thanks to one man’s courageous actions, Americans know about\nthe truly egregious ways their government is spying on them,” and\nhis son Senator Rand Paul, who was a candidate for the Republican\npresidential nomination in 2016, called for a pardon for Snowden.\nSenator Paul’s concern fitted with the growing public apprehension\nover increasing intrusion on privacy. Snowden was correct,\nin my opinion, in describing the threat of a surveillance state and\nthe loss of privacy as a legitimate public concern. “We actually buy\ncell phones that are the equivalent of a network microphone that\nwe carry around in our pockets voluntarily,” he pointed out from\nMoscow.\nThe very technology involved in the electronic equipment we all\nuse in the twenty- first century has made mass surveillance part of\nour daily life. There can be little doubt that our privacy has been\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 119\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n120 | how america lost its secrets\nlargely eroded, if not entirely negated, by the widespread use of\ncell phones, credit cards, social media, and the search engines of the\nInternet. When we use smart phones, our location is relayed to our\ntelephone service provider every three seconds. The phone companies\ncollect and archive our phone usage “metadata,” which includes\nwhom we called and how long we spoke. When we use Google\nto search for anyone or anything on the Internet, that activity is\ncaptured by Google, a company whose profits mainly come from\nmaking available to advertisers the results of its surveillance and\ncollection of its users’ searches. When we use Gmail, Google’s e- mail\nservice, used by nearly one billion senders and recipients, we agree\nto allow Google to read the actual contents of our correspondence to\nfind keywords of interest to advertisers.\nWhen we use a credit card, the credit card company also retains\ndata about what we buy and where we go. When we travel in automobiles\nequipped with GPS, every turn and stop is tracked and\nrecorded. And when we are in public places with CCTV (closedcircuit\ntelevision) cameras, our image is recorded and archived.\nWhen we use Facebook, Twitter, and other so- called social media, as\nover two billion people do today, we allow these companies to collect,\nretain, and exploit their surveillance of our movements, associations\nwith other people, and stated preferences. When we use Amazon and\nother online stores, we allow them to track and archive a great deal\nof our commercial activity. For Internet companies such as Facebook,\nTwitter, and Yahoo!, like Google, collecting private data on hundreds\nof millions of their members provides them with vast searchable\ndatabases that are easily marketable. The exploitation of these databases\nis a fundamental aspect of their business plans. Without such\nsurveillance of their users, social media companies would not be able\nto turn a profit. Indeed, they may be more aptly called surveillance\nmedia than social media. For those of us who use them to post pictures\nand communicate, any notion of personal privacy is largely\nillusory.\nTo be sure, there is a distinction to be made between the surveillance\nof our activities to which we voluntarily agree in exchange\nfor the benefits and conveniences that we gain from social media,\nsearch engines, and other Internet companies and the surveillance\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 120\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Great Divide | 121\ndone by the government, which we do not voluntarily invite— or\nwant. We willingly waive our privacy for corporations but not for\ngovernments.\nWhat the public might not fully realize, however, is that the government\ncan access all the personal information in the databases of\nprivate companies if it issues a subpoena or search warrant, which it\ndoes often. As Snowden himself pointed out, “If Facebook is going\nto hand over all of your messages, all of your wall posts, all of your\nprivate photos, all of your private details from their server, the government\nhas no need to intercept all of the communications that constitute\nthose private records.” These Internet companies, even if they\nare only interested in exploiting the data for their own profit, cannot\nrefuse to share this information with the NSA, the FBI, and other\ngovernment agencies if they have a subpoena or search warrant.\nThat reality became evident to me in my investigation of the rape\ncharges brought (and subsequently dropped) against Dominique\nStrauss- Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary\nFund, in 2011. Immediately after his arrest, Cyrus Vance Jr., the district\nattorney of New York County, issued a subpoena for Strauss-\nKahn’s cell phone records, credit card records, hotel room electronic\nkey records, e- mails, room service bills, and the CCTV videos of his\nactivities (some of which I published in my article about the case\nin The New York Review of Books). Nor is this access uncommon.\nAccording to Vance in 2016, his office issues thousands of such subpoenas\nevery year. Even though Apple made headlines by refusing\nto comply with a court order to help the FBI unlock the iPhone of\na dead mass murderer in 2016, it had complied with many previous\nsubpoenas. In fact, in 2015 alone, it quietly provided the backed- up\ndata of some seventy- one hundred iPhone customers to government\nauthorities.\nIf anyone doubts the pervasiveness of government data collection,\nconsider a little- known government agency called the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau. Created in 2010 by Congress, it mines\ndata on a monthly basis from some 600 million personal credit card\naccounts, targeting about 95 percent of the credit card users in the\nUnited States. In addition, through eleven other data- mining programs,\nit gathers data on everything from private home mortgages\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 121\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n122 | how america lost its secrets\nand student loans to credit scores and overdrafts in personal bank\naccounts. This ubiquitous surveillance of virtually every non-cash\ntransaction came about because of advances in computer technology\nthat made it economically feasible to mine such data.\nSnowden’s concern about NSA domestic surveillance is certainly\nnot misplaced. Ever since the 9/11 attacks, the NSA has increasingly\nplayed a role in this surveillance state, not by its own choice, but\nbecause Congress mandated it. In 2001, it empowered the NSA to\nobtain and archive data on American citizens. Accordingly, the NSA\nobtained the billing records of customers from phone and Internet\ncompanies and archived these records. The bulk collection of these\nbilling records was intended to build a searchable database for the\ngovernment that could be used to trace the history of the telephone\nand Internet activities in the United States of FBI- designated foreign\nterrorists and spies abroad. The government’s rationale for keeping\nthese anti-terrorist programs secret from the public was that it did\nnot want the foreign suspects to realize their communications in\nAmerica were being monitored.\nThe public only learned that the phone company was routinely\nturning over its billing records on June 6, 2013, when Snowden disclosed\nit to The Guardian and The Washington Post. The documents\nhe provided the journalists showed that the NSA had been obtaining\nphone records collected by Verizon every three months. While\nthis revelation might have shocked the American public, the NSA\nhad not acted on its own. It had acted under a warrant issued by a\nsecret court established by Congress in 1978 as part of the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act for each request for records. Congress\nempowered the FISA court, whose judges are appointed by the president,\nto hear cases and authorize search warrants in secret in cases\ninvolving national security.\nAs its name implies, the FISA court was meant to deal with matters\nbearing on foreign intelligence activities in the United States. That\nrestriction changed after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\nA month after the attacks, Congress expanded the purview of the\nFISA court by passing the USA Patriot Act (an acronym that stands\nfor Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate\nTools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism). Part of the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 122\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Great Divide | 123\nact, Section 215, euphemistically referred to as the “library records”\nprovision, permitted the FISA court to issue warrants authorizing\nsearches of records by the NSA and other federal agencies to investigate\ninternational terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.\nThrough these FISA authorizations, the NSA could obtain “tangible\nthings” such as “books, records, papers, documents, and other items.”\nUnder the interpretation of this section of the law by both the Bush\nand the Obama administrations, the FISA court was enabled by\nCongress to issue warrants to telephone companies demanding that\nthey turn over to the NSA the bulk billing records of all calls made\nin America. The FISA court need only deem these records to be “relevant”\nto the FBI’s investigations of terrorists and spies.\nEssentially, the NSA, to create a searchable database of telephone\nbilling records, used the FISA court’s controversial interpretation of\nthe word “relevant” in Section 215. Such a “haystack,” as the NSA\ncalled the national collection of billing records, could allow the FBI\nto instantly find missing “needles,” as this tracking was supposed to\nwork, even if the connections were made years earlier. For example,\nif the FBI had a lead on a foreign suspect, it could search the database\nfor any telephone calls made by the foreign suspect to telephone\nnumbers in America and then who those people called. The\nFBI always had this power, if it obtained a warrant, but it did not\npreviously have the “haystack” of records in a single database. General\nKeith Alexander, who headed the NSA between 2005 and 2014,\nbelieved that maintaining such a haystack database made sense. “His\napproach was, ‘Let’s collect the whole haystack,’ ” according to one\nformer senior U.S. intelligence official quoted by The Washington\nPost.\nAccording to critics of NSA domestic surveillance, including the\nACLU, the results provided by this vast database did not justify its\nimmense potential for abuse. In early May 2015, just three weeks\nbefore this part of the Patriot Act was set to expire, a three- judge\npanel of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York\nagreed with the ACLU position, overturning a lower court decision\nthat said it was legal. The panel found that the word “relevant”\nin the act was not intended by Congress to justify the acquisition\nand storing of the bulk records of telephone companies for possible\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 123\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n124 | how america lost its secrets\nfuture use. Soon afterward, Congress replaced the Patriot Act with\nthe USA Freedom Act, which effectively transferred bulk storage of\nbilling records from the NSA to the phone companies themselves.\nDespite the change in venue, the records of individuals were still not\ncompletely private. Under the new law, the FBI via a FISA warrant\ncould still search the phone company’s databases.\nThe core of Snowden’s charge in the media was that the FISA\ncourt overreached its authority by issuing sweeping warrants that\nallowed the NSA to obtain data collected by private phone and Internet\ncompanies. In the initial story published in The Guardian on\nJune 6, Snowden disclosed one such FISA warrant to support his\ncharge. It was issued by Judge Roger Vinson of the FISA court on\nApril 25, 2013, and ordered Verizon to turn over to the FBI all its\nbilling records of landline customers for the next ninety days. The\nFBI presented this FISA authorization to the NSA, which acts as\na service organization for the FBI and the CIA in collecting communications\ndata. The NSA, with the FISA warrant in hand, then\nobtained the Verizon billing records.\nSnowden also provided the Post and The Guardian with another\nsecret document: a PowerPoint presentation on twenty slides, sent\nby the NSA to other intelligence agencies. It described a program\nit was using for monitoring the Internet. Its code name was the\naforementioned PRISM. It was authorized under Section 702 of the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act and was designed to collect\nmessages sent over the Internet from foreigners. Such information\nwas in fact obtained with the knowledge of the service providers. It\nalso required a written directive from both the attorney general and\nthe director of national intelligence and a review by the Department\nof Justice every three months for each and every case. After obtaining\nthis data, the NSA ran programs, as required by law, to filter out\nall domestic Internet communications, but, as Snowden pointed out,\ndomestic information was also accidently picked up. Whenever the\nJustice Department actually opened an investigation against Americans\nin contact with foreign suspects, as it did in 170 cases in 2013,\nit could obtain warrants from the FISA court to search these Americans’\nInternet activities.\nThese two documents raised legitimate questions for many\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 124\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Great Divide | 125\nAmericans, including members of Congress, about the proper role\nof the FISA court, including whether it should conduct its business\nin secret. If Snowden had released only these two documents that\nrelated to unwarranted domestic surveillance and other possible violations\nof the law by the NSA, it would be difficult for any reasonable\nperson not to see his actions as a potentially valuable public service.\nIndeed, additional safeguards were necessary in an age in which new\ntechnologies enabled mass surveillance of the public. As the threejudge\npanel of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would later\nfind, Congress had not intended Section 215 of the Patriot Act to\nbe used to justify the bulk collection of American records. If he had\nlimited his illegal downloading to the few documents about bulk collection,\nit would be more difficult to argue that he was not a whistleblower\nin the spirit if not the letter of the law, and even a hero in\nthe struggle to preserve our civil liberties. But in fact, Snowden took\na great many other secret documents that did not bear on the civil\nliberties of Americans. He claimed he was acting on behalf of citizens\nin foreign countries by exposing the NSA’s and the CIA’s spying\noperations abroad, but that same claim could also be made by any\nespionage agent stealing U.S. secrets to benefit the people of another\ncountry.\nAs a result, the Snowden case produced a great divide in the\nAmerican appreciation of him. On one hand, he has been almost\nuniversally lauded and lionized by what might be seen as the mainstream\nmedia, by numerous academics, and even, as we have seen,\nby members of Congress. The journalists who assisted him, Greenwald,\nPoitras, and Gellman, have been celebrated for the roles they\nplayed in bringing Snowden’s revelations to the public and received\nthe 2014 Polk Award for national security reporting. The Post and\nThe Guardian, the newspapers that initially published the purloined\ndocuments, won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for public service.\nIn other circles, the reaction has been very different. American\nand British intelligence officials, senior members of the Obama\nadministration, and members of the oversight committees of Congress\ndo not view Snowden as a hero or even an authentic whistleblower.\nInstead, they see him as a betrayer of secrets who willfully\nbrought damage to the United States and benefits to its adversar-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 125\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n126 | how america lost its secrets\nies. The holders of this darker view of Snowden base it on classified\nreports of the full extent of the theft of classified data. Those officials\nbelieve that only a handful of the tens of thousands of documents he\nstole involved domestic surveillance and that those few documents\nserved as a cover for a much larger theft.\nAdmiral Michael Rogers, who replaced General Alexander as\nhead of the NSA in March 2014, said at a public forum at Princeton\nUniversity, “Edward Snowden is not the ‘whistleblower’ some have\nlabeled him to be.” He further explained to Congress, “Snowden\nstole from the United States government a large amount of classified\ninformation, a small portion of which is germane to his apparent\ncentral argument regarding NSA and privacy issues.”\nGeneral Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\nwent even further. In testifying before the House Armed Services\nCommittee on March 6, 2014, after estimating that the Snowden\nbreach could cost the military “billions” to repair, he added, “The\nvast majority of the electronic documents that Snowden exfiltrated\nfrom our highest levels of security had nothing to do with exposing\ngovernment oversight of domestic activities.” Dempsey based this\nassessment on a then still- secret Defense Intelligence Agency report\non the breach. The classified DIA report showed that Snowden took\n“over 900,000” military files from the Department of Defense in\naddition to the NSA files he had taken. The Defense Department\nloss in terms of the number of files stolen actually exceeded the\nloss— in sheer numbers— of NSA documents. Lieutenant General\nMike Flynn, the DIA director who directed the study, testified to the\nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence that the breach “has caused\ngrave damage to our national security.”\nTo be sure, this was not the first time that the cryptological\nbranches of the military had been compromised. The spy ring of John\nWalker had provided thousands of the navy’s reports on breaking\nRussian ciphers to the KGB during the Cold War. But the Snowden\nbreach exposing military sources was an order of magnitude greater\nthan any past breach.\nThe CIA’s assessment was no less grim. Morell, the deputy director\nof the CIA in 2013, wrote that Snowden’s action went beyond taking\nthe handful of documents, such as the FISA order, “that addressed\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 126\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Great Divide | 127\nthe privacy issue.” Instead, as Morell put it, “he backed up a virtual\ntractor trailer and emptied a warehouse full of documents— the vast\nmajority of which he could not possibly have read and few of which\nhe would likely understand— [and] he delivered the documents to a\nvariety of news organizations and God knows who else.” As a result,\nMorell concluded, “Snowden’s disclosures will go down in history\nas the greatest compromise of classified information ever.” General\nAlexander, the head of the NSA at the time of the theft, asserted that\nSnowden did “the greatest damage to our combined nations’ intelligence\nsystems that we have ever suffered.” Obviously, military\nintelligence officers would not be on Snowden’s side of the divide\n(and the Snowden breach ended the careers of many of them, including\nAlexander). But political leaders in both parties could also be\nfound on the anti- Snowden side of the divide. “I don’t look at this as\nbeing a whistle- blower,” the Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein of\nCalifornia, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said after\nshe was briefed on Snowden’s theft. “I think it’s an act of treason.”\nThe Republican representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, her counterpart\non the House Intelligence Committee, said on the NBC program\nMeet the Press that Snowden might be working for a foreign\nintelligence service. And a former prominent member of President\nObama’s cabinet went even further, suggesting to me off the record\nin March 2016 that there are only three possible explanations for the\nSnowden heist: (1) it was a Russian espionage operation; (2) it was a\nChinese espionage operation; (3) it was a joint Sino- Russian operation.\nThese severe accusations generated much heat but little light.\nThey were not accompanied by any evidence showing that Snowden\nhad acted in concert with any foreign power in stealing the files or,\nfor that matter, that he was not acting out of his own personal convictions,\nno matter how misguided they might have been.\nOn this side of the divide, Snowden’s critics regard the whistleblowing\nnarrative as at best incomplete and at worst fodder for the\nnaive. They point out that the FISA document that gave him credentials\nas a whistle- blower was only issued in the last week of April\n2013, which was four months after he first contacted Greenwald and\nalmost nine months after he began illegally copying secret documents.\nThey further believe that the evidence contradicts Snowden’s\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 127\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n128 | how america lost its secrets\nclaims that he stole only documents that exposed NSA transgressions\ninto domestic surveillance, that he turned over all the stolen\ndocuments to journalists, and that he was forced to remain in Moscow\nby the actions of the U.S. government. They also find that the\nunprecedented size and complexity of the penetration of NSA files,\ncompromising hundreds of thousands of secret documents pertaining\nto U.S. operations against adversary nations, according to the\nNSA’s and the Pentagon’s estimates, is not easily explained given\nSnowden’s avowed purpose for his theft.\nThe deep split in how Snowden is perceived brings to mind the\nfamous drawing of a duck- rabbit cartoon first published in 1900 in\nthe book Fact and Fable in Psychology. The figure is perceived either\nas a duck or as a rabbit, but it cannot be seen as both simultaneously.\nWhether a person sees a rabbit or a duck in this test may depend\non the information available to that person. Similarly, what may\naccount for the sharp divide between the pro- Snowden and the anti-\nSnowden camps is a disparity in their available information.\nThe pro- Snowden camp’s view is largely informed by Snowden\nhimself. Snowden supporters prefer to believe his words rather than\nhis actions. In the anti- Snowden camp are administration officials\nand the members of the House and Senate intelligence oversight\ncommittees who have been at least partially briefed on the continuing\ninvestigations of the Snowden affair. The members of the\nSenate Intelligence Committee, for example, were told by David\nLeatherwood, the director of operations for the Defense Intelligence\nAgency, that the military files compromised by Snowden included\ndocuments bearing on military plans and weapons systems; foreign\ngovernments’ intelligence activities (including special activities),\nintelligence sources, or methods of cryptology; scientific and technological\nmatters relating to national security; and vulnerable systems,\ninstallations, infrastructures, projects, plans, and protection services\nrelated to national security and the development, production, or use\nof weapons of mass destruction. The members of the House and\nSenate Intelligence Committees, but not the public, have also been\nprivy to an NSA investigation that established the chronology of\nSnowden’s actions, including changing jobs, copying more than one\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 128\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Great Divide | 129\nmillion classified documents at the Signals Intelligence Center in\nHawaii, and flying to Russia.\nAdditional information does not necessarily change the minds of\npeople who already have a firm view. In the field of social psychology,\nthe testing of “confirmation theory” consistently shows that\npeople tend to more readily reject new information that contradicts\ntheir pre-existing beliefs. For example, when Lee Harvey Oswald\nwas arrested in the Texas Theater on November 22, 1963, he said\nfamously, “I haven’t shot anybody.” Ten months later, the Warren\nCommission presented evidence, including ballistic tests, that it\nclaimed showed that Oswald had shot three people, including President\nJohn F. Kennedy, less than an hour before making his statement.\nYet many of those who believed Oswald’s public proclamation of\nhis innocence chose to believe that the government had falsified\nall the incriminating evidence to tarnish Oswald (who had been\nkilled on November 24, 1963) rather than accept that they had\nbeen wrong in believing Oswald.\nThe charges, countercharges, and defamatory name- calling in the\nSnowden case therefore only deepened the great divide. Those who\nsaw Snowden as a democratic hero exposing the abuses of power of\nan out- of- control national security state tended to dismiss anything\nthat depicted Snowden in a negative light as a fabrication, while\nthose who saw Snowden as a “traitor” tended to dismiss anything\nthat depicted him in a more positive light.\nWhen it comes to the murky universe of spy agencies, the problem\nin deciding where the truth lies is further heightened by the\npossibility of deliberate deception. Spy masters are, after all, in the\nbusiness of concealing their most sensitive operations. It is often\nconsidered essential that important secrets be protected by what\nWinston Churchill famously termed “a bodyguard of lies.” Top\nintelligence officials are not exempt from this practice. Consider, for\nexample, the response to a question concerning the NSA’s operations\nmade by James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, to\nthe Senate Intelligence Committee on March 12, 2013. The Democratic\nsenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who was on the committee,\nasked the spymaster if the NSA collected data on Americans. Clap-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 129\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n130 | how america lost its secrets\nper answered that the NSA did not knowingly “collect any type of\ndata” on millions of Americans. Clapper’s answer was clearly untrue,\nbut it did not mislead Senator Wyden or any other members of the\nSenate Intelligence Committee; Clapper had truthfully testified in a\nclassified session of the committee earlier that week that the NSA\ndid collect Americans’ telephone records. It was the American people\nwho were being misled. Yet none of the senators on the committee\ncorrected this obviously false answer. When Clapper realized he had\nmisspoken, he could not publicly correct the record of the public session,\nbecause to do so would be revealing classified information he\nhad sworn to protect. No doubt other intelligence officers find themselves\nin a similar bind in discussing secret matters. This suggests\nthat there is a risk in accepting statements made by the intelligence\nchiefs at face value.\nBut Snowden also has a credibility problem. He has told numerous\nuntruths, including some calculated to help him insinuate himself\ninto the key positions from which he stole secrets and some calculated\nto cover up the nature of his theft. For example, Snowden got\naccess in the spring of 2013 to the NSA’s super-secret computers that\nstored these electronic files by working at Booz Allen Hamilton. On\nhis application to Booz Allen in March 2013, as we’ve seen, Snowden\nclaimed to be in the process of completing a master’s degree at the\nUniversity of Liverpool in computer security sciences. Snowden had\nnot completed a single course there and purposely lied to get access\nto classified documents and then to get safely away with them.\nHe was also not entirely truthful with the journalists whose\ntrust he sought when it suited his purpose of protecting himself.\nFor example, as we have seen, in contacting Laura Poitras under the\nalias Citizen Four in January 2013, he told her that he was currently\na “government employee,” although in fact he was working for a\nprivate contractor at the time.\nSnowden had little concern about misleading journalists when\nit suited his purpose. For example, he told Alan Rusbridger of The\nGuardian, Brian Williams of NBC News, James Bamford of Wired,\nKatrina vanden Heuvel of The Nation, Barton Gellman, and Jane\nMayer of The New Yorker that the U.S. government intentionally\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 130\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Great Divide | 131\nacted to “trap” him in Moscow by revoking his passport while he\nwas already on a plane to Moscow on the afternoon of June 23.\nNone of these journalists asked Snowden what the basis for his oftrepeated\nallegation was. If they had, they would have discovered that\nhe had no independent basis for his assertion. When asked about it\nduring the Q&A following his July 12 press conference in Moscow,\nhe indeed said that the only knowledge he had about the suspension\nof his passport was what he had “read” in the news reports. But\nall the news stories prior to his statement reported that his passport\nhad been revoked on June 22, while he was still in Hong Kong.\nABC News, for example, reported that the U.S. “Consul General–\nHong Kong confirmed Hong Kong authorities were notified that Mr.\nSnowden’s passport was revoked June 22.” By advancing that date\nto when his plane was in “midair” on June 23, Snowden provided to\nunsuspecting journalists an untrue alibi for his presence in Russia.\nThe credibility problem with Snowden assumed a more sinister\ndimension once he put himself and his fate in the hands of the Russian\nauthorities in Moscow. Even though the Obama administration\ndecided against revealing the extent of the Russian intelligence service’s\nparticipation in Snowden’s move from Hong Kong to Moscow,\nor what intelligence services call an “exfiltration,” I was told\nby a presidential national security staff adviser that the government\nacted to protect the intelligence sources used by the CIA, the NSA,\nand the FBI to track Snowden’s movements in the latter part of June\nin Hong Kong. The CIA’s deputy director, Morell, would go no further\nthan to state that during that period he had no doubt that the\nintelligence services of Russia and China “had an enormous interest\nin him and the information he [Snowden] had stolen.” Presumably,\nthe last thing these adversary services would want would be to make\nthis “interest” transparent to the United States.\nThe role of concealment must be taken into account when assessing\ninformation bearing on the work of espionage services. When\nI was interviewing James Jesus Angleton— the CIA’s legendary excounterintelligence\nchief, active in the 1970s— for a book on deception,\nI learned that intelligence services play by a different set of\nrules from historians when it comes to their espionage successes.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 131\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n132 | how america lost its secrets\nAngleton, a famously baroque thinker himself, impressed on me the\ncomplexity of espionage. He said, “It’s not enough just to steal a\nsecret. It must be done in a way that the theft remains undetected.”\nDeception is employed to obscure the nature and the extent of\nthe espionage theft. One of the most famous examples of this principle\nwas the deception used by British intelligence in World War II\nto conceal its success in breaking the German ciphers generated by\nthe Enigma machines. If German naval intelligence had discovered\nBritain was able to read the ciphers it used to communicate with its\nU- boats, it would have stopped using them. So British intelligence\nhid its coup by supplying false information to known German spies\nto account for the sinking of U- boats, including the canard that British\naerial cameras could detect one ingredient in the paint used to\ncamouflage the U- boats.\nThat same hoary principle of deception applies to modern- day\ncommunications intelligence. If the Russian, Chinese, or any other\nadversary intelligence service got its hands on the documents stolen\nby Snowden from the NSA’s repositories in Hawaii in 2013, it would\nlikely employ deception, including well- crafted lies, to create as\nmuch ambiguity as possible as to the missing documents. From this\ncounterintelligence perspective, the intelligence issue that spawned\nthe great divide cannot be resolved by accepting the uncorroborated\nstatements made by a source, such as Snowden, who may be in the\nhands of the Russian security services in Moscow.\nBy the same token, the calculations made by NSA officials about\nthe extent of the theft are also suspect. After all, the NSA is an intelligence\nservice that often engages in secret machinations. We know\nthat its top officials reported to the House and Senate Intelligence\nCommittees, as well as the president’s national security adviser, that\nSnowden compromised over one million documents. But if this was\ndisinformation, it is difficult to see its purpose. Inflating the extent\nof the damage of the Snowden breach to the president, Congress,\nand the secretary of defense obviously reflected poorly on their own\nmanagement of the NSA, and their own careers. Yet such a possibility\ncannot be precluded in the arcane world of intelligence.\nAs in any case involving the loss of state secrets, uncontested facts\nremain in extremely short supply. The opinion- laden appellatives\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 132\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Great Divide | 133\nsuch as “patriot” and “traitor” that have tended to fill the gap in\nthe great divide do little to address the important mystery of how\nmany thousands of state secrets were taken from the United States.\nHow did Snowden breach the supposedly formidable defenses of the\nNSA? Did he have any assistance? How did he escape to Moscow?\nAnd what was the final destination of the stolen documents? How\nSnowden succeeded in this coup cannot simply be pieced together\nfrom his own statements and interviews. The story also requires a\nvisit into the wilderness of mirrors of a counterintelligence investigation.\nFor this endeavor, it is necessary to return to the crime scene:\nthe NSA’s base in Hawaii.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 133\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nc h a p t e r 14\nThe Crime Scene Investigation\nAny private contractor, not even an employee of the government,\ncould walk into the NSA building, take whatever they wanted,\nand walk out with it and they would never know.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2014\nFifteen miles northwest of Honolulu on the island of Oahu,\nadjacent to the sprawling Wheeler Air Force Base, is a 250,000-\nsquare- foot, man- made mound of earth and reinforced concrete surrounded\nby an electrified fence. Inside the mound is a three- story\nstructure originally built by the air force in World War II as a bombproof\naircraft repair facility. In the Cold War, it was modernized to\nwithstand enemy chemical, biological, radiological, or electromagnetic\npulse attacks and was used by the navy’s operation center for\nits Pacific fleet. After the Cold War, the huge edifice was turned over\nto the NSA, which, as stated earlier, had been created as an intelligence\nservice to intercept the communications and signals of foreign\ncountries after World War II, a mission that included vacuuming\ninto its giant computer arrays telephone messages, missile telemetry,\nsubmarine signals, and virtually everything on the electromagnetic\nspectrum of interest to the U.S. Defense Department and\nU.S. intelligence agencies. As the NSA developed it, this Hawaiian\nbase became one of its primary regional bases for gathering Asian\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 134\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Crime Scene Investigation | 135\ncommunications intelligence. It provided a valuable window on the\nactivities of adversary nations in the Pacific region and was able to\nmonitor the ballistic missile tests and submarine activities of China,\nNorth Korea, and Russia. By 2013, the Kunia base had a vast array\nof state- of- the- art technology, including ninety Cray supercomputers\narranged in a horseshoe configuration, used to decipher and\nmake sense of the intercepted signals from China, Russia, and North\nKorea. At the heart of the Hawaiian complex was a unit with both\nmilitary and civilian employees. A large share of the civilians who\nran the computers worked under two- year contracts with the NSA’s\nleading civilian contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton.\nGeneral Alexander, who, as I said, headed the NSA in 2013, first\nlearned about an impending story in The Guardian on June 4, while\nhe was in Germany meeting with its top intelligence officials, from\nJanine Gibson, The Guardian’s American website editor. She had\nnotified the NSA it intended to break a story focusing on the organization.\nIt took NSA counterintelligence less than forty- eight hours\nto determine that a civilian employee at the base from which documents\nwere stolen had not reported back to work on May 22. His\ncivilian supervisor had delayed reporting the absence to the NSA\nuntil May 28. It also determined that the missing civilian employee,\nSnowden, had lied on his application for a medical leave and had\nflown to Hong Kong. Personal records showed he was being trained\nas an analyst at the Threat Operations Center and had worked there\nfor less than six weeks. He had taken the medical leave on May 18\nand left the country by plane. By June 6, he had become the NSA’s\nmain suspect.\nAlexander flew to Washington, D.C., after assigning the sensitive\njob of investigating the breach to a team headed by Richard\n“Rick” Ledgett, who was then director of the NSA’s Threat Operations\nCenter at the NSA’s headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland.\nLedgett was the logical choice to head the damage assessment investigation\nbecause the center’s regional branch in Hawaii was under\nhis command. Ledgett flew to Hawaii, where his first task was to\nreconstruct the chronology of Snowden’s moves, or, as the tactic is\ncalled in counterintelligence parlance, “walking the cat back.”\nThe NSA had also notified the FBI of Snowden’s possible involve-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 135\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n136 | how america lost its secrets\nment in the theft of state secrets in the first week of June. The FBI\nis in charge of criminal investigations of civilian U.S. intelligence\nworkers, even if the alleged crime occurs on an NSA base. The FBI\nimmediately dispatched a task force of agents to investigate a potential\nespionage case in Hawaii. When questioned, Lindsay Mills said\nSnowden was away on a business trip. After determining from\nairline and hotel data that he was in Hong Kong, the FBI realized\nSnowden was a possible intelligence defector. It froze his credit and\nbank cards. It also notified the passport office in the State Department\nand the legal attachés at the Hong Kong consulate. The legal\nattachés, who were actually FBI field agents posted in Hong Kong,\nlocated Snowden at the Mira hotel on June 8. On the evening of\nJune 9, Snowden revealed in his twelve- minute video posted on the\nGuardian website that he was the source of the stolen NSA documents.\nBecause Hong Kong is part of China, U.S. law enforcement\ndid not have the means to recover them.\nAt that point, determining the magnitude of the theft of documents\nbecame a critical concern of the investigation. Aside from the\nfew dozen documents published by The Guardian and The Washington\nPost, what else had Snowden stolen?\nWithin the next few days, a small army of forensic investigators\nfrom the FBI, the Defense Department, and the “Q” counterintelligence\ndivision of the NSA swarmed onto the NSA base in Hawaii.\nThe proximate crime scene for their investigation was the National\nThreat Operations Center. They examined the cubicle where\nSnowden had last worked and then began retracing all his activities\nat the NSA from 2009 to 2013. To begin with, they needed to\nfind out how many documents from the center had been copied and\ntaken by Snowden.\nMeanwhile, the Defense Intelligence Agency (the Pentagon’s own\nintelligence service) was kept partially in the dark. Although the\nNSA is officially part of the Department of Defense, it operated with\na high degree of autonomy with its own inspector general, investigative\nstaff, and reporting channels. The DIA did not learn from\nthe NSA that Snowden had stolen military documents concerning\nthe joint Cyber Command until July 10. The number of stolen military\ndocuments from the Department of Defense was staggering.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 136\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Crime Scene Investigation | 137\nThe DIA found from its forensic examination that Snowden had\ncopied “over 900,000” military files. Many of these non- NSA files\ncame from the Cyber Command, which had been set up in 2011\nby the NSA and the army, navy, marine, and air force cryptological\nservices to combat the threat of warfare in cyberspace. The loss\nwas considered of such importance that between 200 and 250 military\nintelligence officers worked day and night for the next four\nmonths, according to the DIA’s classified report, to “triage, analyze,\nand assess Department of Defense impacts related to the Snowden\ncompromise.” The job of this unit, called the Joint Staff Mitigation\nOversight Task Force, was to attempt to contain the damage caused\nby the Snowden breach. In many cases, containment meant shutting\ndown NSA operations in China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran so\nthey could not be used to confuse and distract the U.S. military.\nThe NSA and the Defense Department were not the only government\nagencies concerned with determining the extent of the\nbreach. The NSA acted as a service organization for the CIA through\nhandling most if not all of its requests for communications intelligence\nto support both its international espionage and its analytic\noperations. Although the CIA and the NSA were both part of the socalled\nintelligence community, the NSA did not immediately share\nwith the CIA details of the Snowden breach. Despite the immense\npotential damage of the theft, it was not until June 10 that the CIA’s\ndirector, John Owen Brennan, and his deputy, Michael Morell, were\nbriefed by the NSA. When Morell realized how much data Snowden\nhad taken, he was astounded.\n“You might have thought of all the government entities on the\nplanet, the one least vulnerable to such grand theft would have been\nthe NSA,” he wrote. “But it turned out that the NSA had left itself\nvulnerable.” According to Morell, he bluntly told the NSA briefer\nthat it was urgent for the CIA to be brought in on the case. After all,\nthe CIA had employed Snowden only four years earlier. Specifically,\nMorell said, the CIA needed to find out three things: Had CIA documents\nbeen part of Snowden’s haul? How long had Snowden been\nstealing documents? Had Snowden been working “with any foreign\nintelligence service, either wittingly or not”?\nAccording to Morell, the effort to get a direct answer from NSA\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 137\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n138 | how america lost its secrets\nofficials to these three key questions “proved maddeningly difficult.”\nHe found that in mid- June NSA officials with whom he dealt\nwere so “distraught at the massive security breach” that initially\nthey refused to allow even CIA officers to participate in the ongoing\nsecurity review. A former NSA executive told me there was “near\npanic” at the NSA. Finally, Morell called Chris Inglis, a former professor\nof computer science who had risen to be the NSA’s deputy\ndirector at the time of the breach. Inglis, who headed operations for\nthe NSA, told him “the news was not good.” Among the data copied\nby Snowden were a large number of CIA secrets. By the time the\nCIA learned that its secrets had been compromised, Snowden was\nheaded to Russia.\nThe investigation of a crime involving potential espionage is no\neasy task. In this case, it required attempting to solve a jigsaw puzzle\nin which not only were key pieces missing but also, because it\ninvolved adversary intelligence services, some of the found pieces\nmight deliberately have been twisted to mislead the U.S. investigators.\nBy late July, NSA investigators had made their initial assessment.\nThey determined that most of the material had been taken from\nsealed- off areas known in intelligence speak as “compartments,”\nwhich in this case were files stored on computers that were isolated\nfrom any network. Each compartment electronically tracks all the\nactivities that occur in it on its logs, including the password identity\nof any person who has gained entry to any compartment. From a\nforensic examination of these logs, NSA investigators were quickly\nable to reconstruct the timeline of the theft. The logs showed that an\nunauthorized party without proper passwords had begun copying\nfiles in mid- April, which was just days after Snowden began his job\nat the center. The illicit activity ended just before Snowden’s last day\nof work there. So this piece fit in with Snowden’s guilt.\nThe size of the theft was another matter. Ledgett was certainly in\na position to know (in the shake- up that followed, he would replace\nInglis as deputy director of the NSA). According to Ledgett, the perpetrator\nhad “touched” 1.7 million documents, moving from compartment\nto compartment. Of these “touched” documents, according\nto the analysis of the logs, more than one million of them had been\nmoved by the unauthorized party in mid- May to an auxiliary com-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 138\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Crime Scene Investigation | 139\nputer intended to be used for temporary storage by authorized service\npersonnel. Finally, the data was transferred off this auxiliary\ncomputer presumably to thumb drives or other external storage\ndevices. This download occurred just days before Snowden left the\nNSA on May 17, 2013, having told the agency that he needed a medical\nleave of absence.\nThe quantity of stolen documents, 1.7 million, does not necessarily\nreveal the damage and can itself be misleading. Many documents\ndo not reveal current or known sources or methods, and others may\nhave little value to an enemy. And a large portion of the documents\nmight have been duplications. The quality of some of these documents\nis another matter. Just one document that exposed a source\nor method of which enemies are unaware can be of immense value.\nOne such document taken by Snowden provided what Ledgett called\n“a roadmap” to the NSA’s current secret operations, revealing to an\nadversary such as Russia, China, or Iran “what we know, what we\ndon’t know, and, implicitly, a way to protect themselves.” There were\nmany documents in the Snowden breach that met these criteria,\naccording to a national security official at the Obama White House.\nGeneral Alexander closely followed the investigation as it developed\nover the summer of 2013. By then, of course, the whole world\nknew that Snowden had stolen a vast trove of NSA documents.\nAlexander saw major inconsistencies developing between Snowden’s\npersonal account of the theft and what had actually happened. The\ntimeline established by the government’s investigators did not\nmatch Snowden’s story line. “Something is not right,” Alexander\nsaid in an interview.\nFor one thing, Snowden had made the claim to journalists, four\nmonths after he was in Russia, that he had turned over all the\ndocuments he took from the NSA’s compartments to Poitras and\nGreen wald in Hong Kong. On August 18, the investigators had the\nopportunity to examine the files that Snowden had given to Poitras\nand Greenwald. This discovery came when British authorities, under\nSchedule 7 of Britain’s Terrorism Act, detained David Miranda,\nGreen wald’s romantic partner, at Heathrow Airport. Miranda was\nsuspected of acting as a courier for Greenwald and Poitras. According\nto Greenwald’s account, Snowden had given both him and Poi-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 139\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n140 | how america lost its secrets\ntras identical copies of the NSA documents in Hong Kong. When\nGreen wald returned home to Rio de Janeiro, he found his copy was\ncorrupted. But Poitras still had her digital copy of whatever stolen\ndocuments Snowden had distributed to them. So Greenwald dispatched\nMiranda from Rio to Berlin to get a copy of Poitras’s thumb\ndrive. On the return trip, Miranda’s plane stopped at Heathrow,\nwhere British authorities detained him and temporarily took the\nthumb drive from him. Poitras had written out the password for\nGreenwald, and Miranda kept it with the thumb drive. The British\ncopied the contents and shared them with the NSA. As a result,\nthe NSA discovered that Snowden had only given Poitras fifty- eight\nthousand documents. The damage assessment team under Ledgett\ndetermined that some of these documents had been edited out of\nmuch larger documents that the NSA logs showed Snowden had\ncopied. By the count of both the NSA and the Defense Department\nteams, almost one million documents were unaccounted for. What\nhappened to the missing documents?\nThe NSA investigation found that the chronology of the theft\nof documents did not support Snowden’s claim to journalists that\nhe had only been seeking whistle- blowing documents. Most of the\ndocuments he took first did not concern the domestic activities of the\nNSA. Only toward the end of the theft did he copy documents that\nwould qualify as whistle- blowing. The court order to Verizon that\nwas the basis of the initial Guardian exposé was only issued by the\nFISA court on April 27, 2013. The other main whistle- blowing document\nhe revealed, the PowerPoint presentation about PRISM, was\nonly issued in April 2013. Yet Snowden had been downloading documents\nfor at least nine months before he copied these documents.\nWhen I discussed the chronology of the copied documents with\na former government official briefed on the investigation, he suggested\nthat Snowden’s purpose might have changed between 2012\nand 2013. When I asked him what might have induced the change,\nhe replied, “That is one of the unanswered questions.” That Snowden\nonly took these two whistle- blowing documents at the tail end of\nhis nine- month operation, and after he had contacted Poitras and\nGreen wald, suggests he might have had another motive prior to\ncontacting journalists. In light of this chronology, the investigation\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 140\n9/30/16 11:09 AM\nThe Crime Scene Investigation | 141\nhad to consider the possibility that his whistle- blowing was, partly if\nnot wholly, a cover for another enterprise.\nSnowden told journalists he had access to “millions of records\nthat [he] could walk out the door with at any time with no accountability,\nno oversight, no auditing, the government didn’t even know\nthey were gone.” However, he was not among the limited number\nof individuals at the center who had access to these documents.\nBoth the NSA’s and Booz Allen’s employment records showed that\nSnowden had not yet completed his requisite on- the- job training\nwhen he carried out the theft. Consequently, he had not yet been\nprovided with the passwords he needed to get the documents. Even\nif he had remained at the NSA long enough to finish his training,\nhe would only have been provided with the password to the particular\ncompartment relevant to his work, not to all compartments. The\ntight control over these passwords was, according to a former top\nNSA official, a critical part of the NSA’s security framework. He told\nme that Snowden, at least during the period of the thefts in April\nand May 2013, had no more legitimate access to the compartments\nthan the cleaning personnel. Somehow, though, Snowden converted\nhis proximity to access.\nIf a hundred top- quality diamonds were stolen from locked vaults\nat Tiffany by a recently hired trainee who, it turned out, did not have\nthe combination to open these vaults, the police would be expected to\nconsider that the trainee might have had help from a current or former\ninsider at the company who knew the combinations. Snowden,\nwho had accomplished a similarly inexplicable feat, said in his video\nconfession that he was solely responsible. However, it is perfectly\nlogical to assume, given the circumstances, that he might have had\nhelp, unwitting or witting.\nThe FBI could assume either that the NSA’s security regime was\nso badly flawed that Snowden could trick his fellow workers into\nproviding him with access or that there was another individual at\nthe center who might have assisted or directed Snowden. When the\ninvestigation came to this fork in the road in the summer of 2013,\naccording to a source on the House Intelligence Committee, it chose\nthe former route.\nFinally, there was the question of whether Snowden had gone to\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 141\n9/30/16 11:09 AM\n142 | how america lost its secrets\nRussia by design or by accident. Whenever an intelligence worker\nsteals sensitive compartmented information of interest to a foreign\nadversary and then defects to that adversary, it raises at least the\nspecter of state- sponsored espionage. It is a commonly accepted presumption\nin counterintelligence that a spy, fearing arrest, flees to\na country that has some reason to offer him protection. When the\nBritish spies Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, and Kim Philby fled to\nMoscow during the Cold War, the presumption was that they had a\nprior intelligence connection with Russia. Philby confirmed that in\nhis 1968 memoir, My Silent War. So in the case of Snowden, counterintelligence\nhad to consider the possibility that his theft of state\nsecrets and his arrival in Moscow might not be totally coincidental.\nSnowden blamed high officials in the U.S. government who purposely\n“trapped him” in Russia. He told the editor of The Nation,\n“I’m in exile. My government revoked my passport intentionally to\nleave me exiled” and “chose to keep me in Russia.” He repeated that\nassertion over a dozen times, but as we’ve seen, it had no basis in\nfact. Whenever criminal charges are lodged against a U.S. citizen by\nthe Department of Justice, the State Department, in accordance with\nthe U.S. code of justice, marks in the electronic passport validation\nadvisory system that that person’s passport is valid only for return\nto the United States. After criminal charges were publicly filed\nagainst Snowden on June 21, it advised foreign governments that\nbecause Snowden was wanted on felony charges, he “should not be\nallowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is\nnecessary to return him to the United States.” Rather than “exiling”\nSnowden, the government acted to facilitate his return home. With\nhis passport, he could have flown home from either Hong Kong or\nMoscow, where he, like any other person accused of a felony, would\nface the charges against him. Snowden’s unfounded claims suggested\nto investigators that he had something to hide about his arrival in\nRussia.\nThe counterintelligence investigation had access to State Department\nrecords showing that its representatives in Hong Kong had\ninformed authorities there on June 16 that there were criminal\ncharges against Snowden. Only a typographical error in spelling out\nSnowden’s middle name— James instead of Joseph— in the criminal\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 142\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Crime Scene Investigation | 143\ncharges prevented the Hong Kong police from immediately ordering\nhis detention. His Hong Kong lawyers were certainly advised of\nthese pending charges no later than June 21, when they were published\non the front page of the South China Morning Post in Hong\nKong. Presumably, Snowden knew that actions by the U.S. government\nwere already in progress and that one of these actions would\ninclude restricting his passport. One of his lawyers, Jonathan Man,\neven accompanied Snowden to the airport out of his concern that he\nwould not be allowed by Hong Kong authorities to go through passport\ncontrol. Ordinarily, Hong Kong passport control scans passports\nwhen tourists exit but does not check them against a computerized\ndatabase.\nIn any case, when Snowden arrived in Russia on June 23, any\nfuture international travel decisions for him would be up to the government\nof Russia, not that of the United States. It could have sent\nhim back to Hong Kong, as is normally done when someone arrives\nwithout a proper visa, or to the United States. The only government\nwith the actual means to “trap” him in Russia was the Russian\ngovernment.\nSenior intelligence officials also knew that the U.S. government,\nrather than conspiring to keep Snowden in Moscow, had met nearly\nevery day while he was in Hong Kong with Lisa Monaco, President\nObama’s homeland security adviser, in the White House Situation\nRoom to find a way to prevent Snowden and his cache of secrets\nfrom falling into Russian hands. Robert S. Mueller III, then the FBI\ndirector, reportedly even directly appealed to the FSB head, Alexander\nBortnikov, to return Snowden to the United States.\nU.S. intelligence also knew that it was no accident that Snowden\nwound up in the hands of Russia. He had been in contact with Russian\nofficials in Hong Kong. It will be recalled that Putin admitted to\nthis liaison on September 3, in a press briefing on state- owned Channel\nOne television; he also divulged that he had advance knowledge\nof Snowden’s plan.\n“I will tell you something I have never said before,” Putin said.\nSnowden “first went to Hong Kong and got in touch with our diplomatic\nrepresentatives.” Putin was told then that an American “agent\nof special services” was seeking to come to Russia. Putin added that\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 143\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n144 | how america lost its secrets\nhe declared that this agent would be “welcome, provided, however,\nthat he stops any kind of activity that could damage Russian- US\nrelations.”\nEven before that public confirmation of the Russian role in Hong\nKong, the White House was well aware of it. On June 23, the Democratic\nsenator Charles Schumer of New York correctly said, based\non a White House briefing, that “Vladimir Putin had personally\napproved Snowden’s flight” to Moscow. The NSA had the means to\nmonitor Russian communication between Moscow and Hong Kong.\nThe NSA also reportedly intercepted contacts between these Russian\nofficials and Russian representatives of Aeroflot, the Russian stateowned\nairline that had flights between Hong Kong and Moscow.\nAeroflot (like most other international carriers) ordinarily requires\ninternational passengers to have both a valid passport and, if necessary,\na visa to the country of their destination. Those rules had to\nbe waived for Snowden’s exfiltration from Hong Kong. Snowden’s\ndefection to Moscow was not a haphazard result of unexpected circumstances.\nRussia obviously knew he was coming. This raised new\nquestions for the investigation. What led Snowden to defect to Russia?\nWas his arrival in Moscow planned by Russian intelligence in\nadvance of his going public in Hong Kong? Was any other party,\nsuch as China, privy to the plan? Was there a quid pro quo?\nPutin’s authorization could certainly account for Aeroflot’s waiving\nits usual passport and visa check to allow Snowden to board its\nplane, as well as the dispatch with which Russian officials whisked\nSnowden off the plane after it landed at the Moscow airport. It could\nalso account for Snowden’s vanishing from public view for the next\nthree weeks and the promulgation of the cover story that Snowden\nwas unwillingly trapped at the airport by the U.S. government. The\nreasons behind Putin’s move were less clear.\nBy September 2013, the investigation was looking into a veritable\nabyss. Snowden’s culpability was no longer an issue. What was\nlacking from Snowden’s video, or the two- hour film made by Laura\nPoitras, was any specific information on how many documents he\nhad copied, how he had obtained the passwords to the computers\non which they were stored, the period of time involved in the theft,\nor how he had breached all the security measures of the NSA in\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 144\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Crime Scene Investigation | 145\nHawaii. Nor would that data be forthcoming from Snowden, who\nmay be the only witness to the crime. By June 23, he was in a safe\nhaven in Moscow. Even though the grand jury case against Snowden\nwas cut and dry, it was also irrelevant because the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty with Russia.\nThe purpose of the intelligence investigation went far beyond\ndetermining Snowden’s guilt or innocence, however. Its job was to\nfind out how such a massive theft of documents could occur, how the\nperpetrator escaped, and, perhaps most urgent, who had obtained the\nunaccounted- for stolen documents from Snowden.\nIn his interviews with journalists in Moscow, Snowden studiously\navoided describing the means by which he breached the security\naperture of America’s most secret intelligence service. He only told\nthe journalists who came to Moscow to interview him, with a bit of\npseudo- modesty, that he was not “an angel” who descended from\nheaven to carry out the theft. But the question of how Snowden\nstole these documents may be the most important part of the story.\nThe NSA, after all, furnishes communications intelligence to the\npresident, his national security advisers, and the Department of\nDefense, intelligence that is supposedly derived from secret sources\nin adversary nations. If these adversary nations learn about the\nNSA’s sources, then the information, if not worthless, cannot be\nfully trusted. The most basic responsibility of the NSA is to protect\nits sources. Yet Snowden walked away with long lists of them.\nIn doing so, he amply demonstrated that a single civilian employee\nworking for an outside contractor, even one not having the necessary\npasswords and other access privileges, could steal documents\nthat betrayed these vital sources. He also demonstrated that such a\nmassive theft could go undetected for at least two weeks.\nIf Snowden managed this feat on his own, as he claims in his\nHong Kong video, it suggests that any other civilian employee with\na perceived grievance against NSA practices or American foreign\npolicy could also walk away with some of the most precious secrets\nheld by U.S. intelligence. Such vulnerability extends to tens of thousands\nof civilian contract employees in positions similar to the one\nheld by Snowden. The lone disgruntled employee explanation is\ntherefore hardly reassuring. If true, it calls into question the entire\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 145\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n146 | how america lost its secrets\nmultibillion- dollar enterprise of outsourcing the management of the\nNSA’s computer networks and other technical work to outside contractors.\nIt also casts doubts on the post- 9/11 decision by the intelligence\ncommunity to strip away much of the NSA’s “stovepiping”\nthat previously insulated its most sensitive computers. Without\nsuch stovepiping, any rogue civilian employee could bring down the\nentire edifice of shared intelligence.\nA finding that Snowden had acted in concert with others in breaching\ncompartments at the NSA would hardly be any more reassuring.\nSuch collaboration among intelligence workers would reflect gravely\non the mind- set of the NSA. Snowden described an atmosphere in\nwhich intelligence workers exchanged lewd photographs of foreign\nsuspects. Some NSA employees met to protest the NSA policies. Did\nthis violation of the NSA’s rules also involve abetting the theft of\ndocuments? If so, the NSA would have to evaluate further vulnerabilities\nthat might arise when it entrusts its secrets to technicians\nwho do not share its values. A collaborative breach would signal an\nimmense failure of the present concept of the counterintelligence\nregime in the NSA.\nFrom what I gathered from government officials who were familiar\nwith the investigation, there was a concern that answering the\n“how” question would rouse serious doubts about the very ability\nof the NSA to carry out its core mission of protecting the government’s\nintelligence secrets. However it was organized, it was clear\nthat Snowden had played a major role in what amounted to a brilliant\nintelligence coup.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 146\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nc h a p t e r 15\nDid Snowden Act Alone?\nWhen you look at the totality of Snowden’s actions certainly one\nhypothesis that jumps out at you, that seems to explain his ability\nto do all these things, is that he had help and had help from\nsomebody who was very competent in these matters.\n— general michael hayden, former director, NSA and CIA\nA\nwhistle- blower enters the enterprise of stealing state\nsecrets for reasons of conscience, but so do many spies. Such\nconscience- driven spies are called, in CIA parlance, “ideological\nagents.” For instance, the British diplomat Donald Maclean, one\nof the most important Russian spies in the Cold War, was an ideological\nrecruit. He stole immensely valuable U.S. nuclear secrets\nfor the Russian intelligence service without receiving any monetary\ncompensation.\nThe acceptance of money is not necessarily a meaningful distinction\nwhen it comes to espionage. To be sure, many spies get\npaid, but some whistle- blowers also receive a rich bounty for their\nwork. Indeed, under federal laws, whistle- blowers can qualify for\nmultimillion- dollar bounties for exposing financial malfeasance. The\nwhistle- blower Bradley Birkenfeld, for example, after he himself\nwas paroled from prison in 2012, received an award of $104 million\nfor providing data that exposed illicit tax sheltering at the Swiss UBS\nbank. Assange also offered political whistle- blowers six- figure cash\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 147\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n148 | how america lost its secrets\nbounties from money raised on the Internet. In 2015, for instance,\nWikiLeaks offered $100,000 bounties to any whistle- blowers who\nprovided the site with secret documents exposing details of the\nTrans- Pacific Trade Agreement.\nNor is acting alone necessarily a line that divides whistle- blowers\nfrom spies. In many cases, whistle- blowers have accomplices who\nhelp them carry out their mission. For example, in 1969, the celebrated\nwhistle- blower Daniel Ellsberg, a military analyst at the\nRand Corporation, had an accomplice, Anthony Russo, who had also\nworked at Rand. (Both were indicted by the government.) Acting in\nconcert, they copied secret documents that became known famously\nas the Pentagon Papers.\nWhistle- blowers can also, like conventional spies, enter into elaborate\nconspiracies to carry out an operation. On the night of March 8,\n1971, eight whistle- blowers working together with burglary tools\nbroke into the FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, and stole almost all\nthe FBI files there. The conspirators escaped and kept their identities\nsecret for over forty- two years.\nSelf- definitions also do not necessarily produce a distinction\nbetween whistle- blowers and conventional spies. Consider Philip\nAgee, who left the CIA in 1969 for what he described as “reasons\nof conscience.” Specifically, he said he objected to the CIA’s covert\nsupport of Latin American dictators. After contacting the Soviet\nembassy in Mexico City, he defected to Cuba, where he leaked information\nthat exposed CIA operations. Although Agee insisted he was\na whistle- blower, and he adamantly denied offering any secrets to the\nSoviet Union, the KGB viewed him as a conventional spy. According\nto Oleg Kalugin, the top Soviet counterintelligence officer in the\nKGB in Moscow, who defected to the United States, Agee offered\nCIA secrets first to the KGB residency in Mexico City in 1973 and\nthen to the Cuban intelligence service. Agee provided the KGB with\na “treasure trove” of U.S. secrets, Kalugin revealed. “I then sat in\nmy office in Moscow reading the growing list of revelations coming\nfrom Agee.” Despite this disparity, Agee still defined himself to the\npublic as a whistle- blower because he also had exposed CIA operations\nto the public.\nThe Snowden case blurs the demarcation line even further. Unlike\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 148\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nDid Snowden Act Alone? | 149\nother whistle- blowers who uncovered what they considered government\nmalfeasance by virtue of their jobs, Snowden, by his own\nadmission, took a new job in 2013 specifically to get access to the SCI\nfiles concerning NSA sources that he stole from the Threat Operations\nCenter. Switching jobs in order to widen one’s access to state\nsecrets is an activity usually associated with penetration agents, not\nwhistle- blowers. While the technical distinction between a whistleblower\nand a spy may still serve the media in the case of Snowden,\nit does not help in solving the counterintelligence conundrum. A\ncomplex theft of state secrets had been successfully carried out in\na supposedly secure site. The only known witness, Snowden, had\nescaped to Russia, where he could be of no help in reconstructing the\ncrime for American intelligence agencies. The stolen data was kept\nin the equivalent of sealed “vaults”— actually computer drives that\nwere not connected to the NSA network. If ever there was a lockedroom\nmystery, this was it.\nAccording to the FBI investigation, Snowden pierced these barriers\nby using passwords that belonged to other people and using credentials\nthat allowed him to masquerade as a system administrator.\nIt was a feat that must have required meticulous planning.\nTo address such a mystery, a counterintelligence investigation\nstarts with a tabula rasa, stripping away all the previous assumptions,\nincluding that Snowden was the lone perpetrator. It builds\nalternative scenarios to test against the known facts. To be sure, scenario\nbuilding differs from that of a conventional forensic investigation\naimed at finding pieces of evidence that can be used to persuade\na jury in a courtroom. Unlike a judicial investigation concerned with\nguilt and innocence, scenario building looks to develop a story that\nis, concurrently, intrinsically consistent and humanly plausible, and\nin the process it also identifies and explores the possible holes in the\ncase.\n“Scenarios deal with two worlds: the world of facts and the world\nof perceptions. They explore for facts but they aim at perceptions\ninside the heads of decision makers. Their purpose is to gather and\ntransform information of strategic significance into fresh perceptions,”\nwrote Pierre Wack in the Harvard Business Review in 1985.\nSuch scenarios must aim at constituting a limited set of mutually\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 149\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n150 | how america lost its secrets\nexclusive alternatives. The point is to assure that any alternative that\nfits the relevant facts, no matter how implausible it may initially\nseem to be, is not neglected.\nOne of the most vexing problems that had to be explained by these\nscenarios is how Snowden got the passwords to up to twenty- four of\nthese vaults. He could not have obtained these passwords during his\nprevious employment at Dell, because Dell technicians did not have\naccess to the Level 3 documents stored in these compartments. Nor,\nas noted earlier, was he given access to them when he transferred to\nBooz Allen, because he had not completed the requisite training.\nSnowden had also, it will be recalled, relinquished his privileges as\na system administrator when he transferred to Booz Allen, so he did\nnot have the privilege to override password protection. In short, his\nnew position as an infrastructure analyst did not give him the ability\nto enter compartments that he had not yet been read into.\nAs I’ve said, there are two possible ways he could have gotten\nthese passwords: either he had assistance from a party who had\naccess to them, or he found flaws in the NSA’s security procedures\nthat left the supposedly closed vaults effectively unlocked.\nThe Unwitting Accomplice Possibility\nIt is possible that if Snowden received assistance, it was entirely\nunwitting. He might have obtained some passwords through deception,\nsuch as tricking co- workers into typing their passwords into\na device that captured them. As the NSA informed Congress in\n2014, three of his fellow workers told the FBI that Snowden might\nhave deceived them to gain access to their passwords. He could have\nsimply asked other analysts at the center who had been read into\ncompartments for their passwords. Such an approach would be\nextremely risky for the analyst, who could lose his job and security\nclearance by cooperating. It could also be risky for Snowden because\nany analyst he approached was supposed to report any request for\na password to a security officer. Making such requests even more\nsuspicious, Snowden had been working at the Threat Operations\nCenter for just a few weeks as a trainee and was not well known to\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 150\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nDid Snowden Act Alone? | 151\nother analysts there. “It is inconceivable to me that his co- workers\nwould divulge their passwords to him,” a former Booz Allen executive,\nwho had also worked at the Defense Intelligence Agency, told\nme. “If he was a system administrator, he might trick a threat analyst\ninto entering his password into his computer under the pretext\nthat he needed it to deal with an urgent hardware issue.” But,\nit will be recalled, Snowden was not a system administrator at the\ncenter. Snowden therefore “had no plausible reason for requesting\npasswords to compartments he had not been read into,” the former\nexecutive said. He said that NSA executives might have been read\ninto all twenty- four of the compartments, but he deemed it inconceivable\nthey would illicitly share their passwords with Snowden. I\nasked him what the chance was of his voluntarily obtaining some\ntwenty- four passwords from co- workers in five weeks. “In my opinion,\nnear zero,” he said.\nIt is possible of course that Snowden could have simply observed\nothers typing in their passwords, one by one, but that would take\ntime and possibly attract attention. I asked the former Booz Allen\ncontractor whether it was possible that Snowden could have used a\ndevice for intercepting another computer’s electronic signals, called\nby hackers a “key logger.” Such a device, which is obtainable over\nthe Internet, could be used to steal the passwords of the analysts\nwho had been read into the compartments. My source said that\nwhile it was possible that Snowden smuggled in a key logger in his\nbackpack, it could not be operated unless it was hardwired to a computer\ninside the center, because, like those at all other NSA facilities,\nthe computers had been insulated to block any form of wireless\ntransmission. This precaution was taken to guard against an EMP, or\nelectromagnetic pulse, attack by an enemy. The only way Snowden\ncould intercept keystrokes was to attach a cable from his key logger\nto each of his fellow workers’ computers. In this scenario, he would\nhave had to surreptitiously build his own wired network connecting\nhis hidden key logger to twenty- four separate computers. Moreover,\nhe would have to do this wiring in an open- plan office where\nhe could not count on these additional wires, even if rigged one by\none, not being noticed by either other analysts in the room or the\n“geek squad” of system administrators who regularly checked con-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 151\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n152 | how america lost its secrets\nnections. Making the task even more risky, according to my Booz\nAllen source, there were closed- circuit cameras. The only way he\ncould mitigate the risk of detection was by having someone help\nhim build this network.\nEven if Snowden had managed to obtain all the necessary passwords\nfrom colleagues, he would have had to transfer the files to an\nexternal storage device. This was not a matter of simply attaching\na thumb drive or other external device to a port, because, unlike in\nmovies such as Mission: Impossible, the ports on the computers at\nthe NSA were ordinarily sealed shut. This measure was taken specifically\nto prevent any unauthorized downloading by NSA workers.\nThe only people at the center who had the authorization, and the\nmeans, to open these ports and transfer data were system administrators,\naccording to the former Booz Allen executive. System\nadministrators needed to have this privilege to deal with glitches\nin the computers. Snowden was no longer a system administrator\nand had no such privileges. So again, he would have needed help.\nHe would have needed to either borrow a system administrator’s\ncredential or forge his own.\nThe credential he would need is called a public key infrastructure,\nor PKI, card with its authentication code embedded in a magnetic\nstrip. When I asked the former Booz Allen executive if Snowden\npossessed the skill set to forge such a card, he said that he strongly\ndoubted any NSA employee would be capable of such a forgery\nwithout special equipment. Just asking such a favor could “set off\nalarms,” my source said.\nThe unwitting accomplice scenario had another stumbling block:\ntime. We know from Poitras that Snowden told her in early April\n2013 that he planned to deliver documents to her in six to eight\nweeks (which he in fact did). But he had not yet started working for\nBooz Allen at the center until that same month. It does not seem\nplausible that in making such a commitment he was merely counting\non his ingenuity in the face of strangers to fulfill it. The only way\nhe could have known for certain that he would be able to borrow a\nPKI card and obtain the passwords, whether by trickery, by observation,\nor by a key router, before he had begun working at the center\nwas that he already knew someone there who would help him.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 152\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Witting Accomplice Possibility\nDid Snowden Act Alone? | 153\nThe witting accomplice scenario better fits with the principle in logic\ncalled Occam’s razor, which suggests that when one is choosing\nbetween alternative explanations, the one that requires the fewest\nassumptions should be given priority. It would be relatively easy\nto gain access to passwords if Snowden had the cooperation of an\ninsider at the center who had been read into the compartments or,\neven better, if he had the cooperation of a system administrator with\nthe necessary PKI cards and shell keys to bypass the password protection.\nSuch an accomplice could also help explain how Snowden\nwas able to get the job at the center in the first place, how he knew\nin advance that he could find there the “lists” of the NSA sources in\nforeign countries, and how he knew that there were security traps at\nthe center. Such a witting accomplice might even have prepared in\nadvance the “spiders” that Snowden used to index the files.\nThe witting accomplice scenario of course requires an unsettling\nexpansion of the plot. It means Snowden collaborated with one or\nmore insiders at the center to steal secret documents. It is not difficult\nto imagine, in light of the lax background checks for outside\ncontractors servicing the NSA, that there were others in the “geek\nsquad” who shared Snowden’s antipathy to NSA surveillance. Certainly,\nwe know that Snowden found other NSA workers who were\nwilling to attend his anti- surveillance CryptoParty in December\n2012. Some might be willing to offer Snowden help if he was willing\nto go public. Indeed, if the geek culture produced one Snowden, why\nwouldn’t it produce others? If such an accomplice lacked Snowden’s\nwillingness to flee to another country, he might have limited his participation\nto supplying technical assistance. For his part, Snowden\nmight have agreed to divert suspicion from his accomplice by taking\nsole responsibility for the crime when he went public.\nAll of this is theoretically possible, but no witting accomplice was\never identified. The FBI, which was in charge of the domestic part of\nthe investigation of the Snowden case, questioned all of Snowden’s\nco- workers at the center over the course of six months and failed\nto find anyone who knowingly helped Snowden. If the accomplice\nwas an idealistic amateur, it is likely the FBI would have found him.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 153\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n154 | how america lost its secrets\nThree co- workers did admit to the FBI, as noted earlier, that they\nmight have inadvertently given Snowden their passwords, but these\nthree slips would not account for Snowden’s breach of all the other\ncompartments. Of course, there might have also been less forthcoming\nco- workers who hid their slips in divulging their passwords to\nSnowden.\nThis raises the more sinister possibility that the accomplice\nwas not an amateur co- worker but a spy who was already in place\nwhen Snowden arrived. Such a penetration agent could have been\nrecruited by an adversary intelligence service before Snowden came\non the scene. After Snowden expressed a desire to expose the NSA’s\ndomestic surveillance, it could then have used him as an “umbrella”\nto hide its own activities. Finding such a means to protect a source\nwhile exploiting his or her information is not uncommon in espionage\noperations, and because Snowden was willing to flee America\nand go public, he could serve as a near- perfect umbrella. “Snowden\nmay have carried out of the NSA many more documents than he\nknew about,” Tyler Drumheller, the former CIA station chief, said. It\ncould also account for the disparity between the claims of Snowden\nand the NSA damage assessment as to the number of documents\nthat were compromised.\nAs far- fetched as this scenario may seem, less than three years\nbefore the Snowden breach the NSA had received a warning from\na CIA mole (to be discussed in greater detail later) that the Russian\nintelligence service might have recruited a KGB mole at the Fort\nMeade headquarters of the NSA. No mole was found in 2010, and\nif one existed, it could not have been Snowden, who was working\nfor the NSA in Japan in 2010. Such a putative mole could conceivably\nhave acquired enough information to later facilitate Snowden’s\noperation.\nAs Snowden acknowledges, he was not a happy worker at the\nNSA. He complained in his posts over the Internet between 2010\nand 2013 about superiors and what he considered NSA abuses to\nco- workers. If someone assumed the guise of a reluctant whistleblower,\nhe would have little difficulty in approaching Snowden.\nSnowden might not even know his true affiliation beyond that he\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 154\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nDid Snowden Act Alone? | 155\nshared Snowden’s anti- surveillance views. If Snowden then voiced\nan interest in exposing the NSA’s secrets, this person could supply\nhim with the necessary guidance, steering a still- unsuspecting\nSnowden first to the Booz Allen position and afterward to his associates\nin Hong Kong. By taking sole credit for the coup in the video\nthat he made with Poitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong, he acted, as\nhe told Greenwald, to divert suspicion from anyone else. This move\ncould also give any collaborator he might have had in Hawaii time\nto cover his or her tracks.\nThe astronomer Carl Sagan famously said in regard to searching\nthe universe for signals from other civilizations that the “absence\nof evidence is not evidence of absence.” That injunction also applies\nto the spooky universe of espionage. The fact that a mole hunt fails\nto find a hidden collaborator at the NSA does not necessarily mean\nsuch a mole does not exist. Historically, we have many notable cases\nin which Russian moles eluded long, intensive investigations. Robert\nHanssen penetrated the FBI for over twenty years for the KGB\nwithout being caught. Similarly, Aldrich Ames acted as a KGB mole\nin the CIA for more than ten years and passed all the CIA’s sophisticated\nlie detector tests. Both Hanssen and Ames eluded intensive FBI\nand CIA investigations that lasted over a decade. According to Victor\nCherkashin, their KGB case officer, whom I interviewed in Moscow\nin 2015, the KGB was able to hide their existence from investigators\nfor such a long period partly because of the widespread belief in U.S.\nintelligence that moles were fictional creatures that sprang from the\n“paranoid mind” of James Jesus Angleton. When I then cited the\nsignature line from the movie The Usual Suspects, “The greatest\ntrick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist,”\nCherkashin thinly smiled and said, “CIA denial [of moles] certainly\nhelped.”\nIn view of such past successes of the Russian intelligence services,\nit cannot be precluded that there was another person in the NSA\nworking with the enthusiastic Snowden as cover to prevent any light\nfrom falling on his own surreptitious spying. While it may seem\nextremely unlikely that Snowden had such assistance, the alternative\nscenario, that Snowden broke into the sealed compartments and\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 155\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n156 | how america lost its secrets\nmade off with the documents without any assistance, seems equally\nunlikely.\nEven if Snowden had been, as he claims, a pure idealist seeking\nto right a perceived wrong, it does not exclude the possibility\nof his becoming entangled in the plots of others. Intelligence services\nmake it their business to bring about such witting or unwitting\nentanglements.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 156\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nc h a p t e r 16\nThe Question of When\nThe NSA was actually concerned back in the time of the cryptowars\nwith improving American security. Nowadays, we see that\ntheir priority is weakening our security.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2015\nIn his 1974 novel, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, John Le Carré\nhelped establish the concept in the public imagination of a mole\nburrowing into a rival intelligence service. Le Carré’s now-classic\nmole, code- named Gerald by the KGB, managed in the novel to gain\naccess to the inner sanctum of the British intelligence service MI6.\nAided and guided by his controllers in Moscow, he systematically\nstole British intelligence secrets. As Le Carré wove the plot, the brilliantly\norchestrated operation involved spotting, compromising, and\nrecruiting others to gradually advance Gerald the mole to a position\nof power. Such well- organized penetrations are not limited to fiction.\nThe career of the KGB mole Heinz Felfe, who was advanced through\nthe ranks of West German intelligence by an elaborate series of sacrifices\nby his controllers in Moscow until he actually headed West\nGerman counterintelligence in 1961, could have served as the nonfiction\ninspiration for Le Carré’s 1963 novel, The Spy Who Came\nin from the Cold. As U.S. intelligence only found out after the Cold\nWar ended, the KGB also had the ability to sustain moles for decades.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 157\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n158 | how america lost its secrets\nThe CIA also had its share of long- term successes, such as Alexander\nPoteyev, who fed the CIA secrets for over ten years while\nburrowing into Russian intelligence. In the choreography of these\noperations, as in Le Carré’s fiction, rival intelligence services ensnared\nand sacrificed recruits, as if playing a chess game, to advance their\nmoles. Despite notable successes such as Felfe and Poteyev, a great\nnumber of these elaborate conspiracies fail to insinuate a mole into\ntheir adversaries’ confidence. Intelligence services therefore also\ntake advantage of a more prosaic source: the self- generated spy, or,\nas they are called in the trade, a “walk- in.”\nAlthough they are largely unsung in novels, these walk- ins are an\nimportant part of espionage. A counterespionage review done for the\nPresidential Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) in 1990\nfound that most U.S. spies in the Cold War had taken documents on\ntheir own volition and only afterward offered them to an adversary\nservice. Self- generated spies have diverse motives. Some intelligence\nworkers steal secrets for financial gain. Others take them to further\nan ideological interest. As opportunistic enterprises, intelligence services\ndo not turn walk- ins away if they have valuable intelligence.\nIndeed, some of the most successful moles were not recruited, or even\ncontrolled, by spy agencies. They were self- generated penetrations,\nor “espionage sources,” as the KGB preferred to call them, who first\nstole secrets and later voluntarily delivered them to an adversary.\nHanssen, who successfully penetrated the FBI for the Russian\nintelligence services from 1979 to 2001, according to the assessment\nof a 2002 presidential commission, had caused “the worst intelligence\ndisaster in US history.” Eleven years later, George Ellard, a\nformer NSA inspector general who had been a member of that commission,\ncompared Hanssen with Snowden “in that they both used\nvery well- honed IT abilities to steal and disclose classified information\nvital to our national security.”\nIt is also possible to exploit a walk- in even after he has left his\nservice. For example, the KGB major Anatoliy Golitsyn was an ideological\nself- generated spy who walked into the U.S. embassy in Helsinki\non December 15, 1961. He asked to see the CIA officer on duty\nand announced to him that he had collected a trove of KGB secrets,\nincluding information that could identify its key spies in the West.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 158\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Question of When | 159\nHe offered to defect to the United States. The CIA accepted his offer,\nand through this archive of secrets he had previously compiled, he\nbecame one of the CIA’s most productive sources in the Cold War.\nThe job of an intelligence service is to take advantage of whatever\nopportunities come its way in the form of self- generated spies. If\na Russian walk- in had not yet burned his bridges to his own service,\nU.S. intelligence officers were under instructions to attempt to\npersuade the walk- in to return to his post in Russia and serve as a\n“defector- in- place,” or mole. “While defectors can and do provide\ncritical information,” a CIA memorandum on walk- ins during the\nCold War noted, “there are very few cases in which the same individual\nmay not have been of greater value if he had returned to his\npost.” Of course, if a walk- in believed he was already compromised,\nas Golitsyn did, a decision would have to be made whether the value\nof his intelligence merited exfiltrating him to the United States.\nThis required evaluating the bona fides of the walk- in. Not all\nwalk- ins are accepted as defectors. Some walk- ins are deemed “dangles,”\nor agents dispatched by the KGB to test and confuse the CIA.\nOthers are rejected as political liabilities, as happened to Wang Lijun,\na well- connected police chief in China. In February 2012, Wang\nwalked into the U.S. consulate in Chengdu asking for asylum. The\nState Department decided against it. After Wang left U.S. protection,\nhe was arrested for corruption and received a fifteen- year prison\nsentence. Such decisions about walk- ins are not made without due\nconsideration, often at the highest level of a government, because\nexfiltrating a defector can result in diplomatic ruptures and political\nembarrassments.\nConversely, it raises espionage concerns when an adversary government\nauthorizes the exfiltration of a rogue employee of an intelligence\nservice. At minimum, it suggests that a rival government\nplaced value on what the defector could provide it. The Snowden\ncase is no exception. Whatever Snowden’s prior relations might have\nbeen with Russia, it can be assumed that after he fled to Moscow,\nin light of the intelligence value of the stolen documents, he would\nwind up in the hands of the Russian security services. That assumption\nwas reinforced by subsequent countermeasures that were\nimplemented by adversaries moved to block secret sources of NSA\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 159\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n160 | how america lost its secrets\nsurveillance, as the CIA deputy director later revealed. Such moves\ncould indicate that at least part of the U.S. communications intelligence\nthat Snowden had stolen was in enemy hands. The CIA and\nNSA’s monitoring of these countermeasures was itself extremely\ndelicate, because revealing what they learned about Russian and\nChinese countermeasures risked compromising even more U.S.\ncommunications sources than had Snowden.\nGeneral Alexander said in his interview with The Australian\nFinancial Review, “We absolutely need to know what Russia’s\ninvolvement is with Snowden.” He further said, “I think Snowden\nis now being manipulated by Russian intelligence. I just don’t know\nwhen that exactly started.” At what point did Snowden first come in\ncontact with the Russians? The counterintelligence issue was not if\nthis U.S. intelligence defector in Moscow was under Russian control\nbut when he came under it.\nThere were three possible time periods when Snowden might\nhave been brought under control by the Russian intelligence service:\nwhile he was still working for the NSA; after he arrived in Hong\nKong on May 20, 2013; or after he arrived in Russia on June 23,\n2013.\nThe NSA Scenario\nThe first scenario could stretch as far back as when Snowden was\nforced out of the CIA in 2009. It will be recalled that the CIA had\nplanned to launch a security investigation of Snowden, but it was\naborted when he resigned. He had also incurred large losses speculating\nin the financial markets in Geneva, which is the kind of activity\nthat had in the past attracted the interest of foreign intelligence\nservices. So it has to be considered in this scenario that Snowden had\nbeen recruited by the Russians after he left the CIA and directed to\ntake jobs at civilian contractors servicing the NSA.\nSuch “career management,” as it is called by the CIA, could\nexplain why Snowden had switched jobs in March 2013 to Booz\nAllen Hamilton, which, unlike his previous employer, Dell, allowed\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 160\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Question of When | 161\nhim to gain proximity to the super-secret lists of the telecommunications\nsystems that the NSA had penetrated in Russia and China.\nThis could account for how he managed to acquire the necessary\npasswords to accrue privileged information. It could also account for\nwhy the documents he copied that pertained to NSA operations in\nRussia were not among those he gave to Poitras, Greenwald, and\nother journalists. Because Russia has had an active intelligencesharing\ntreaty with China since 1996, it could further explain why\nhis first stop was Hong Kong, a part of China. It was a safe venue for\ndebriefing Snowden, as well as establishing his credentials among\njournalists as a whistle- blower, before a decision was made to allow\nhim to proceed to Russia.\nThe nearly fatal problem with this early recruitment scenario is\nSnowden’s contacts with journalists. Snowden, it will be recalled,\nhad contacted Greenwald in December 2012. Greenwald was a highprofile\nblogger in Brazil who did not use encryption or any security\nsafeguards. Next, he contacted Poitras in January 2013 in Berlin;\nshe was a magnet for NSA dissidents. Both of these contacts put\nSnowden’s clandestine downloading at grave risk. As known opponents\nof U.S. intelligence agencies, these journalists might be, as they\nthemselves suspected they were, under surveillance by American,\nBritish, Brazilian, or German intelligence services. Greenwald and\nPoitras might also tell others who were either under surveillance or\ninformers. So no matter what precautions Snowden took, his secret\nenterprise, or just the fact he was in contact with anti- government\nactivists, might be detected. At minimum, he could lose his access to\nsecrets and be of no further use as a source at the NSA. He could also\nbe interrogated and reveal the way he was brought under control. If\nSnowden had actually been under the control of the Russian intelligence\nservice, the last thing it would allow was for him to take such\na risk— or even to contact a single journalist. After all, the purpose\nof an espionage operation is to steal secrets without alerting anyone\nto the theft.\nA former CIA officer told me that while anything could “go haywire”\nin an intelligence operation, it would be “unthinkable” that\nthe Russian intelligence service would permit an undercover source\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 161\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n162 | how america lost its secrets\nit controlled in the NSA to expose himself by contacting journalists.\nSnowden’s continued interactions with Poitras and Greenwald make\nit implausible that he was under Russian control before he went to\nHong Kong.\nThe Hong Kong Scenario\nThe most compelling support for the scenario that Snowden was\nbrought under Russian control while he was in Hong Kong comes, it\nwill be recalled, from Vladimir Putin. His disclosure about the case\nleaves little doubt that Russian officials had engaged Snowden in\nHong Kong, that Putin had authorized his trip to Moscow, and that\nthe Russian government allowed him to fly to Moscow without a\nRussian visa. We know that Putin’s version is supported by U.S. surveillance\nof Snowden’s activities in Hong Kong. We also know that\nthe Russians went to some lengths not only to facilitate his trip to\nMoscow but to arrange to keep him in Russia. This supports the\npossibility that the Russian intelligence service managed to bring\nSnowden under its sway during his thirty- four days in Hong Kong.\nThe Russian intelligence service might even have been aware\nof Snowden and his anti- NSA activities before his arrival on May\n20. Snowden was anything but discreet in his contacts with strangers\nin the anti- surveillance movement, including such well- known\nactivists as Runa Sandvik (to whom he revealed his true name and\naddress via e- mail), Micah Lee, Jacob Appelbaum, Parker Higgins,\nand Laura Poitras. “It is not statistically improbable that members of\nthis circle were being watched by a hostile service,” a former NSA\ncounterintelligence officer told me in 2015. When I told him that\nPoitras and others in her circle had used PGP encryption, aliases,\nand Tor software in their exchanges with Snowden, he said, arching\nhis eyebrows, “That might work against amateurs, but it wouldn’t\nstop the Russians if they thought they might have a defector in the\nNSA.” He explained that both the NSA and hostile services have the\n“means” to bypass such safeguards.\nI asked what the Russian intelligence service would have done if\nit had indeed spotted Snowden in late 2012 or early 2013. “Maybe\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 162\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Question of When | 163\njust research him,” he replied. As we know now, he pointed out, Russia\nand China probably had access to the 127- page standard form in\nhis personnel file that he updated in 2011. They also had the capability\nto track his air travel to Hong Kong. “Could someone have\nsteered him to Hong Kong?” I asked. He answered, with a shrug,\n“That depends on whether Snowden had a confidante who could\nhave influenced him.”\nWhenever adversaries became aware of Snowden in this scenario,\nit was not until after he copied the NSA secrets and took them with\nhim to Hong Kong that Russian intelligence officers offered him a\ndeal. So from the Russian point of view, Snowden had already burned\nhis bridges. Because he had used other people’s passwords and access\nprivileges to get into computers that he was not authorized to use,\nillegally moved documents, and given a false reason for his medical\nleave, it was only a matter of time, as he told Greenwald in his\ninterview in Hong Kong, before NSA investigators would identify\nhim as a possible spy. He could be of no further use at the NSA to an\nadversary. His intelligence value now lay in the documents he had\ntaken with him or stored in the cloud as well as his ability to help\nclarify them in debriefing sessions. He could also inflict damage on\nthe morale and public standing of the NSA by denouncing its spying\nin the media.\nOnce Snowden was in Hong Kong, the Russians would have no\nreason to restrain him from holding a press event or releasing a\nvideo. In fact, the KGB had organized press conferences for all the\nprevious NSA defectors to Moscow. Hong Kong was a perfect venue\nfor a well- staged media event because all the major newspapers in\nthe world had bureaus there. Snowden’s disclosures about NSA spying\ncould serve to weaken the NSA’s relations with its allies.\nIt is also possible that Russian or Chinese intelligence did not\nbecome aware of Snowden until after he went public in June by\nhaving The Guardian release his video. The video would have convinced\nthe Russians or the Chinese of how dissatisfied Snowden was\nwith the NSA. Because dissatisfaction is one of the classic means of\nrecruitment in the intelligence business, he would certainly become\na prime target for recruitment after he went public.\nThe CIA also considered the possibility that Snowden might\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 163\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n164 | how america lost its secrets\nhave been reeled in unwittingly. Morell suggested in his book that\nSnowden might not himself have fully realized “when and how he\nwould be used.”\nIt can be safely assumed that the decision made by Putin’s intelligence\nservice to allow Snowden to travel to Russia proceeded from\nsomething other than softhearted sentiment about his welfare. After\nPutin learned that there was an American in Hong Kong from the\n“special services” seeking to come to Russia, he also learned from\nSnowden’s own disclosure on the video released that Snowden had\ntaken a large number of NSA documents to Hong Kong: indeed,\nsome were shown on the video. After that self- outing by Snowden,\nPutin had plenty of time to calculate the advantages and disadvantages\nof allowing him to come to Moscow.\nPutin could offer him not only freedom from arrest but also a\nplatform to express his views. The exploitation of an intelligence\ndefector, even after he yields his secrets, can be the final stage of\na successful intelligence operation. The CIA considered one of its\ngreatest coups of the Cold War its release of the espionage- acquired\nsecret speech of Nikita Khrushchev to the Communist Party of the\nSoviet Union in 1956 exposing the transgressions of the previous\nregime of Joseph Stalin. Making public these deeds was meant by\nthe CIA to sow discord both inside the Soviet Union and to disrupt\nits relations with its allies. General Alexander suggested that Putin\nmight similarly be “looking to capitalize on the fact that [Snowden’s]\nactions are enormously disruptive and damaging to US interests.”\nThis potential gain, if Alexander’s assessment is correct, provided\nPutin with an additional reason to have his representatives in Hong\nKong offer Snowden exfiltration.\nSnowden was in no position to refuse. After the release of the\nvideo, there was no going back to America without his facing a\ndetermined criminal prosecution. He would have known that in\nalmost every prior case intelligence workers who had intentionally\nreleased even a single classified document had gone to prison. As his\nInternet postings show, he had closely followed the ordeal of Bradley\nManning, whose trial was coming to its conclusion while Snowden\nwas in Hong Kong. Manning had been kept in solitary confinement\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 164\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Question of When | 165\nunder horrific conditions for over a year while awaiting his trial and\nwas facing a long prison sentence. There was no reason for Snowden\nto expect a better outcome for himself if he returned to the United\nStates or was arrested anywhere else that had an extradition treaty\nwith the United States. As the Russian officials in Hong Kong would\nhave informed him, Russia had no extradition treaty with the United\nStates. It was also one of the few places in the world that he could\nreach from Hong Kong without flying through airspace in which he\nmight be intercepted by a U.S. ally. Snowden was told he could take\nthe direct Aeroflot flight to Moscow without a valid passport or visa.\nThat Snowden’s alternative to going to Russia was going to prison\ngave the Russians considerable leverage in Hong Kong. The Russian\n“diplomats” could have used this leverage to extract a quid pro\nquo. The price of admission might have meant putting himself in the\nhands of Russian intelligence and telling it all he knew.\nThe Moscow Scenario\nThe final possibility is that Snowden did not come under Russian\ncontrol until after he arrived in Moscow. After assessing the negative\nattitude that Snowden expressed toward government authority\non the video that was released by The Guardian, the Russian “diplomats”\nin Hong Kong might have concluded that Snowden could bolt\nif too much pressure was exerted on him there. The Russians could\nafford to be patient. They knew that Interpol and the United States\nwould be pursuing Snowden throughout the world and that he had\nno valid travel documents and that his credit cards had been frozen.\nThey would likely know that Sarah Harrison had arranged his flight\nto Moscow on June 23. So they had no urgent need to apply pressure\non him before his plane landed in Russia.\nAfter the Russians took him in a “special operation” from the\nplane at the airport, he was informed by Russian authorities that\nhe would not be allowed to go to Cuba, Venezuela, Iceland, Ecuador,\nor any other country without the permission of Russian officials,\nwhich would not be immediately forthcoming. He was now at the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 165\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n166 | how america lost its secrets\nmercy of the Russian authorities. There was good reason for keeping\nhim in a virtual prison in Russia. “He can compromise thousands\nof intelligence and military officials,” Sergei Alexandrovich Markov,\nthe co- chairman of the National Strategic Council of Russia and an\nadviser to Putin, pointed out. “We can’t send him back just because\nAmerica demands it.”\nSo Snowden was consigned to the transit zone of the airport,\nwhich is a twilight zone neither inside nor outside Russia, a netherworld\nthat extends beyond the confines of the airport to include safe\nhouses and other facilities maintained by the FSB for the purposes\nof interrogation and security. Stranded at the Moscow airport, no\nmatter what he had believed earlier in Hong Kong, Snowden would\nquickly realize that he had only one viable option: seeking protection\nin Russia.\nEven though the FSB is known by U.S. intelligence to strictly\ncontrol the movements and contacts of former members of foreign\nintelligence services in Russia, Snowden might not have realized the\nfull extent of the FSB’s interest in him. He naively told The Washington\nPost in December 2013, in Moscow, “I am still working for\nthe NSA right now. They are the only ones who don’t realize it.”\nWhatever he might have been thinking, a former U.S. communications\nintelligence worker who stole American state secrets, such as\nSnowden, would be under the FSB’s scrutiny.\nAndrei Soldatov, the co- author of the 2010 book The New Nobility:\nThe Restoration of Russia’s Security State and the Enduring\nLegacy of the KGB, who was personally knowledgeable about\nFSB procedures, explained the FSB would monitor “every facet of\nSnowden’s communications, and his life.” General Oleg Kalugin,\nwho, as previously mentioned, defected from the KGB to the United\nStates in 1995, added that the FSB (following the standard operating\nprocedures of the KGB) would be “his hosts and they are taking care\nof him.” Kalugin further said in 2014, “Whatever he had access to in\nhis former days at NSA, I believe he shared all of it with the Russians,\nand they are very grateful.” This assessment was backed by Frants\nKlintsevich. As the first deputy chairman of the Kremlin’s defense\nand security committee at the time of Snowden’s defection, he was\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 166\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Question of When | 167\nin a position to know Snowden’s contribution. “Let’s be frank,” he\nsaid in a taped interview with NPR (in Russian), “Snowden did share\nintelligence. This is what security services do. If there’s a possibility\nto get information, they will get it.”\nEven without Klintsevich’s comments, top American intelligence\nofficers had little doubt that the Russian security services would do\ntheir job. Michael Hayden, for example, who in succession headed\nthree American intelligence services, was certainly in a position to\nappreciate the capabilities of the Russian and Chinese intelligence\nservices. He told me in 2014 that he saw no other possibility than\nthat Snowden would be induced to cooperate in this situation, saying,\n“I would lose all respect for the Russian and Chinese security\nservices if they haven’t fully exploited everything Snowden had to\ngive.” They certainly had that opportunity when Snowden spent\nalmost six weeks at Sheremetyevo International Airport. The FSB\ncontrolled his access to food, lodgings, the Internet, and whatever\nelse he needed to survive there. If he did not cooperate, the FSB\ncould also return him to the United States, where in the eyes of the\nDepartment of Justice he had betrayed the United States by stealing\nsecrets and taking them abroad. What recourse did Snowden have?\nIn a word, the FSB held all the cards but one— Snowden’s help with\nthe stolen documents. Even if Snowden disliked the tactics of the\nRussian security services, he now had a powerful inducement not to\ndecline the requests of the Russian authorities.\nTwo weeks after his arrival, the Russian authorities provided him\nwith a convenient path to full cooperation with Russia. He was put\nin contact with Anatoly Grigorievich Kucherena, a silver- haired,\nfifty- two- year- old lawyer who is known to be a personal friend of\nPutin’s. Kucherena did tasks for Putin’s party in the Russian parliament,\nor Duma. He had excellent connections in the Russian security\napparatus because he served on the oversight committee of the\nFSB. Kucherena offered to serve as Snowden’s pro bono lawyer. On\nJuly 12, Snowden officially retained him as his legal representative in\nMoscow. In explaining the relationship, Kucherena said, “Officially,\nhe is my client, but at the same time, I provide a number of other\nservices to him.” According to Kucherena, Snowden turned down\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 167\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n168 | how america lost its secrets\nall requests to meet with any representative of the U.S. embassy in\nMoscow. From that point on, he would act as Snowden’s go- between\nwith the FSB and other Russian agencies.\nAt the outset, Kucherena made it clear to Snowden that he would\nhave to play by Moscow’s rules before the Kremlin would grant him\npermission to stay in Russia. To begin with, Snowden had to withdraw\nany applications he had made elsewhere for asylum. He had to\nput his fate entirely in the hands of Putin’s Russia. He would also\nhave to be fully candid with the Russian authorities on what was of\ngreat value to Putin: the secret documents he had acquired.\nEighteen days later, Snowden received Russian identification\npapers that allowed him to resettle in Moscow. He was provided\nwith a residence and allowed to set up a broadcasting studio in it\nthat he could use for Internet appearances at well- attended events\naround the world, such as South by Southwest and TED. Snowden\nwas, according to Kucherena, also furnished with bodyguards. To\nhelp earn his keep, he was said by Kucherena to be employed at an\nunidentified Moscow cyber- security firm. To complete his resettlement,\nLindsay Mills, whom he had left behind in Hawaii, was given\na three- month visa and was allowed to temporarily live with him in\nMoscow. This afforded him a lifestyle that Snowden described in an\ninterview as “great.”\nIt would strain credibility that such privileges would be awarded to\nan intelligence defector who had refused to cooperate with Russian\nauthorities. In Snowden’s case, he was even allowed to participate in\nPutin’s telethon on state- controlled television. On it, he was called\non to ask Putin if the Russian government violated the privacy of\nRussian citizens in the same way that the American government\nviolated the rights of its citizens. Putin, smiling at Snowden’s presumably\nvetted question, answered in a single word: “No.”\nIn the Moscow scenario, the Russians acted to advance their interests.\nThey gave Snowden sanctuary, support, perks, and high- level\ntreatment because he agreed to cooperate with them. If Snowden\nhad not paid this basic price of admission, either in Russia or before\nhis arrival, he would not have been accorded this privileged status.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 168\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nc h a p t e r 17\nThe Keys to the Kingdom\nAre Missing\nThere’s a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have\nreceived any documents.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2013\nA\ncritical missing piece in the Snowden enigma is the whereabouts\nof the NSA documents. Greenwald told the Associated\nPress that the documents that Snowden had taken from the NSA\nconstituted “the instruction manual for how the NSA is built” and\nthat they “would allow somebody who read them to know exactly\nhow the NSA does what it does, which would in turn allow them to\nevade that surveillance or replicate it.” Snowden, for his part, said on\ncamera in his Hong Kong interview in June 2013 that NSA investigators\nwould have “a heart attack” when they discovered the extent\nof the breach.\nLedgett, the NSA official who had conducted the damage assessment,\nwhile not having a heart attack, confirmed that Snowden had\ntaken a massive number of documents and among them was what\nhe deemed the NSA’s “keys to the kingdom.” These keys could presumably\nopen up the mechanism through which the United States\nlearns about the secret activities of other nations and, by doing so,\nbring down the American signals intelligence system that had for\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 169\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n170 | how america lost its secrets\nsixty years monitored government communications. It had also kept\ntrack of adversaries’ missile telemetry, submarine movements, and\nnuclear proliferation.\nThe Snowden breach was not without precedent at the NSA.\nThere had been two Russian spies at the NSA during the Cold\nWar, Jack Dunlap and David Sheldon Boone, who took a limited\nnumber of documents, but no one since the end of the Cold War\nis known to have taken a single NSA classified document. Now an\ninsider had removed a vast number of the NSA’s documents. Many\nof these documents were classified TS/SCI— “Top Secret, Sensitive\nCompartmented Information”— which, as NSA secrets went, were\ndeemed the gold standard of espionage because they revealed the\nsources used in communications intelligence. Whatever the assessment\nof Snowden’s motivation, the single question that needed to be\nanswered was, what happened to these stolen files?\nRecall the huge disparity between the number of documents that\nthe NSA calculated that Snowden compromised and the number of\ndocuments he is known to have handed over to journalists in Hong\nKong on a thumb drive. When the House and Senate Intelligence\nCommittees asked the NSA how many documents Snowden took,\nthe NSA could not come up with a definitive number despite having\nemployed a world- class team of experts to reconstruct the crime. The\nNSA could say that 1.7 million documents had been selected in two\ndozen NSA computers during Snowden’s brief tenure at Booz Allen\nin 2013, including documents from the Department of Defense, the\nNSA, and the CIA. Of these “touched” documents, some 1.3 million\nhad been copied and moved to another computer.\nThere was evidence that Snowden had used preprogrammed spiders\nto find and index the documents. He had said that he took the\njob at Booz Allen to get access to data that he copied. So as far as the\nNSA was concerned, of course, the 1.3 million documents he copied\nand moved were considered compromised. On top of this haul,\nSnowden had copied files while working at Dell in 2012. As a system\nadministrator there, he could download data without leaving a\ndigital trail. As previously mentioned, more than half the documents\nactually published in newspapers had been taken during Snowden’s\ntime at Dell.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 170\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Keys to the Kingdom Are Missing | 171\nSnowden’s supporters do not accept that he stole such a large number\nof documents. According to Greenwald, the NSA vastly exaggerated\nthe magnitude of the theft in order to “demonize” Snowden.\nSnowden also disputed the magnitude of the 1.7 million number. He\ntold James Bamford of Wired in early 2014 that he took far fewer\nthan the 1.7 million documents that the NSA reported were compromised.\nHe offered, however, no more specific details on the magnitude\nof his theft. Nor did he offer Bamford any way to verify his\nassertion other than to say that he had purposely left behind “a trail\nof digital bread crumbs” at the NSA base in Hawaii so that the NSA\ncould determine which documents he “touched” but did not download.\nA government official familiar with the investigation said no\nsuch “bread crumbs” were found by the NSA.\nIt is possible that the NSA Damage Assessment team under Ledgett\nfalsified its findings or otherwise inflated the number of documents\nthat Snowden stole. NSA executives might have also lied\nto Congress to exaggerate the loss. But why would these officials\nengage in an orchestrated deception that made them look bad? Exaggerating\nthe magnitude of the theft would only magnify Ledgett and\nthe NSA’s failure in its mission to protect U.S. secrets.\nOfficials had no reason to demonize Snowden for legal reasons.\nHe already had been. Greenwald and Poitras had already revealed\nthat Snowden had given them a vast number of NSA classified documents\non a thumb drive that revealed, as Greenwald put it, the “blueprints”\nof the NSA. This drive contained, it will be recalled, no fewer\nthan 58,000 highly classified documents. In the eyes of the law, that\nconstituted an unprecedented breach of the laws passed to protect\ncommunications intelligence. In any case, in Russia Snowden was\nnot in any jeopardy, no matter how many documents he was said to\nhave stolen. Interestingly, the thirty- five- page Defense Intelligence\nAgency’s damage assessment reports that 900,000 Pentagon documents\ncompromised by Snowden were not made public. That was\nonly disclosed via a Vice magazine Freedom of Information request\nin June 2015.\nMany of the putative 1.3 million documents that the NSA says\nwere copied and moved were duplicate copies. Others were outdated\nor otherwise useless routing data. So the quantity does not tell the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 171\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n172 | how america lost its secrets\nwhole story. Of far more importance is the quality of some of the\ndata that Snowden had copied. Just a single one of these documents\ncould cripple not just the NSA but America’s entire multibilliondollar\napparatus for intercepting foreign intelligence. The previously\ncited road map, which was thirty- one thousand pages long, listed\ncritical gaps in U.S. coverage of China, Russia, and other adversaries,\nincluding those cited by President Obama’s national security team.\nIt was not found among the files on the thumb drive given to Poitras\nand Greenwald. Nor were most of the missing Level 3 lists concerning\nNSA activities in Russia and China found on the thumb drive,\neven though Snowden said he had taken his final job at Booz Allen\nto get access to these lists. If Snowden had not given these documents\nto Poitras, Greenwald, or other journalists, where were they?\nThe compartment logs showed that Snowden copied and transferred\nthese Level 3 documents in his final week at the NSA. He\npresumably had them in his possession in Hong Kong when he\narrived on May 20. On June 3, according to Greenwald, Snowden\nwas still sorting through the documents to determine which ones\nwere appropriate to give to journalists. On June 12, he told the\nreporter Lana Lam in Hong Kong that he was going through the\ndocuments, country by country, to determine which additional ones\nhe should pass on to journalists. Eleven days later, he departed Hong\nKong for Moscow carrying at least one laptop computer. After arriving\nin Moscow, he suggested he still had NSA secrets in his possession.\n“No intelligence service— not even our own— has the capacity\nto compromise the secrets I continue to protect,” he wrote to the\nformer senator Gordon Humphrey. “I cannot be coerced into revealing\nthat information, even under torture.” Much of the material he\ncopied while working at Booz Allen remained, as far as the NSA\ncould determine, missing. Had he brought these files under his “protection”\nto Russia?\nAn answer soon came from Snowden’s Moscow lawyer. On September\n23, Anatoly Kucherena was extensively interviewed on the\nRT channel in Russia. The interviewer, Sophie Shevardnadze, who\nhad a show called SophieCo, was a well- admired journalist. She is\nthe granddaughter of Eduard Shevardnadze, a former foreign minis-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 172\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Keys to the Kingdom Are Missing | 173\nter and Politburo member of the Soviet Union and, after the Soviet\nUnion broke up, the first president of Georgia. Even though she had\ninterviewed many top political figures in Russia, obtaining an hourlong\ninterview with Kucherena was a coup because, until then, he\nhad not discussed Snowden in a television interview.\nAbout halfway through the interview, Shevardnadze brought\nup the highly sensitive subject of the disposition of the NSA documents.\nIf anyone was in a position to know about these documents,\nit was Kucherena. He had acted as an intermediary for Snowden\nin his negotiations with Russian authorities, including the FSB. As\nsuch, he would be privy to the status of the secret material that was\nof interest to the Russian intelligence services. When I interviewed\nKucherena in Moscow in 2015, he told me that “all the reports” concerning\nSnowden had been turned over to him by “Russian authorities”\nin July 2013. “I had all of Snowden’s statements,” he said. If so,\nhe presumably knew what Snowden had told the Russian security\nservices.\nHad Snowden come to Russia with empty hands or bearing gifts?\nShevardnadze directly asked Kucherena if Snowden had given all\nthe documents he had taken from the NSA to journalists in Hong\nKong. Kucherena answered her question without any evasion, saying\nthat Snowden had only given “some” of the NSA’s documents in\nhis possession to journalists in Hong Kong. He had kept the remaining\ndocuments in his possession. That confirmed what Snowden had\ntold Greenwald, Poitras, and Lam in Hong Kong. Snowden told them\nthat he had divided the stolen NSA documents into two separate sets\nof documents. One set he gave to Poitras and Greenwald on thumb\ndrives. The other set, which he told them he considered too sensitive\nfor these journalists, he retained for himself. U.S. investigators\nat the NSA, the CIA, and the Department of Defense would like to\nknow what Snowden did with the set of documents he had retained\nfor himself and had not shared with the journalists in Hong Kong.\nShevardnadze, who makes it a point to drill her interviewees,\npressed Kucherena as to whether Snowden still had these NSA files,\nor “material,” in Russia. The dialogue went as follows (from the\ntranscript supplied to me by Shevardnadze).\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 173\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n174 | how america lost its secrets\nshevardnadze: So he [Snowden] does have some materials that\nhaven’t been made public yet?\nkucherena: Certainly.\nShevardnadze asked the next logical question: “Why did Russia\nget involved in this whole thing if it got nothing out of it?”\n“Snowden spent quite a few years working for the CIA. We haven’t\nfully realized yet the importance of his revelations.” Kucherena was\non the FSB’s public oversight board. He was clearly in the picture.\nKucherena’s answer was completely consistent with the statement\nSnowden made three weeks after arriving in Russia in his previously\nmentioned e- mail to Senator Humphrey.\nIt is certainly possible that Snowden transferred the NSA files\nfrom his own computers and thumb drives to storage on a remote\nserver in the cloud before coming to Russia. The “cloud” is actually\nnot in the sky but a term used for remote storage servers, such as\nthose provided by Dropbox, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and other\nInternet companies. Anyone who is connected to the Internet can\nstore and retrieve files by entering a user name and a password.\nFor Kucherena to be certain Snowden had access to the so- farunrevealed\ndata, Snowden must have demonstrated his access either\nto him or to the authorities. The Russians obviously knew Snowden\nhad the means to retrieve this data one way or the other. Because the\ndata concerned electronic espionage against Russia, the FSB would\nhave been keen to obtain the documents, and the FSB is not known\nto take no for an answer in issues involving espionage.\nEven if Snowden refused to furnish his key encryption, according\nto a former National Security Council staffer, the Russian cyber\nservice in 2013 had the means, the time, and the incentive to break\nthe encryption. It is unlikely it would have had to go through the\ntrouble. It doesn’t take a great stretch of the imagination to conclude\nthat, willingly or under duress, Snowden shared his access to his\ntreasure trove of documents with the agencies that were literally in\ncontrol of his life in Russia.\nKucherena’s answer on the television program may also help to\nexplain Putin’s decision to allow Snowden to come to Moscow. It\nwas not a minor sacrifice for Putin. His foreign minister, Sergei Lav-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 174\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Keys to the Kingdom Are Missing | 175\nrov, had spent almost six months negotiating with Hillary Clinton’s\nState Department a one- on- one summit between President Obama\nand President Putin. Not only would this summit be a diplomatic\ncoup for Russia, but also it would add to Putin’s personal credibility\nin advance of the Olympic Games in Russia. In mid- June, after\nU.S. intelligence reported to Obama’s national security adviser that\nSnowden was in contact with Russian officials in Hong Kong, the\nState Department explicitly told Lavrov that allowing Snowden\nto defect to Russia would be viewed by President Obama as a blatantly\nunfriendly act. As such, it could (and did) lead to the cancellation\nof the planned summit. Putin knew the downside of admitting\nSnowden.\nBut if Snowden had a large archive of files containing the sources\nof the NSA’s electronic interceptions, as Snowden claimed he had in\nHong Kong, there was an enormous potential intelligence upside.\nPutin had to choose between the loss of an Obama summit and\nan intelligence coup. Would Putin have made the choice he did if\nSnowden had destroyed, or refused to share, the stolen data?\n“No country, not even the United States, would grant sanctuary\nto an intelligence defector who refused to be cooperative,” answered\na former CIA officer who had spent a decade dealing with Russian\nintelligence defectors. “That’s not how it works.” If so, it seems plausible\nto believe that, as Kucherena said, the documents Snowden\nbrought to Russia explain why Russia exfiltrated him from Hong\nKong and provided him with a safe haven.\nThe Quickly Changing Narrative\nThree weeks after Kucherena’s appearance on Shevardnadze’s show,\non October 17, Snowden had his first interview exchange with a\njournalist since his arrival in Russia. It was over the Internet with\nJames Risen of The New York Times, as noted earlier. Snowden now\nasserted a very different narrative. The subsequent front- page story,\nwhich carried the headline “Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files\nto Russia,” reported that Snowden claimed he gave all his documents\nto journalists in Hong Kong and brought none of them to Russia. He\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 175\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n176 | how america lost its secrets\nalso said that he was “100 percent” certain that no foreign intelligence\nservice had had access to them at any point during his journey\nfrom Honolulu to Moscow. When I later asked Kucherena in Moscow\nwhy Snowden changed his story in direct contradiction of what\nKucherena had stated, he said, “Wizner.”\nHe was referring to Ben Wizner, Snowden’s ACLU lawyer in\nWashington, D.C. Wizner had joined the ACLU in August 2001\nafter graduating from NYU Law School and clerking for a federal\njudge. At the ACLU, he became an effective foe of NSA surveillance.\n“I had spent ten years before this [Snowden leak] trying to bring\nlawsuits against the intelligence community,” he explained in an\ninterview with Forbes in 2014. Prior to the Snowden leak, he had\nfrequently been consulted by Poitras on government surveillance\nissues (and appeared in Poitras’s 2010 documentary, The Oath). He\nhad also been engaged in a lawsuit aimed at exposing the NSA’s subpoenas\nfor Verizon records.\nHe had first learned about Snowden from Poitras in January\n2013 while Snowden was still working for Dell at the NSA base in\nHawaii. At that time, Poitras did not know Snowden’s real name, but\nshe informed Wizner that she was in touch with a person identifying\nhimself as a senior officer in U.S. intelligence. (Poitras did not\nknow at that time that her source, Snowden, was lying to her about\nhis position.) Wizner also was shown e-mails by Poitras in which\nSnowden said he had information about the government’s secret\ndomestic surveillance program. Wizner, according to Poitras, advised\nher to stay in touch with this source.\nOn July 13, 2013, after Snowden asked for asylum in Russia,\nKucherena arranged an encrypted chat between Snowden and Wizner.\nAccording to Wizner, Snowden asked him at the outset, “Do you\nhave standing now?” It was a question that suggested that Snowden\nwas aware that the ACLU needed to gain standing in federal court to\nchallenge the government’s alleged domestic surveillance. Up until\nnow, it was unsuccessful because it had no way to show it was a victim\nof surveillance. The FISA order to Verizon, which Snowden had\ntaken had provided that standing to Wizner and the ACLU.\nAside from the opportunity Snowden offered the ACLU, Wizner\nno doubt believed in the salutary benefit of Snowden’s revela-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 176\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Keys to the Kingdom Are Missing | 177\ntions. When they discussed Snowden’s legal situation in America,\nSnowden expressed an interest in obtaining some form of amnesty\nfrom prosecution. Wizner was willing to attempt to explore making\na possible deal with the Department of Justice, but it would not be an\neasy task, especially if Snowden had turned over NSA documents to\na foreign power.\nEven to argue that Snowden was merely an NSA whistle- blower\npresented a serious challenge for Wizner. The ACLU had been\ninvolved with previous NSA whistle- blowers, but Snowden’s case\ndiffered from those cases in important ways. Those whistle- blowers\nhad not intentionally taken any NSA documents. Snowden, on the\nother hand, had not only taken a large number of NSA documents\nbut also released tens of thousands of these top secret files to journalists\nbased in Germany and Brazil, as well as to other unauthorized\nrecipients. In addition, the Whistleblower Protection Act, passed\nby Congress in 1989, does not exempt an insider, such as Snowden,\nwho signs a secrecy oath from the legal consequences of disclosing\nclassified documents to journalists or other unauthorized people.\nConsequently, getting some form of amnesty for Snowden required\nbolstering his image as a person taking personal risks to fight for\nAmerica. But if Snowden had taken even a single top secret document\nto Russia, it would strengthen the case in the court of public\nopinion that he had stolen communications intelligence secrets with\nthe intent to damage the United States, which under the provisions\nof federal law could be considered espionage. In this regard, Kucherena’s\ndisclosure was extremely damaging to Snowden’s position, and\nSnowden had, after all, already found refuge in Russia. Snowden\nhad two options, according to Wizner, the “first is to be where he is\nin Russia. And the second is to be in a maximum security prison cell,\ncut off from the world.” These, of course, would be the options of\nany espionage defector who fled to Russia.\nOne way to mitigate the damage was for Snowden to substitute\na new narrative. Wizner took it upon himself to screen potential\njournalists and other outlets for Snowden. He told a reporter for\nThe New York Times that, except for Oliver Stone, all individuals\nwho have “met with Snowden have just gone through me, and\nwe’ve hooked it up.” Nor did he limit his extraordinary control to\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 177\n9/30/16 11:09 AM\n178 | how america lost its secrets\ninterviews. In the case of Stone’s movie Snowden, Wizner asked for\nthe right to veto any shots featuring Snowden in the film. In it, he\nwould tell handpicked journalists that he had given all his documents\nto Poitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong and took none of\nthem to Russia. Wizner could then argue that documents such as the\nFISA court order were improperly classified secret and that disclosing\nthem served the public good. The government might not be able\nto contest his claim without further revealing NSA sources. Under\nthese circumstances, it might be induced to agree to a plea bargain\nfor Snowden. Changing the narrative would also help enhance his\npublic image as a whistle- blower.\nSnowden’s new narrative that he had destroyed all the documents\nhe had in his possession before coming to Moscow and had no access\nto any NSA documents, not even those that he had distributed to\njournalists, was reinforced in a series of interviews that Wizner\nhelped arrange. “I went the first six months without giving an interview,”\nSnowden later said. “It wasn’t until December 2013 that I\ngave my first interview to Barton Gellman.” (Snowden did not count\nhis Internet exchange with Risen in October as an “interview”.)\nIn late December 2013, Snowden met with Barton Gellman. It was\nhis first face- to- face meeting with a journalist since he had arrived in\nRussia in June. Snowden turned his laptop toward Gellman and, as\nif proving his point, said to him, “There’s nothing on it. . . . My hard\ndrive is completely blank.” That his computer had no files stored on\nit at that moment of course meant very little. Just six weeks earlier,\nSnowden had met with the former CIA officer Ray McGovern, who\nhad been invited to meet him in Moscow along with three other\nAmerican whistle- blowers. At that meeting, he told McGovern that\nhe had stored all the NSA data he had taken on external hard drives.\nGellman asked about the precise whereabouts of the files, but, as he\nreported, Snowden declined to answer that question. He would only\nsay that he was “confident he did not expose them to Chinese intelligence\nin Hong Kong.” That answer did not nail down the issue,\nso Wizner arranged for Vanity Fair, which was preparing an article\non Snowden, to submit questions. In his reply to them, Snowden\nwrote that he destroyed all his files in Hong Kong because he didn’t\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 178\n9/30/16 11:09 AM\nThe Keys to the Kingdom Are Missing | 179\nwant to risk bringing them to Russia. He expanded on this claim in\nthree more interviews. These interviews were all with three journalists\nwho had opposed NSA surveillance: James Bamford, writing\nfor Wired magazine; Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian;\nand Katrina vanden Heuvel, the editor of The Nation. He also gave\na televised interview to Brian Williams of NBC News in which he\nexplained that because he had no access to the NSA documents in\nRussia, he could not provide access to the Russians even if they\n“break my fingers.”\nSnowden did not specify where, when, or how the putative\ndestruction of the files occurred and offered neither witnesses nor\nevidence, other than the meaningless blank laptop screen, to corroborate\nit. Still his new self- serving narrative was widely accepted\nby the media. The fact remains, though, that Snowden went to considerable\nrisk to select, copy, and steal Level 3 documents before\nleaving Hawaii for Hong Kong. These secrets were his last potential\nbargaining chips. Why would he have destroyed them in June in\nHong Kong?\nIt is also difficult for me to accept that Snowden would destroy\nthese documents because he feared the Russians might get them.\nIf he was so concerned about the possibility, he could have stayed\nin Hong Kong and fought extradition instead of flying to Russia.\nSurely he must have realized that even without the files on his computer,\nthe Russian intelligence service could still obtain the NSA\nsecrets he held in his head. Indeed, as he told the Times, the secrets\nhe held in his head would have devastating consequences for NSA\noperations.\nIn light of Kucherena’s statement that in Russia Snowden had\naccess to NSA documents, it would require a serious suspension of\ndisbelief to accept Snowden’s new narrative. Even if one were willing\nto accept his new claim, it still would not mean that the NSA\ndocuments had not fallen into the hands of adversaries. If he had\ndestroyed all of the electronic copies of the NSA’s data before boarding\nhis flight to Moscow, he still couldn’t be “100 percent” certain, as\nhe claimed, that the data had not been accessed by others prior to his\ndeparture from Hong Kong. His files could have been copied with-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 179\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n180 | how america lost its secrets\nout his knowledge, just as he had copied them without the NSA’s\nknowledge. As former U.S. intelligence officers pointed out to me,\nadversary services could not be expected to shirk from employing\ntheir full capabilities once they learned that an American “agent of\nspecial services,” as Putin called him, had brought stolen NSA documents\nto Hong Kong.\nThe Times reported from Hong Kong that two sources, both of\nwhom worked for major government intelligence agencies, “said\nthey believed that the Chinese government had managed to drain\nthe contents” of the laptop that Snowden brought to Hong Kong.\nThat China had the capability to obtain Snowden’s data was also\nthe view of the former CIA deputy director Morell. He said, “Both\nthe Chinese and the Russians would have used everything in their\ntool kit— from human approaches to technical attacks— to get at\nSnowden’s stolen data.”\nSnowden would not have been a particularly difficult target for\nthem, especially after he started disclosing secrets to journalists at\nthe Mira hotel. Not only could the Chinese service approach the\nsecurity staff at the Mira, but they could track him after he left the\nhotel and moved, along with his computers, in and out of several\nresidences arranged by his carer. Snowden, after all, had put himself\nin the hands of people whom he had never met before, including\nthree Hong Kong lawyers, a carer, and three Guardian journalists.\nIt is likely that the efforts of these adversary intelligence services to\nfind him, and the NSA data, would further intensify after Snowden\nrevealed to the South China Morning Post on June 12 that he had\naccess to NSA lists of computers in China and elsewhere that the\nNSA had penetrated.\nIt wouldn’t be only the Chinese service on his trail. The Russian\nintelligence service would also likely be tasked to acquire these\nNSA documents after Snowden’s meeting with Russian officials in\nHong Kong. And while he could get away with giving coy and elusive\nanswers to journalists who asked him about the whereabouts of\nthe NSA data, the Russian and Chinese officials in Hong Kong who\ncould offer him an escape route from prison would likely demand\nmore specific answers about the whereabouts of data they had not\nalready obtained by technical means.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 180\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Keys to the Kingdom Are Missing | 181\nThe Post– Hong Kong Documents\nThe NSA concern about who had access to its missing files deepened\nfurther when NSA documents continued to surface in the press after\nSnowden went to Moscow. If U.S. intelligence needed any further\nevidence that someone had access to the documents, these additional\nrevelations provided it.\nThe most sensational of them was a purported document attributed\nto Snowden concerning the NSA hacking of the cell phone of\nthe German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The story was published\non October 23 on the Der Spiegel website. Appelbaum was the coauthor\nof the story. Even though Snowden had by now been in Russia\nfor four months, he was cited in the story, along with unnamed\n“others,” as the source for the NSA document. Snowden did not\ndeny it. Indeed, he took a measure of credit for the revelation, saying\non German TV, “What I can say is we know Angela Merkel was\nmonitored by the National Security Agency.” If Snowden had been\ninvolved in the release of this document, it would be consistent with\nKucherena’s assertion that he had access to the archive.\nAdding to the intrigue, Poitras was apparently caught by surprise\nwhen the Merkel story broke in Der Spiegel. She urgently texted\nSnowden on what she called “background” (which ordinarily means\nthat a journalist will not attribute information to a source). She asked\nhim in the text to explain the NSA’s actions. Snowden explained to\nher that Merkel was listed by her true name (and not by a code name)\nin the NSA document because the German chancellor was an NSA\n“target not an asset.” Presumably, Poitras would have already known\nthat distinction if she had the document referred to in Der Spiegel.\nIf the Merkel document was not among the data given to Poitras in\nHong Kong, how did it get to the authors of the Der Spiegel article?\nAppelbaum, of course, had been in contact with Snowden before he\nwent public. He had served as Poitras’s co- interrogator of Snowden\nwhile he was still working at the NSA in May 2013. Appelbaum\nwas also one of the leading supporters of WikiLeaks. Because he\nwas famously an advocate of revealing government secrets, it seems\nunlikely that he would have delayed releasing such a bombshell\nabout Merkel’s phone if Snowden had given him this document\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 181\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n182 | how america lost its secrets\nbefore he left Hong Kong in June 2013. Why would Appelbaum keep\nit secret for more than four months? The same pressure to publish\nwould also apply to the journalists Snowden had dealt with in Hong\nKong. If Snowden had given Poitras, Greenwald, Lam, or MacAskill\nthe Merkel document, or even told them about it in their interviews\nwith him in Hong Kong, The Guardian would have certainly rushed\nout such a scoop.\nAccording to a source with knowledge of the Snowden investigation,\nthere was no document referencing any spying on Merkel’s\nphone among the fifty- eight thousand documents on the thumb\ndrive that Snowden had given to Poitras and Greenwald in Hong\nKong. That absence would explain why Poitras had to send a text to\nSnowden in Moscow to ask for an explanation after the story broke.\nFurther confirmation of the absence of this document in the\nmaterial Snowden provided journalists in Hong Kong comes from\nJames Bamford, a well- respected expert on the NSA. In the course\nof researching his 2014 article on Snowden for Wired, he was given\naccess to all the documents Snowden gave to Poitras, Greenwald, and\nGellman. Bamford used a sophisticated indexing program to search\nthrough the database specifically for the Merkel material. He did not\nfind any. He reported that no document given to journalists in Hong\nKong even mentioned Merkel. It therefore appeared that the Merkel\ndocument was provided to Der Spiegel after Snowden went to Moscow.\nIf so, some party had access to NSA documents after Snowden\narrived in Russia and provided the Der Spiegel authors with the\nscoop. In that context, it might not have been a pure coincidence that\nKucherena disclosed that Snowden had access to documents that he\nhad not given to journalists in Hong Kong shortly before just such a\ndocument was published in Germany.\nBamford explored the possibility that there might be another person\nin the NSA who was stealing documents. He wrote to Poitras\nand asked her whether the Merkel document could have come from\nanother person in the NSA. She declined, via a letter from her lawyer,\nto answer that question. But because she had not been the author of\nthe Der Spiegel article, and had not been given the document, there\nis no reason to believe that she would know its provenance.\nDocuments continued to emerge years after Snowden arrived in\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 182\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Keys to the Kingdom Are Missing | 183\nMoscow that were more embarrassing to America. In June 2015, the\nWikiLeaks website released another putative Snowden document,\ntwo years after he had supposedly wiped his computer clean in Hong\nKong. It revealed that the NSA had targeted the telephones of three\nconsecutive presidents of France— Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy,\nand François Hollande.\nAccording to a former NSA official, this document, like the 2013\nMerkel material, was not among the data on the thumb drive given\nto journalists in Hong Kong, which Greenwald confirmed. Greenwald\nsuggested to The New York Times that it might have been stolen\nby another penetration in the NSA, presumably one who had\naccess to the same secret compartments as Snowden in 2013. Since\nGreenwald and Poitras had no way of knowing about the documents\nthat Snowden did not give them, it is equally possible that the Russian\nintelligence services obtained this document from Snowden and\nlater gave it to WikiLeaks. The release on Assange’s WikiLeaks site\ncame in the midst of NATO war games held near the Russian border,\nwhich Putin had vehemently denounced. The accompanying article\nwas co- authored by Assange, who now claimed to have access to\nSnowden’s NSA material. Because Assange had been in telephonic\ncontact with Snowden in Hong Kong, and his deputy, Sarah Harrison,\nhad spent five months in Moscow with Snowden in 2013, it\nis certainly possible Snowden was his source. But it seems difficult\nto believe that Assange waited two years before publishing because\nhe has made it part of his modus operandi to publish documents\nimmediately. Because WikiLeaks receives documents anonymously\nvia its Tor software, any party with access to the Snowden files\ncould have sent it. Subsequently, in July 2016, Assange released via\nWikiLeaks a cache of politically disruptive documents from the files\nof the Democratic National Committee. U.S. intelligence strongly\nsuspected they been stolen by the Russian intelligence services and\nsent to WikiLeaks. If so, Russia made use of Assange and WikiLeaks\nto exploit selected fruits of its espionage activities\nGreenwald and Poitras also released belated documents. On\nJuly 15, 2015, their web publication, The Intercept, released a\nSnowden document that cited an NSA intercept of an Israeli military\ncommunication concerning an Israeli raid in Syria on August 1,\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 183\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n184 | how america lost its secrets\n2008. It revealed that a group of Israeli commandos killed General\nMuhammad Suleiman, a top aide to President Bashar al- Assad\nwho had been working with North Korea to build a nuclear facility\nin Syria. Israel had destroyed that facility in Operation Orchard\nnearly a year earlier. Whatever the purpose of this new release of an\nNSA document (which had little if anything to do with any of the\nNSA’s own operations), it was not among the data that Snowden had\ngiven Poitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong in 2013, according to a\nsource with access to the investigation. Next, on January 28, 2016,\nThe Intercept published data taken from a GHCQ (the British cipher\nservice) file furnished by Snowden revealing military intelligence\nactivities abroad. Specifically, it disclosed that the United States and\nBritain were intercepting data from Israel’s military drones in 2008.\nBritish intelligence had determined in 2013 that the material sent\nto Greenwald via a courier did not contain such GCHQ documents.\nIf that is the case, then Poitras and Greenwald, like Appelbaum and\nAssange, were still receiving NSA documents that Snowden had\nallegedly stolen a long time after he went to Russia and claimed he\nhad destroyed all his files.\nThe NSA reportedly determined that these belated documents,\nmost of which concerned American allies in Germany, France, and\nIsrael, had been among the material copied during the Snowden\nbreach. They provided further reason to believe that someone still\nhad access to the documents that were not distributed to journalists\nin Hong Kong. Kucherena’s disclosure, just before the first post–\nHong Kong release, that Snowden still had access to the NSA files\nmade it appear plausible that Snowden sent these documents to Der\nSpiegel, WikiLeaks, and The Intercept.\nA former high- ranking KGB officer I interviewed had a very different\nview. He told me that in his experience an intelligence defector\nto Russia would not be allowed to distribute secret material to\njournalists without explicit approval by the security service tending\nhim. He added that this injunction would be especially true in\nthe case of Snowden because Putin had publicly enjoined him from\nreleasing U.S. intelligence data. The more plausible alternative was\nthat this material was released at the behest of the Russian intelligence\nservice.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 184\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Keys to the Kingdom Are Missing | 185\nThe mystery of the post– Hong Kong documents also intrigued\nmembers of the U.S. intelligence community with whom I discussed\nit. When I asked a former intelligence executive about the ultimate\nsource for the Merkel story, he responded, “If Snowden didn’t give\njournalists this document in Hong Kong, we can assume an intermediary\nfed it to Appelbaum to publish in Der Spiegel.” According\nto him, the NSA investigation had determined that Snowden indeed\nhad copied an NSA list of the cell phone numbers of foreign leaders,\nincluding the number of Merkel. This list became the basis of the\nDer Spiegel story.\nIt was also clear that Snowden gave credence to the release in Moscow.\nHe made a major point about the hacking of Merkel’s phone\nin an interview with Wired in 2014. Just about two weeks before\nthe leak, Kucherena said Snowden still had access to the documents.\nClearly, someone had access. But whoever was behind it, the release\nof information about the alleged bugging of Merkel’s phone resulted\nin badly fraying U.S. relations with Germany in the midst of developing\ntroubles in Ukraine. As it later turned out, according to the\ninvestigation of the German federal prosecutor, which concluded in\n2015, there was no evidence found in this document, or elsewhere,\nthat Merkel’s calls were ever actually intercepted. Although they\nrevealed little if anything that the intelligence services of Germany,\nFrance, and Israel were not already aware of, they raised a public\noutcry in allies against NSA surveillance, and the outcry became the\nevent itself.\nWhile these post– Hong Kong documents had little if any intelligence\nvalue, they provided further evidence that at least part of\nthe stolen NSA documents was in the hands of a party hostile to the\nUnited States. If so, it wasn’t much of a leap to assume that this party\nalso had access to the far more valuable Level 3 documents revealing\nthe NSA’s sources and methods, such as the one that Ledgett had\ndescribed as a “roadmap” to U.S. electronic espionage against Russia\nand China.\nWithin the intelligence community, this concern was heightened\nby new countermeasures to this espionage employed by Russia and\nChina after Snowden reached Moscow. For example, there were\nindications that the NSA had lost part of its capabilities to follow\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 185\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n186 | how america lost its secrets\nRussian troop movements in the Crimea and eastern Ukraine. U.S.\nintelligence officials even went so far as to suggest, according to a\nreport in The Wall Street Journal, that “Russian planners might\nhave gotten a jump on the West by evading U.S. eavesdropping.”\nBritain also discovered that some of its secret operations had been\ncompromised after Snowden went to Moscow. According to a 2015\nstory in the Sunday Times of London, British intelligence had determined\nthat Britain’s intelligence- gathering sources had been exposed\nto adversary services by documents that Snowden had stolen from\nthe NSA in 2013. These documents had been provided to the NSA\nby the GCHQ. Unless such intelligence disasters were freak aberrations,\nit appeared to confirm General Alexander’s warning in 2014\nthat the NSA was “losing some of its capabilities, because they’re\nbeing disclosed to our adversaries.”\nSnowden’s supporters disputed this view. If only as an act of faith\nin Snowden’s personal integrity, they continued to believe his avowal\nto Senator Humphrey that he had acted to protect U.S. secrets by\nshielding them from adversary intelligence services after he took\nthem abroad. They also continued to take him at his word when he\nsaid he had destroyed all the NSA documents before going to Russia.\nDespite such protestations of patriotic loyalty, U.S. intelligence\nofficials could not so easily dismiss the possibility that the missing\ndocuments still existed. After all, a U.S. intelligence worker who is\ndedicated to protecting America’s secrets from its adversaries does\nnot ordinarily steal them.\nThe NSA, the CIA, and the Department of Defense therefore\nhad little choice but to assume the worst had happened: Russia and\nChina had obtained access to the “keys to the kingdom.” Whatever\nthe extent of the actual damage, it was up to Alexander’s replacement,\nAdmiral Michael Rogers, both to restore morale and to rebuild\nthe capabilities of America’s electronic intelligence in the wake of\nthe massive breach. According to a national security staff member\nin the Obama White House, that job would take more than a decade.\nThe NSA had failed to protect vital assets. This intelligence failure\ndid not happen out of the blue.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 186\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nc h a p t e r 18\nThe Unheeded Warning\nThe NSA— the world’s most capable signals intelligence organization,\nan agency immensely skilled in stealing digital data— had\nhad its pockets thoroughly picked.\n— cia deputy director michael morell, 2015\nIn april 2010, the CIA received a stark reminder of the ongoing\nnature of Russian espionage. It came in the form of a message\nfrom one of its best- placed moles in the Russian intelligence service.\nThis surreptitious source was Alexander Poteyev, a fifty- four- yearold\ncolonel in the SVR, which was the successor agency to the first\nchief directorate of the KGB. While the FSB took over the KGB’s\ndomestic role in 1991, the SVR became Russia’s foreign intelligence\nservice. Its operation center was in the Yasenevo district of Moscow.\nThe CIA had recruited Poteyev as a mole in the 1990s when he had\nbeen stationed at the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C. That it\ncould sustain a mole in Moscow for over a decade attested to its capabilities\nin the espionage business. After he returned to Moscow, still\nsecretly on the CIA’s payroll, he became the deputy chief of the SVR’s\n“American” section. This unit of Russian intelligence had the primary\nresponsibility for establishing spies in the CIA, the FBI, the\nNSA, and other American intelligence agencies.\nThe SVR’s last known (or caught) mole in U.S. intelligence was\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 187\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n188 | how america lost its secrets\nthe CIA officer Harold Nicholson, in 1996. Before it could expand its\nespionage capabilities, it needed to build a network of Russian agents\nin the United States. For this network, it needed to groom so- called\nillegals, or agents who were not connected to the Russian embassy.\nThis so- called illegals network was necessary because presumably\nall Russian diplomats, including the so- called legal members of Russian\nintelligence, were under constant surveillance by the FBI.\nAdvances in surveillance technology in the twenty- first century\nmade it increasingly difficult to communicate with recruits through\nits diplomatic missions. To evade it, the “American” division of the\nSVR was given the task of placing individuals in the United States\ndisguised as ordinary Americans. Their “legend,” or operational\ncover, could be thin because they would not be applying for jobs in\nthe government. Their job was simply to blend in with their community\nuntil they were called upon by the “American” department\nin Moscow to service a mole who had been planted in U.S. intelligence\nor other parts of the U.S. government. Until they were activated\nby such a call, they were classified as sleeper agents. Unlike the\nSVR’s “legal” officers, who were attached to Russian embassies as\ndiplomats and were protected from arrest by the Treaty of Vienna,\nthe SVR’s illegal agents lack diplomatic immunity. According to\nPavel Sudoplatov, who defected from the KGB in the Cold War, the\nsole job of such sleeper agents was to “live under cover in the West\nawaiting assignments for the Center.” One assignment that justifies\nthe expense of maintaining such agents is to service a penetration,\nafter one is made, in the U.S. intelligence establishment. While waiting\nto be activated for such a job, sleeper agents were instructed to\nbuild every detail of their cover identity so as to perfectly blend in\nwith Americans.\nTo build this American network of sleeper agents took the better\npart of a decade. In 2005, the SVR’s “American” section in Moscow\nhad begun methodically installing them in the United States.\nAlmost all were Russian citizens who had assumed new identities to\nbetter blend into their communities.\nThe CIA learned of this sleeper program through Poteyev soon\nafter it began. The issue was how to exploit this knowledge. When I\nwas writing my book on international deception, James Jesus Angle-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 188\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Unheeded Warning | 189\nton had pointed out to me that “the business of intelligence services\nrequires understanding precisely the relationship of their opposition\nto them.” His view, though his opponents inside the CIA would\ncall it with some justification an obsession, was that an intelligence\nservice had to focus on the moves of its rivals. To accomplish this\n“business” in the first decade of the twenty- first century, the CIA\nhad to establish why its new opposition, the SVR, was laying the\nfoundation for an espionage operation. What were its priorities in\nthe resumption of the intelligence war? Its inside man in the SVR,\nPoteyev, provided it with a tremendous advantage in this relationship.\nHe knew the links in a sleeper network that the SVR believed\nwas safely hidden from surveillance. If they were followed, when\nthey were activated, they could expose whatever recruits the SVR\nhad in the American government. The CIA duly shared this information\nabout the sleeper ring with the FBI, which had the responsibility\nfor the surveillance of foreign agents in the United States.\nThe FBI, for its part, kept the Russian sleeper agents under tight\nsurveillance— an operation that grew in complexity and expense as\nmore SVR agents arrived in the United States.\nMeanwhile, in Moscow, Poteyev was following the unfolding\noperation. Part of his SVR job was to continue preparing these\n“Americans,” as they were called by the SVR, for their assignments.\nSome had been sent as couples, others as singles. One of the singles\nthat Poteyev personally handled was Anna Kushchyenko. She\nwas a strikingly beautiful Russian student who changed her name\nto Anna Chapman by briefly marrying a British citizen she met at\na rave party. After taking his name, she left him. After completing\nher training in Russia, she was sent by the SVR to New York City\nto establish herself as an international real estate specialist. Other\n“Americans” under Poteyev’s watch became travel agents, students,\nand financial advisers. In all, Poteyev identified to the CIA twelve\nsuch sleeper agents. The cost of FBI surveillance of them over the\nyears became sizable. According to a former FBI agent, around- theclock\nsurveillance on the movements and communications of a single\nindividual can cost over $10,000 a day.\nWhen the CIA received Poteyev’s message in 2010 warning that\nRussian military intelligence had asked the SVR to activate some of\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 189\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n190 | how america lost its secrets\nits sleeper agents for a highly sensitive assignment, that suggested\nRussian intelligence had found a possible source who could supply\nit with valuable information. According to a former CIA intelligence\nofficial who later became involved in the case, the assignment\ninvolved preparing these agents to service a potential source in the\nNSA at Fort Meade, Maryland. If true, it suggested that Russian\nintelligence either had found or was working on a means of penetrating\nthe NSA.\nIn 2010, the NSA division that handled such security and espionage\nthreats reportedly initiated a counterespionage probe at the\nNSA’s Fort Meade headquarters. According to a former NSA official,\n“They [were] looking for one or more Russian spies that NSA [was]\nconvinced resided at Fort Meade and possibly other DoD Intel offices,\nlike DIA.” Because the NSA’s cryptological service had in 2010\nthirty- five thousand military and civilian contractor employees, the\nsearch for a possible leak was no easy matter. According to a subsequent\nnote in the NSA’s secret budget report to Congress, it would\nrequire “a minimum of 4,000 periodic investigations of employees\nin position to compromise sensitive information” to safely guard\nagainst “insider threats by trusted insiders who seek to exploit their\nauthorized access to sensitive information to harm U.S. interests.”\nAccording to a former executive in the intelligence community,\nthat amount of investigation far exceeded the budgetary capabilities\nof the NSA. So while the investigation found no evidence of\nSVR recruitment, it remained possible that Russian intelligence had\nfound a candidate in the NSA.\nMeanwhile, in June 2010, to preempt such a leak in U.S. intelligence\nand avoid any potential embarrassment that could result, the\nFBI decided it could no longer engage in this sort of an intelligence\ngame with the sleeper network. It arrested all twelve sleeper agents\nidentified by Poteyev. After receiving a great deal of public attention\n(which led to their inspiring the FX series The Americans), the\nsleeper agents were deported to Russia. This move had both advantages\nand disadvantages. The main advantage was that it severed any\ncommunication link between the putative person of interest in the\nNSA and Russian intelligence via the sleeper agents. The main disadvantage\nwas that it eliminated the possibility that FBI surveillance\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 190\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Unheeded Warning | 191\nof the illegals might lead the FBI to a possible recruit in the NSA or\nelsewhere.\nThe preemptive arrests also had an unforeseen consequence.\nThey resulted in accidently compromising Poteyev. When Chapman\nreturned to Moscow after a spy exchange, she was taken to\na well- publicized dinner with Putin. Afterward, she informed her\ndebriefer at the SVR that only Poteyev had been in a position to\nknow the password that an FBI agent had used to try to deceive\nher into believing she was speaking to an SVR officer. This brought\nPoteyev under immediate suspicion. Tipped off by the CIA to the\nFBI’s error, Poteyev managed to escape by taking a train from Moscow\nto Belarus, where the CIA exfiltrated him to the United States.\nPoteyev had been saved from prison— or worse— but he was no longer\nuseful to the CIA as a mole. Without the services of Poteyev in\nthe SVR in Moscow, U.S. intelligence was unable to find out further\ndetails about the mission to which Poteyev’s sleeper agents were to\nbe assigned. All it had discovered was the history of the preparations\nfor a major espionage revival. It now knew that the SVR had\ninstalled plumbing in America and that one or more agents in this\nnetwork had been activated to handle a possible recruit in the NSA.\nBut without anyone left in the sleeper network to follow and without\nan inside source in the SVR, it had no further avenues to fruitfully\npursue. The revelation of the sleeper agents had little if any\nother intelligence value.\nThe NSA’s own security investigation turned up no evidence of a\nleak at Fort Meade in 2010. That of course doesn’t mean there hadn’t\nbeen one. The Russian intelligence service had demonstrated in the\npast that it was well schooled in covering its tracks in operations\nagainst U.S. communications intelligence. For example, CIA counterintelligence\nhad learned from a KGB defector in the early 1960s\nthat Russian intelligence had penetrated the cipher room at the U.S.\nembassy in Moscow and, because of this operation, the KGB was able\nto decipher crucial communications. Even so, it failed to find either\nthe perpetrator or any evidence of his existence for more than half\na century. The operation was only definitively revealed by the Russian\nspymaster Sergey Kondrashev in 2007. Tennent Bagley, who\nheaded the CIA’s Soviet bloc counterintelligence at the time, lately\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 191\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n192 | how america lost its secrets\nwrote in his book that the ability of Russian intelligence to conceal\nthis penetration for more than half a century “broke the record for\nsecret keeping.”\nThis Russian ability to penetrate U.S. intelligence was not entirely\ndefeated by America’s implementation of more sophisticated security\nprocedures, such as the polygraph examination and extensive\nbackground checks. In 1995, eleven years before Snowden joined it,\nthe CIA’s inspector general completed a study of the KGB’s use of\nfalse defectors to mislead the U.S. government from the end of the\nCold War in the late 1980s through the mid- 1990s. It found Russia\nhad dispatched at least half a dozen double agents who provided\nmisleading information to their CIA case officers.\nBecause the KGB operation went undetected for nearly a decade,\nthe disinformation prepared in Moscow had been incorporated into\nreports (which had a distinctive blue stripe to signify their importance)\nthat had been provided to Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush,\nand Bill Clinton. Even more shocking, in tracing the path of this\ndisinformation, the inspector general found that the “senior CIA\nofficers responsible for these reports had known that some of their\nsources for this information were controlled by Russian intelligence,”\nyet they did not inform the president and officials receiving\nthe blue- striped reports that they included Russian misinformation.\nWhat the CIA director John Deutch called “an inexcusable lapse”\nalso reflected a form of institutional willful blindness in U.S. intelligence,\nborne out of a bureaucratic fear of career embarrassment so\nwell described in Le Carré’s spy novels. Detecting intelligence failures\nhas, if anything, become even more difficult in the age of the\nanonymous Internet.\nThe Snowden breach demonstrated the NSA had few if any failsafe\ndefenses against would- be leakers of communications intelligence.\nIn the new domain of cyber warfare, conventional defensive\nrules do not apply. “There are no rivers or hills up here. It’s all flat.\nAll advantage goes to the attacker,” General Hayden said in an interview\nin 2015 with the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. His point\nwas that because there are no defensive positions, the United States\nin cyber warfare must rely on an aggressive offensive. If fully successful,\nsuch an offensive would so deeply penetrate the defenses of\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 192\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\nThe Unheeded Warning | 193\nan adversary’s intelligence organization that it could not mount any\nof its own surprise cyber attacks. It would also make it difficult if not\nimpossible for adversary services to recruit a spy in the NSA. For\nexample, the CIA penetration of the SVR in 2010 prevented it from\nusing its sleeper network against U.S. targets. “The best defense\nin this game may be an overwhelming offensive,” a former intelligence\nofficial said to me. “But that strategy only works if we can\nkeep secret sensitive sources.”\nCentral to this offensive strategy was the NSA’s National Threat\nOperations Center in Oahu. It employed threat analysts to surreptitiously\nmonitor the secret activities of potential enemies, mainly\nChina, Russia, and North Korea. A large part of their job was to\nmake transparent to the United States the hostile activities of the\nRussian and Chinese services so that they posed little if any intelligence\nthreat to America. This strategy worked so long as the NSA\nguarded itself, but it also raised the issue, as the Roman Juvenal\nfamously warned, “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” (Who will guard\nthe guards themselves?)\nLess than three years after the NSA had received the Poteyev\nwarning, instead of guarding secrets, Snowden stole them. Despite\nall the measures the NSA had taken to protect its vital secrets, a\nlowly civilian employee had walked away with the lists of secret\nNSA sources in China and Russia and then gone first to China and\nthen to Russia. In the hands of their intelligence services, these stolen\nlists had the potential to totally upend the NSA’s offensive strategy.\nBecause Russia and China have an intelligence treaty for sharing\nsuch spoils between them when it is to their mutual advantage, it\nhad to be assumed that if either country had acquired the secrets\nfrom Snowden, they would be shared between them, altering the\nbalance of power between the communications intelligence services\nof the United States and its adversaries.\nFollowing the Snowden breach, both China and Russia had\nimmense successes in breaking through the defenses of U.S. government\nnetworks, including the reported breaches in 2014 and 2015 of\nU.S. personnel files and background checks. When I asked General\nHayden in June 2015 if these successes were made easier by those\ndocuments compromised by Snowden, he replied, “Even though I\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 193\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\n194 | how america lost its secrets\ncannot make a direct correlation here, unarguably our adversaries\nknow far more about how we collect signals intelligence than they\never did before [Snowden].”\nIf Snowden could cause such massive damage, so could other civilian\ntrainees at the NSA. Someone in the chain of command had to\ntake responsibility. General Alexander tendered his resignation on\nJune 30, 2013. “I’m the director,” he said, falling on his sword. “Ultimately,\nI’m accountable.” Because President Obama did not want\nthe head of the NSA resigning in the midst of the Snowden crisis,\nhe asked him to stay on for another six months. He then appointed\nRogers to be his replacement. Meanwhile, it had become undeniably\nclear to the review committee appointed by President Obama in\n2013 that the NSA’s own defenses had catastrophically failed. If so,\nthis change was the equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs on the\nTitanic after it hit the iceberg.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 194\n9/29/16 5:51 PM\npart three\nTHE GAME OF NATIONS\nI learned that just beneath the surface there’s another world,\nand still different worlds as you dig deeper.\n—david lynch, on his 1986 film, Blue Velvet\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 195\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 196\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nc h a p t e r 19\nThe Rise of the NSA\nThere are many things we do in intelligence that, if revealed,\nwould have the potential for all kinds of blowback.\n— james clapper, director of national intelligence, 2013\nIn the game of nations, which often is not visible to public\nscrutiny, the great prize is state secrets that reveal the hidden\nweaknesses of a nation’s potential adversaries. The most important\nof these in peacetime is communication intercepts. It was just\nsuch state secrets that Edward Snowden took from the NSA in the\nspring of 2013. Before that breach, America’s paramount advantage\nin this subterranean competition was its undisputed dominance in\nthe business of obtaining and deciphering the communications of\nother nations. The NSA was the instrument by which the United\nStates both protected its own secret communications and stole the\nsecrets of foreign nations. The NSA, however, has an Achilles’s heel:\nIt is dependent on civilian computer technicians who do not necessarily\nshare its values to operate its complex system. Because of this\ndependence, it was not able in 2013, as it turned out, to protect its\ncrucial sources and methods.\nSnowden exposed this vulnerability when he walked away with\nthe aforementioned descriptions of the gaps in America’s coverage\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 197\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n198 | how america lost its secrets\nof the communications of its adversaries. Even though the Cold War\nhad been declared over after the collapse of the Soviet Union a quarter\nof a century earlier, the age- old enterprise of espionage did not\nend with it. Russia and China still sought to blunt the edge that the\nNSA gave the United States. The Snowden breach therefore needs to\nbe considered in the context of the once and future intelligence war.\nThe modern enterprise of reading the communications of other\nnations traces back in the United States to military code- breaking\nefforts preceding America’s entry into World War I. The invention\nof the radio at the end of the nineteenth century soon provided the\nmeans of rapidly sending and getting messages from ships, submarines,\nground forces, spies, and embassies. These over- the- air messages\ncould also be intercepted from the ether by adversaries. If they\nwere to remain secret, they could not be sent in plain text. They\nhad to be sent in either code, in which letters are substituted for one\nanother, or, more effectively, a cipher, in which numbers are substituted\nfor letters. Making and breaking codes and ciphers became\na crucial enterprise for nations. By 1914, the U.S. Army and Navy\nhad set up units, staffed by mathematicians, linguists, and crossword\npuzzle solvers, to intercept and decode enemy messages. After the\nwar had ended in 1918, these units were fused into a cover corporation\ncalled the Code Compilation Company, which moved to new\noffices on Thirty- Seventh Street and Madison Avenue in New York\nCity.\nUnder the supervision of the famous cryptographer Herbert O.\nYardley, a team of twenty code breakers was employed in what was\ncalled the Black Chamber. Yardley arranged for Western Union,\nwhich had the telegraph monopoly in America, to provide the Black\nChamber with all the telegrams coming into the United States. “Its\nfar- seeking eyes penetrate the secret conference chambers at Washington,\nTokyo, London, Paris, Geneva, Rome,” Yardley wrote about\nthe Black Chamber. “Its sensitive ears catch the faintest whispering\nin the foreign capitals of the world.” But in 1929, at the instructions\nof President Herbert Hoover, Secretary of State Henry Stimson\nclosed the Black Chamber, saying famously, “Gentlemen should not\nread each other’s mail.”\nThe moratorium did not last long. With war looming in Asia and\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 198\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Rise of the NSA | 199\nEurope, President Franklin D. Roosevelt reactivated the operation\nas the Signal Security Agency. It proved its value in breaking the\nJapanese machine- generated cipher “Purple.” In June 1942, using\ndeciphered Japanese messages to pinpoint the location of the Japanese\nfleet at Midway, America won a decisive naval victory in the\nPacific. Germany’s Enigma encoding machines, with three encoding\nwheels, proved more of a challenge. Initially, British cryptanalysts\nled by the brilliant mathematician Alan Turing succeeded in building\na rudimentary computer to decipher Germany’s messages to its\nsubmarines and bombers, but in 1942 Germany added a fourth set of\nencoding wheels, escalating what was essentially a battle of machine\nintelligence. The U.S. Navy then contracted with the National Cash\nRegister Company to build a computing machine capable of breaking\nthe improved Enigma, and in May 1943 it succeeded.\nBy the time the war ended in 1945, the United States had over\none hundred giant decryption machines in operation. This unrivaled\ncapability to read the communications of foreign nations, which\nremained one of America’s most closely guarded secrets, was transferred\nto the Army Security Agency based at Fort Meade, Maryland.\nThen, on October 24, 1952, President Harry S. Truman greatly\nexpanded its purview and changed its name to the National Security\nAgency.\nThe NSA was given two missions. The first one was protecting\nthe communications of the U.S. government. The main risk was that\nthe Soviets would find a way of breaching U.S. government channels\nof communications. The second mission was intercepting all the\nrelevant communications and signals of foreign governments. This\nlatter mandate included the governments of allies as well as enemies.\nThe president, the other intelligence services, and the Department\nof Defense deemed what was relevant for national security. Even\nthough the NSA remained part of the Department of Defense, its\njob went far beyond providing military intelligence. It also acted as\na service agency to other American intelligence services. They prepared\nshopping lists of foreign communications intelligence targets\nfor the NSA to pursue.\nAs the Cold War heated up in the 1960s, the NSA provided intelligence\nnot only to the Pentagon but to the Department of State, the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 199\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n200 | how america lost its secrets\nCentral Intelligence Agency, the Treasury Department, the Atomic\nEnergy Commission, and the FBI. With a multibillion- dollar “black\nbudget” hidden from public scrutiny, the NSA’s technology directorate\ninvested in state- of- the- art equipment, including supercomputers\nthat could break almost any cipher, antennas mounted on geosynchronous\nsatellites that vacuumed in billions of foreign telephone\ncalls, and other exotic capabilities. It also devised stealthy means of\nbreaking into channels that its adversaries believed were secure. This\nenterprise required not only an army of technical specialists capable\nof remotely intercepting even the faintest traces of electromagnetic\nsignals, hacking into computers, and eavesdropping on distant conversations\nbut also special units called “tailored access operations,”\nto plant listening devices in embassies and diplomatic pouches. The\nNSA also organized elaborate expeditions to give access to or even\npenetrate physical cables in enemy territory. In 1971, for example,\nthe NSA sent a specially equipped submarine into Russia’s Sea of\nOkhotsk in Asia to tap through Arctic ice. The target was a Russian\ncable four hundred feet below the surface that connected the Russian\nnaval headquarters in Vladivostok with a missile testing range.\nIn 1980, President Ronald Reagan gave the NSA a clear mandate\nto expand its interception of foreign communications. In Executive\nOrder 12333, he told the NSA that “all means, consistent with applicable\nFederal law and this [Executive] order, and with full consideration\nof the rights of United States persons, shall be used to obtain\nreliable intelligence information to protect the United States and its\ninterests.” It did not restrict any foreign country, either an adversary\nor an ally, from its surveillance.\nThe NSA’s target soon became nothing short of the entire electromagnetic\nspectrum. “We are approaching a time when we will\nbe able to survey almost any point on the earth’s surface with some\nsensor,” Admiral Stansfield Turner, the former director of central\nintelligence, wrote in 1985. “We should soon be able to keep track\nof most of the activities on the surface of the earth.” Bobby Ray\nInman, a former director of the NSA and deputy director of the CIA,\nargued that the “vastness of the [American] intelligence ‘take’ from\nthe Soviet Union, and the pattern of continuity going back years,\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 200\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Rise of the NSA | 201\neven decades,” greatly diminished the possibility of Soviet deception\nso long as the NSA kept secret its sources.\nThe NSA did not rely entirely on its own sensors for this global\nsurveillance. It also formed intelligence- sharing alliances with key\nallies. The most important was with the British code- breaking service,\nGCHQ, which had achieved enormous success in World War II\nin using computers to crack the German Enigma cipher. This alliance\nexpanded to include Canada, Australia, and New Zealand in the socalled\nFive Eyes Alliance. Because over 80 percent of international\nphone calls and Internet traffic passed through fiber- optic cables in\nthese five countries, the alliance had the capability of monitoring\nalmost all phone and Internet communications.\nThe NSA also established fruitful liaisons with the cyber services\nof Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Israel,\nJapan, and South Korea, which were often willing to provide the\nNSA with access to telecommunications links in their countries.\nThese long- term allies greatly strengthened the NSA’s hand in other\nways in the intelligence war. For example, the so- called James Bond\nprovision of the British Intelligence Services Act of 1994 allowed\nofficers of the GCHQ to commit illegal acts outside Britain, including\nplanting devices to intercept data from computer servers, cell\nphones, and other electronic targets. And, as Snowden’s release of\ndocuments revealed in 2013 and 2014, these foreign allies fully\nshared their information with the NSA.\nOf course, the liaison between the NSA and its allies was a twoway\nstreet. In 2013, none of these other countries had a global network\nof geosynchronous sensors in outer space and under the ocean\nthat could monitor signals from missile launching, submarines,\nmilitary deployments, nuclear tests, and other matters of strategic\nimportance to them. Nor did these allies have the cipher- breaking\ncapabilities of the array of NSA supercomputers. The NSA had\nassiduously built these means at a cost of over half a trillion dollars\nand employed tens of thousands of linguists who could translate\nalmost any dialect or language of interest.\nEven though these allies had their own cipher services and local\ncapabilities, they depended on the NSA to provide them with a large\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 201\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n202 | how america lost its secrets\nshare of their signals intelligence. From the perspective of defending\nthemselves from potential threats, the deal that these allies had with\nthe NSA was mutually advantageous.\nThe NSA’s overseas intelligence gathering was not limited to\nadversary nations. With the exception of the Five Eyes allies, it\ngathered data that was deemed important by the president and the\nDefense Department in friendly countries. These operations had\nbeen approved by every American president and funded by every\nAmerican Congress since 1941. After all, even in the realm of allies,\nactivities take place that run counter to American interests. The 9/11\nconspiracy, for example, was hatched in Hamburg, Germany, and\nfinanced in Dubai and Saudi Arabia.\nNor were American allies unaware of the reach of the NSA. “Yes,\nmy continental European friends, we have spied on you. And it is\ntrue we use computers to sort through data by using keywords,”\nthe former CIA director James Woolsey wrote in The Wall Street\nJournal in 2000. “Have you stopped to ask yourselves what we are\nlooking for?” Whether or not it was appreciated by other countries,\nthe global harvesting of communications intelligence by the NSA\nwas hardly a secret.\nAs the NSA expanded further, it delegated part of its work to\nregional bases, including ones in Utah, Texas, Hawaii, and Japan. The\nparamount task of the NSA remained monitoring the channels of\ncommunications that an adversary might use. The vast proliferation\nof these channels in cyberspace, which included e- mail, social\nmedia, document sharing, and other innovations of the Internet age,\ngreatly complicated this task. Even so, this challenge was not insurmountable,\nbecause most of the Internet actually traveled through\nfiberglass landline cables that crossed the territories of the United\nStates, Britain, and Australia. So the NSA found the technical means,\nincluding voluntarily gaining access to major Internet companies, to\n“harvest” vast amounts of this Internet data. America’s other intelligence\nagencies quickly recognized the value of the communications\nintelligence gleaned from foreign telecommunications. John E.\nMcLaughlin, who was the CIA’s acting director in 2004, described\nthe NSA as nothing less than the “very foundation of U.S. intelligence.”\nIt served as a “foundation” for the CIA because intercepted\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 202\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Rise of the NSA | 203\ncommunications intelligence allowed the CIA (and other U.S. intelligence\nservices) to test and verify the reports of their human sources\nin foreign countries. Moreover, because of the immense amount of\nforeign data that the NSA vacuumed in through its global sensors,\nit provided the CIA with an effective means for discovering new\ntargets in adversary nations.\nBy the first decade of this century, the NSA’s surreptitious efforts\nto render the Internet transparent to U.S. intelligence had earned it\na new set of enemies. They were the previously mentioned hacktivists\nwho were attempting to shield the activities of Internet users\nfrom the intrusions of government surveillance. They employed\nboth encryption and Tor software to defeat that surveillance. But the\nNSA did not conceal that it was intent on countering any attempt to\ninterfere with its surveillance of the Internet. It built back doors into\nencryption and worked to unravel the Tor scrambling of IP addresses.\nIt made leading hacktivists targets. Brian Hale, the spokesman for\nthe director of national intelligence, disclosed that the United States\nroutinely intercepted the cyber signatures of parties suspected of\nhacking into U.S. government networks.\nFollowing the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade\nCenter, the surveillance of the Internet became an integral part of\nthe Bush administration’s war on terrorism. In October 2001, Congress\nexpanded the NSA’s mandate by passing the USA Patriot Act.\nAs I described earlier, Section 215 of the act directly authorized\nthe NSA, with the approval of the FISA court, to collect and store\ndomestic telephone billing records. The idea was to better coordinate\ndomestic and foreign intelligence about al- Qaeda and other jihadist\ngroups. This put the NSA directly in the anti- terrorist business.\nIt also necessitated the NSA vastly increasing its coverage of the\nInternet.\nThe mantra in government in this post- 9/11 intelligence world\nbecame “connect the dots.” Congress through this act essentially\ndemolished the wall between domestic and foreign intelligence\nwhen any NSA activity related to foreign- directed terrorism. It further\nmade the NSA a partner with the FBI in tracking phone calls\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 203\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n204 | how america lost its secrets\nmade from phones originating outside the United States by known\nforeign jihadists. If these calls were made to individuals inside, the\nNSA was now authorized to retrieve the billing records of the person\ncalled and those people whom he or she called. These traces were\nthen supplied to the FBI. The new duties also increased the NSA’s\nneed to create new bureaucratic mechanisms to monitor its compliance\nwith FISA court orders. Rajesh De, the NSA’s general counsel at\nthe time of the Snowden breach, described the NSA as becoming by\n2013 “one of the most regulated enterprises in the world.” Grafted\nonto its intelligence activities were layers of mandated reporting to\noversight officials. Not only did the NSA have its own chief compliance\nofficer, chief privacy and civil liberties officer, and independent\ninspector general, but the NSA also had to report to a different set\nof compliance officers at the Department of Defense, the Office of\nthe Director of National Intelligence, and the Department of Justice.\nAdditionally, the Department of Justice dispatched a team of lawyers\nevery sixty days to review the results of “every single tasking decision”\napproved by the FISA court.\nAccording to De, just assembling these reports involved thousands\nof hours of manpower. In addition, the president’s Oversight Board\nrequired that the NSA’s Office of the General Counsel and inspector\ngeneral supply it every ninety days with a list of every single\nerror and deviation from procedure made by every NSA employee\nanywhere in the world, including even minor typing errors. These\nrequirements, according to De, inundated a large part of the NSA\nlegal and executive staff in a sea of red tape. Yet this regulation could\nnot undo surveillance programs such as the one Snowden revealed\nof Verizon’s turning over the billing records of its customers to the\nNSA, because the NSA was in compliance with the FISA court order\n(even though, as it turned out in 2015, the FISA court might have\nerred in interpreting the law).\nThe NSA’s focus on surveillance might have led to the neglect of\nits other mission: protecting the integrity of the channels through\nwhich the White House, government agencies, and military units\nsend information. This task had been made vastly more difficult\nby the proliferation of computer networks, texting, and e- mails.\nTo protect government networks from cyber attacks, the Penta-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 204\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Rise of the NSA | 205\ngon belatedly created the U.S. Cyber Command in 2009. In it, the\ncyber- defense units of the army, navy, marines, and air force cyber\nforces were merged together and put under the command of the\nNSA director. General Keith Alexander became the first director\nof this new command. One problem for the Cyber Command was\nseparating attacks by civilians, including criminals, hacktivists, and\nanarchists, from cyber warfare sponsored and supported by adversary\nstates. Because foreign intelligence services often closely imitated\nthe tools of civilian hackers, and were even known to provide\nthem with hacking tools, it was not easy for the Cyber Command\nto unambiguously determine if the ultimate perpetrator of a cyber\nattack was state sponsored. For example, the identification of North\nKorea as the principal actor behind the attack on Sony in December\n2014 appeared to be a rare success, but many cyber- security experts\nbelieved that it might be a false trail used to hide the real attacker.\nClues could be fabricated in cyberspace to point to the wrong party.\nThe job of the Cyber Command was to prevent such an attack. To\nthis end, it planted viruses on hundreds of thousands of computers\nin private hands to act as sentinels to spot other suspicious viruses\nthat could mount such an attack. Private computers had become\na new battleground in the cyber wars. It also built a capability to\nretaliate. Still, cyber attacks, which were launched through layers of\nother countries’ computers, could not be unambiguously traced back\nto the true perpetrator.\nThis escalation by the Cyber Command set the stage for expanded\nforms of warfare in cyberspace. “The Chinese are viewed as the\nsource of a great many attacks on western infrastructure and just\nrecently, the U.S. electrical grid,” General Alexander said in explaining\nthe need for this consolidation. “If that is determined to be an\norganized attack, I would want to go and take down the source of\nthose attacks.” The same retaliation would presumably be used\nagainst Russia, Iran, or any other adversary. Dominance of cyberspace\nitself now became part of the NSA’s mandate.\nEven so, the most important job of the NSA remained intercepting\nsecret information from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.\nTo this end, it had an annual budget of $12.3 billion and some thirtyfive\nthousand military and civilian employees. In 2013, James Clap-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 205\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n206 | how america lost its secrets\nper, director of national intelligence, justified the secret intelligence\nbudget by saying in an open session of Congress, “We are bolstering\nour support for clandestine SIGINT [signals intelligence] capabilities\nto collect against high priority targets, including foreign leadership\ntargets,” and to develop “groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities\nto defeat adversarial cryptography and exploit Internet traffic.” It\nwas no secret to Congress, even before Snowden, that the NSA was\nattempting to monitor the Internet. What was a closely held secret\nbefore Snowden revealed it was that the NSA had found a way in\n2007 to intercept Internet traffic before it was encrypted.\nThrough all this tumult, the heart of the NSA’s activity remained\nits five- thousand- acre base at Fort Meade, Maryland. It commanded\nthe most powerful mechanism for intercepting communications that\nthe world had ever seen. No other country came close to its technology\nfor intercepting information. The NSA not only was able to\nintercept secret information from potential adversaries but also— at\nleast until the Snowden breach— managed to conceal these means\nfrom them. As long as these adversaries remained blind to the ways\nin which their communications were being intercepted, deciphered,\nand read by the NSA, they could not take effective countermeasures.\nConsequently, the NSA had the capability to provide the president\nand his advisers with continuous insights into the thinking and\nplanning of potential enemies.\nKeeping its sources and methods secret was no easy task. The\nNSA’s technicians had to deal with continuous technical challenges\nto provide a seamless harvesting of data from a wide range of communication\ndevices, including telephones, computers, and the Internet.\nIt required continuous intra- agency communications between\nthe NSA’s own intelligence officers and a growing number of civilian\ntechnicians. It even had its own “Wiki- style” network through which\nthey could discuss problems, called the NSANet. Because it could\nnot tightly control access to this technical network, it expunged any\nmention of the sources and methods from the material circulated on\nthe classified NSA network. Instead, it stored them in discrete computers,\ncalled compartments, which were disconnected from other\ncomputers at the NSA. These compartments could only be accessed\nby a limited number of analysts and NSA executives who had a need\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 206\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Rise of the NSA | 207\nto know about the data they contained. These compartments were\nthe final line of defense against an inside intruder.\nIn 2009, Snowden, as we know, found his way into the NSA\nthrough a temporary job with an outside contractor that was working\nfor the NSA’s Technology Directorate to repair and update its\nbackup system. Four years later, by maneuvering to get hired by\nanother outside contractor with access to the NSA’s sources and\nmethods, he was able to steal secrets stored in isolated computers\nbearing directly on the ongoing intelligence war. Snowden also\ncopied from these compartments in a matter of weeks, as has been\npreviously mentioned, the NSA’s Level 3 sources and methods used\nagainst Russia, Iran, and China. The Snowden breach demonstrated\nthat the NSA’s envelope of secrecy was at best illusory.\nAfter this immense loss, the NSA’s sources inside these adversary\ncountries were largely compromised, even if they were not closed\ndown. Once these adversaries were in a position to know what channels\nthe NSA was intercepting, they could use these same channels\nto mislead U.S. intelligence. A former top intelligence official told\nme, “The queen on our chessboard had been taken.”\nThe NSA moved to mitigate the damage and find new ways of\nobtaining unexpected intelligence. In June 2014, the new NSA director,\nRogers, had to confront flagging morale that, according to General\nHayden, was near paralyzing the intelligence service. Rogers\nrecognized that as a direct result of the Snowden breach, “the nation\nhas lost capabilities against adversaries right now who are attempting\nto actively undermine us.” But even with that loss, he observed,\n“the sky has not fallen.”\nAs in the Chicken Little fable he cited, the world had not ended\nfor the NSA. Nor had it ended for the multibillion- dollar outsourcing\nenterprise it superintended. The NSA might have lost many\nof its sources, or “capabilities,” but Rogers held out hope that new\nsources could eventually be found to replace them. Compromised\ncodes, after all, could be changed. New technological methods could\nbe devised. New vulnerabilities could also be targeted in enemy territories.\nAlthough repairing the damage might take many “decades,”\naccording to Michael McConnell, the vice- chairman of Booz Allen,\nthe new director had to get on with that task. McConnell, a for-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 207\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n208 | how america lost its secrets\nmer NSA director himself, pointed out that the NSA director’s “first\nresponsibility is to be the chief cheerleader.” Rebuilding the NSA\ncapabilities assumed, however, that there would not be another\nSnowden- sized breach.\nThe question remained: How could the NSA’s vaunted secrecy\nhave been so deeply penetrated by a mere analyst in training at a\nregional base in Oahu? The perpetrator himself could not be asked if\nhe was in Moscow pointing to the “incompetence” of the NSA in his\nMoscow interviews. What was known, though, was that the young\nman who had taken the “queen” from the board had gained entry to\nthe NSA’s secret chambers through the back door, a portal opened to\nhim by the NSA’s reliance on outside contractors.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 208\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nc h a p t e r 20\nThe NSA’s Back Door\nYou have private for- profit companies doing inherently governmental\nwork like targeted espionage, surveillance, compromising\nforeign systems. And there’s very little oversight, there’s very\nlittle review.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2014\nPrior to snowden’s theft of NSA documents, the single most\nshattering blow to the confidence of the U.S. intelligence community\nwas the 1994 exposure of Aldrich Ames as a long- serving\nRussian mole in the CIA. Ames, it will be recalled, had been a highranking\nCIA officer, working at the CIA’s Counterintelligence Center\nAnalysis Group, before he was arrested by the FBI. He had also\nworked as a mole for Russian intelligence.\nIn a plea bargain to avoid a death sentence (he was sentenced to\nlife imprisonment), he admitted that he had successfully burrowed\ninto the CIA and had worked there for over nine years on behalf of\nthe KGB. His description of his sub- rosa activities as a mole was part\nof the plea bargain. This stunning revelation shook the CIA leadership\nto its core. Until then, CIA executives steadfastly denied that it\nwas possible that the KGB could sustain a mole in American intelligence.\nThe Ames arrest also led the NSA to reassess its own vulnerability\nto penetration. Could there be an Ames inside the NSA?\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 209\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n210 | how america lost its secrets\nThe question was considered by the NSA’s National Threat Operations\nCenter, the same unit from which Edward Snowden later\nstole a huge trove of secret documents. According to a report in 1996\ntitled “Out of Control” (later released by the NSA), the danger of\nan Ames- type penetration could not be excluded. Even though the\n“threat officer” who wrote this report was not identified by name,\nhis analysis proved incredibly prescient. He said that the NSA’s drive\nto enhance its performance by networking its computers would\nresult in the intelligence services’ putting “all their classified information\n‘eggs’ into one very precarious basket.” The basket was the\ncomputer networks run by technicians called system administrators.\nHe pointed out that the NSA was becoming increasingly dependent\non such networked computer systems, and he predicted that the\nNSA’s “Aldrich Ames,” as he put it, would be a “system administrator,”\nwhich was the position that Edward Snowden held nearly two\ndecades later at Dell when he began stealing secrets.\nThe NSA’s system administrators were, as the threat officer\npointed out, very different from the traditional military employees\nat the NSA. They were usually civilians who effectively served as\nrepairmen for complex computer systems. Moreover, many of them\nhad not been directly hired by the NSA. Instead, their recruitment\nhad been privatized to outside contractors.\nThis outsourcing had deep roots tracing back to World War II. Ed\nBooz and Jim Allen, the founders of Booz Allen Hamilton, obtained\ncontracts to help manage ship construction from the U.S. Navy.\nAfter the war ended, they sought contracts for their firm in classified\nwork. These contracts grew in size as the NSA needed more\nand more system administrators and other information technologists\nto manage the computer networks. These system administrators\nneeded to be given special privileges to do their service job. One\nsuch privilege allowed them to bypass password protection. Another\nprivilege allowed then to temporarily transfer data to an external\nstorage device while they repaired computers. These two privileges\ngreatly increased the risk of a massive breach. Seeing them as the\nweak link in the chain, the threat officer wrote in the report that\n“system administrators are likely to be increasingly targeted by for-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 210\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe NSA’s Back Door | 211\neign intelligence services because of their special access to information.”\nBefore the computerization of the NSA, the threat officer noted,\ncode clerks and other low- level NSA communicators had been the\ntargets of adversary intelligence services. But the increasing reliance\non computer technicians presented foreign intelligence services\nwith much richer targets. He predicted that they would adapt their\nrecruiting to this new reality. Specifically, he argued that adversary\nintelligence services would now focus their attention on system\nadministrators. “With system administrators,” he said, “the situation\nis potentially much worse than it has ever been with communicators.”\nThe reason, he explained, was that “system administrators\ncan so easily, and quickly, steal vast quantities of information.”\nHe further suggested that because system administrators are\noften drawn from the counterculture of hacking, they are more\nlikely to be vulnerable to an adversary service using a fake identity\nfor its approach, or a “false flag.” A “false flag” was a term originally\napplied to a pirate ship that temporarily hoisted any flag that would\nallow it to gain proximity to its intended prey, but in modern times\nit describes a technique employed by espionage services to surreptitiously\nlure a prospect. False flags were a staple used by the KGB\nin espionage recruitment during the Cold War. They were usually\nemployed when a target for recruitment was not ideologically disposed\nto assisting the intelligence service. To overcome that problem,\nrecruiters hide their true identities and adopt a more sympathetic,\nbogus one.\nIn 1973, the KGB, working through one of its agents in the U.S.\nNavy, used the false flag of Israel to recruit Jerry Alfred Whitworth,\nwho served as a communications officer with a top secret clearance\nfor the navy. Like many other KGB recruits, Whitworth came from\na broken family, dropped out of high school, took technical courses,\nand got a job as a communications officer. He was not disposed to\nworking for Russia. But he was willing to steal enciphered and\nplain text cables to help in the defense of Israel. After he was thoroughly\ncompromised by his espionage work, he was told by the KGB\nrecruiter that he was actually working for Russia, but by this time\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 211\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n212 | how america lost its secrets\nhe was too deeply compromised to quit. He continued his espionage\nwork for another eight years. (Whitworth, who was arrested by the\nFBI in 1985, was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 365 years\nin prison.)\nThe Internet provided an almost ideal environment for false flags\nbecause its users commonly adopt aliases, screen names, and other\navatars. The threat officer explained how easy it would be for the\nKGB to adapt such a false flag when dealing with a dissident system\nadministrator working for U.S. intelligence. As the threat officer\npointed out in his report, the KGB had used false flags in the late\n1980s to surreptitiously recruit members of the “German Hanover\nHackers,” a community of anarchistic hackers who breached computer\nnetworks for fun and profit. Until then, these hacktivists stole\ncorporate and private passwords, credit card information, and other\nprivileged documents as a form of freelance espionage. Because of\ntheir fervent anti- authority ideology, the KGB disguised its recruiters\nas fellow hacktivists. The KGB succeeded in getting the Hanover\nhackers to steal log- in account identifications, source codes, and other\ninformation from U.S. government computer networks.\nThe weak link of system administrators became increasingly relevant\nas the NSA moved further into the digital age. By the beginning\nof this century, its growing networks of computers were largely\noperated by civilian technicians, including system administrators,\ninfrastructure analysts, and information technologists, who were\nneeded to keep the system running. Despite the warning by the\nthreat officer, the NSA became more and more reliant on these outsiders\nas it reorganized to meet its new mandates for surveillance of\nthe Internet in the war on terrorism.\nThe NSA had to compete with technology companies, such as\nGoogle, Apple, and Facebook, for the services of experienced IT\nworkers. Though Booz Allen had been providing technically trained\nspecialists to the government since the 1940s and ’50s, congressionally\nimposed salary caps put the NSA at a disadvantage to private\nfirms in its recruitment efforts. As a result, it increasingly contracted\nwith private firms to find talent, especially in the rush for data-based\nintelligence following 9/11. Booz Allen, to meet increased demand,\nrecruited civilian technicians from many unconventional areas,\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 212\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe NSA’s Back Door | 213\nincluding the hacking culture. Ex- hackers who lacked (or shunned)\nemployment opportunities in the corporate sector were suitable\ncandidates for the system administrator jobs that these firms had\ncontracted to supply the NSA. In the rush to expand, little heed was\npaid to the 1996 warning that this hacking culture might provide\na portal to anti- government hacktivist groups. The NSA became\nso enamored with this new computer technology that it neglected\nthe security implications of employing outsiders to service it. “All\nof us just fell in love with the ease and convenience and scale [of\nelectronic storage],” General Hayden, who headed the NSA at the\ntime, said to The Wall Street Journal in 2015. “So we decided to take\nthings we used to keep if not in a safe, at least in our desk drawer,\nand put it up here [in a computer network], where it’s by definition\nmore vulnerable.” Making matters even worse, as has previously\nbeen discussed, the NSA stripped away much of the so- called stovepiping\nthat insulated highly sensitive data from the NSA’s other\ncomputer networks. FBI Director Mueller, in his “Statement Before\nthe Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental\nAffairs,”described a decade of post–9/11 intelligence reorganization\nthus: “One of the first steps was to centralize control and management\nof counterterrorism operations at headquarters to avoid the\n‘stove-piping’ of information on terrorism cases in the 56 individual\nfield offices across the country.” Here the NSA was merely following\nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission to make their data\nmore accessible to other agencies concerned with potential terrorist\nattacks, but as a result, the inner sanctum of the NSA became more\nopen to its new army of civilian technicians.\nBy 2013, much of the job of managing the NSA’s classified computers\nhad been handed over to a handful of private companies: Booz\nAllen Hamilton, which handled the most highly secret work; Dell\nSecureWorks; Microsoft; Raytheon; and IBM. In many respects,\nthese five companies acted less like management consultants and\nmore like temporary employment agencies in finding for the NSA\nthe computer specialists who had the necessary security clearances.\nThe NSA found that the universe of independent contractors was\ngoverned by very different considerations from that of intelligence\nservices. Unlike intelligence services, their fate depended on turning\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 213\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n214 | how america lost its secrets\nprofits. Because the value of their contracts was largely limited by\ncompetitive bidding, their business plans were predicated on their\nability to minimize the costs of fulfilling these contracts. Their principal\ncost was the salaries they paid their independent contractors.\nTheir business plans therefore depended on finding large numbers\nof computer technicians in the private realm willing to work at an\nNSA base at relatively low wages. This task became more difficult as\nmany potential recruits could find higher- paying employment with\nmore of a future in the burgeoning private sphere. But the companies\ncould also increase their revenue streams by getting additional\ncontracts, which, in turn, meant recruiting even more workers.\nSuch a business plan could hardly afford to give the highest priority\nto the low probability of a security risk. In the private sector,\nthere is usually an unambiguous external measure of failure. An\nautomobile company such as General Motors can measure the performance\nof its executives by reckoning its change in net income.\nWith secret intelligence work, the metrics for failure are far less\nclear. This curious aspect of secret work was part of the advice given\nto a White House lawyer in the Obama administration seeking a\nposition with the NSA in 2012, who was told that among the advantages\nof working for a super-secret agency was that if one errs or\nhas a failure, “it stays secret.” The Snowden case showed that not all\nfailures stay secret.\nThe NSA can certainly quantify the amount of data it is intercepting,\nbut it obviously cannot count the intelligence that it misses. The\na priori proposition in the intelligence game is that “what is successfully\nhidden is never found.” But one failure that cannot be hidden\nis a security breach in which a perpetrator uses NSA data to publicly\nexpose the NSA’s sources.\nUntil the Snowden breach in 2013, the NSA had experienced only\none such public failure. It was the capture by North Korea in 1968 of\nthe USS Pueblo, which had been carrying out highly sensitive electronic\ncommunications interception for the NSA. The Pueblo crew\nfailed to destroy the NSA’s encoding machines, which were flown\nto Russia several days later. It was a horrible, costly breach. The\nSnowden breach was much worse because, among the thousands of\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 214\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe NSA’s Back Door | 215\ndocuments he stole, he selected lists of the NSA’s secret sources in\nadversary nations.\nThe Snowden breach was a failure that directly traced back to the\nNSA’s largest and most trusted contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton,\ncalling into question the vexing issue of privatizing secret intelligence.\nBooz Allen, like other private firms that did work for the government,\nwas in the business to make money. Indeed, it had found\ngovernment contracts so much more profitable than its work in\nthe private sector that it sold its private sector unit to Price Waterhouse.\nThe profitability of government work led the Carlyle Group’s\nprivate equity fund to acquire a controlling stake in Booz Allen in\nJuly 2008. By 2013, it had increased its revenue by more than $1.3\nbillion by expanding its government contracts. Even more impressive,\nits operating profit on these contracts had doubled. It did not\nneed to increase its core internal staff to achieve these profits, it just\nhad to hire outside contractors. In 2008, Booz Allen claimed 20,000\nemployees on its internal staff; in 2013, it claimed fewer than 5,000.\nThe resulting “reduced headcount,” according to its January 30,\n2013, quarterly report, greatly decreased its costs for incentive pay.\nIt mainly accomplished this reduction by expanding the number of\noutside contractors it employed, 8,000 in these five years, by one\nWall Street analyst’s calculation. They were employed as system\nadministrators, infrastructure analysts, computer security specialists,\nand other “geek squad” jobs at the NSA and other government\nagencies. Their main qualification was their prior security clearances\n(which as mentioned earlier saved Booz Allen the expense of vetting\nthem and also the loss of income while waiting many months for a\nclearance).\nSnowden therefore was highly desirable for Booz Allen from an\neconomic point of view. Even though he had no prior experience as\nan infrastructure analyst, and he had been detected being untruthful\nabout his degree in computer sciences, he not only had a SCI security\nclearance but was willing to take a cut in pay. In keeping with\nthe Booz Allen business plan, such a recruit provided another cog in\nits profit machine.\nNot only had the NSA outsourced much of its computer opera-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 215\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n216 | how america lost its secrets\ntions to private companies, but the Clinton administration in 1996\nhad privatized background checks for government employees\nrequiring security clearances. The idea, backed by Vice President\nAl Gore, was to reduce the size of the federal government by outsourcing\ninvestigating the backgrounds of millions of government\napplicants for jobs. The task had previously been performed by the\nFBI, but it was assumed that a profit- making business could do it\nfaster and more efficiently. The private company named U.S. Investigations\nServices was purchased in 2007 for $1.5 billion by Providence\nEquity Partners, a rapidly expanding investment firm founded\nin 1989 by graduates of Duke, Brown University, and the Harvard\nBusiness School. So like Booz Allen, USIS was backed by a hedge\nfund determined to make money by systematically cutting the cost\nof a service previously carried out by the government.\nBut such outsourcing had drawbacks. For one thing, unlike the\nFBI, USIS lacked the investigative clout to gain entry to certain government\nagencies. A Congressional review found that the privacy\nact permits disclosure of government agency records to the private\nfirm if they are part of a “routine use of the records,” but intelligence\nagencies did not consider all such requests to be “routine. For example,\nwhen it did the background check on Snowden in 2011, it could\nnot get access to his CIA file. The “derog” in his file might have set\noff alarm bells, as might the fear that he had been threatened by an\ninternal investigation over his alleged computer tampering in 2009.\nThe FBI might have learned this about Snowden if it had done his\nbackground check.\nThe lack of adequate oversight was another problem. USIS closed\ncases and cleared applicants without completing an adequate investigation.\nAccording to a U.S. government suit filed in 2014, USIS\nhad prematurely closed over 665,000 investigations in order to get\npaid for them more quickly. Because the more cases it completed\neach month, the more money it received from the government, the\nlawsuit alleged that USIS employees often “flushed” or ended cases\nbefore completing a full investigation to meet corporate- imposed\nquotas for getting bonuses. One employee, in an e- mail cited in the\ngovernment’s complaint, said they “flushed everything like a dead\ngoldfish.” As a result, some information specialists entering the NSA\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 216\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe NSA’s Back Door | 217\nthrough the back door of outside contractors were not fully vetted.\n(On August 20, 2015, USIS agreed to forfeit $30 million in fees to\nsettle the lawsuit.)\nUSIS was also open to sophisticated hacking attacks by outsiders.\nIn August 2014, the Department of Homeland Security’s counterintelligence\nunit discovered such a massive and persistent breach\nin USIS that it shut down its entire exchange of data with it. The\nintrusion into USIS records in this case was attributed to hackers in\nChina most likely linked to the Chinese intelligence service. Such\nmassive intrusions dated back to 2011. USIS’s lack of security in its\nwebsite left a gaping hole through which outside parties, including\nChinese and Russian hackers, could learn both the identity and the\nbackground information of specialists applying for jobs at the NSA.\nThese private companies also did not sufficiently protect the personal\ndata of their independent contractors working at the NSA.\nThe hackers’ group Anonymous took credit for the successful 2011\nattack on the Booz Allen Hamilton servers. It also cracked the algorithms\nused to protect employees. It next injected so- called Trojan\nhorse viruses and other malicious codes into Booz Allen servers\nthat allowed it future entry. If amateur hackers such as Anonymous\ncould break into the computers of the NSA’s largest contractor, so\ncould adversaries’ state espionage services with far more advanced\nhacking tools. From these sites, China or Russia could obtain all the\njob applications and personal résumés submitted to contractors such\nas Booz Allen. It could then compile a list of the best candidates to\ndo its bidding.\nThese deficiencies in the private sector were compounded by\nthe failure of security in the government’s own Office of Personnel\nManagement. It used a computer system called e- QIP in which\nintelligence employees, including outside contractors, updated their\ncomputerized records to maintain or upgrade their security clearances.\nFor example, Snowden updated his clearance in 2011. To do\nso, these employees constantly updated their financial and personal\ninformation. As it turned out, there was a major hole in the e- QIP\nsystem. It has repeatedly been hacked by unknown parties since\n2010. In 2015, the U.S. government told Congress that China was\nmost likely responsible, but Russia and other nations with sophis-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 217\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n218 | how america lost its secrets\nticated cyber services could have also participated in the hacking. In\nany case, the records of over nineteen million employees, including\nintelligence workers, became available to a hostile intelligence service.\nThis breach would allow hostile services to obtain a great deal\nof information about independent contractors working at the NSA.\nThey could then use this data to follow the movements of any of\nthese intelligence workers they deemed of interest.\nDespite all the potential flaws in it, the outsourcing system continued\nin place. It even featured a revolving door through which Booz\nAllen hired retiring executives from the intelligence services, such\nas the former NSA director Michael McConnell; James Woolsey, a\nformer director of the CIA; and the retired general James Clapper,\nwho later served as director of national intelligence.\nThe cozy relationship between the private firms and the NSA\nnotwithstanding, the NSA leadership operated as if it were unaware\nthat outsourcing could create a security problem. As far back as\n2005 General Hayden, then the departing head of the NSA, had\nbeen warned of one such vulnerability in a memorandum written\nby a counterintelligence officer at the NSA. Like the earlier 1996\nreport by the threat officer, this memorandum noted the NSA had\nceded responsibility for managing its secret systems to outsiders and\nwarned that the NSA’s reliance on them to manage its computers\nhad opened a back door into the NSA. In addition, it warned that\nonce an outside contractor managed to slip in through this back door,\nhe could easily jump from one outsourcer to another. This was what\nSnowden did when he moved from Dell to Booz Allen Hamilton in\n2013.\nDespite its security flaws, outsourcing seemed to provide a number\nof advantages to the NSA. For one thing, it provided a means for\ncircumventing the budget restrictions imposed by Congress on hiring\nnew employees. In addition, because private companies had less\nrigid hiring standards, it greatly expanded the pool of young system\nadministrators by tapping into computer cultures that would be\nantagonistic to working directly for the government. Finally, it drew\nless on NSA resources. Because these information technologists\nwere only temporary employees, they were not entitled to military\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 218\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe NSA’s Back Door | 219\npensions, paid medical leave, and other benefits. It was a system that\neffectively replaced military careerists with freelancers.\nThe irony of the situation was that the NSA had surrounded its\nfront doors with rings of barbed wire, closed- circuit cameras, and\narmed guards, but for reasons of economy, bureaucratic restrictions,\nand convenience it had left the back door of outsourcing open to\ntemporary employees of private companies, even though it might\ntake some time for them to gain entry to its inner sanctum.\n“It was not a question of if but when one of the contractors would\ngo rogue,” the former NSA executive who wrote the 2015 memorandum\ntold me. Snowden answered that question in 2013. Even more\nextraordinary than the theft itself was the reaction to it by the NSA.\nIt turned out that there was no cost of failure levied against the outside\ncontractor Booz Allen, which had employed Snowden when he\nbypassed its security regime to steal the keys to the kingdom. Even\nthough the counterintelligence investigation showed Snowden stole\ndocuments from compartments to which he did not have access, the\nNSA did not penalize Booz Allen. Instead, its revenues and profits\nfrom government contracts markedly increased between 2013 and\n2015.\nNor did the NSA alter its reliance on private contractors. The back\ndoor to the NSA remained wide open. Outsourcing to private companies\nhas become an all but irreplaceable part of the intelligence\nsystem in America, Snowden’s actions, and the risk of future similar\nactions, notwithstanding.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 219\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nc h a p t e r 21\nThe Russians Are Coming\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster\nof the century.\n— vladimir putin\nIn the first invasion of a European country since the end of\nthe Cold War, Russian military forces moved into the Crimea and\nother parts of eastern Ukraine in February and March 2014. Unlike\nwith previous Russian troop movements, such as those into Poland,\nHungary, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany during the Cold War,\nthe weeklong massing of Russian elite troops and sophisticated\nequipment for the move into Ukraine almost totally evaded detection\nby the NSA’s surveillance. Never before had the NSA’s multibilliondollar\narmada of sensors and other apparatus for intercepting signals\nmissed such a massive military operation. According to a report in\nThe Wall Street Journal that cited Pentagon sources, Russian units\nhad managed to hide all electronic traces of their elaborate preparations.\nIf so, after more than half a century of attempted penetrations,\nRussia had apparently found a means of stymieing the interception\ncapabilities of the NSA.\nPutin had firm ideas about restoring Russia’s power in the post–\nCold War era. A formidable KGB officer before he became president\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 220\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Russians Are Coming | 221\nof the Russian Federation in 2000, he made no secret that his goal\nwas to prevent the United States from obtaining what he termed\n“global hegemony.” His logic was clear. He judged the breakup of\nthe Soviet Union in 1991 to be, as he put it, “a geopolitical disaster.”\nHe argued that the breakup had provided the United States with the\nmeans to become the singular dominant power in the world.\nHe sought to prevent that outcome by moving aggressively to\nredress this loss of Russian power. He upgraded Russia’s nuclear\nforce, modernized Russia’s elite military units, and greatly strengthened\nRussia’s relations with China. The last measure was essential\nbecause China was Russia’s principal ally in opposing the extension\nof American dominance. Yet there was still an immense gap between\nthem and the United States in communications intelligence.\nSince the breakup of the Soviet Union, the NSA had continued to\nbuild up its technological capabilities, while Russia teetered on the\nedge of collapse in the early 1990s. But as previously mentioned,\nthe NSA’s legal mandate had been limited by Congress to foreign\ninterceptions (at least prior to 9/11). As a result, it was required to\nseparate out domestic from foreign surveillance, a massive process\nthat not only was time- consuming but could generate dissidence\nwithin the ranks of American intelligence. It also could not legally\nuse its surveillance machinery to monitor the telephones and Internet\nactivities of the tens of thousands of civilian contractors who ran\nits computer networks— at least not unless the FBI began an investigation\ninto them.\nHere the Russian intelligence services had a clear advantage. They\nhad a lawful mandate to intercept any and all domestic communications.\nIn fact, a compulsory surveillance system called by its Russian\nacronym SORM had been incorporated into Russian law in 1995.\nIt requires the FSB and seven other Russian security agencies to\nmonitor all forms of domestic communications including telephones\n(SORM- 1), e- mails and other Internet activity (SORM- 2), and computer\ndata storage of billing information (SORM- 3). Not only did\nRussia run a nationwide system of Internet filtering in 2013, but it\nrequired its telecommunication companies to furnish it with worldwide\ndata.\nThe NSA also had to deal with many peripheral issues other than\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 221\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n222 | how america lost its secrets\nthe activities of Russia and China. It was charged with monitoring\nnuclear proliferation in Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea, potential\njihadist threats everywhere in the world, and much else. The\nRussian foreign intelligence service, the SVR, could put its limited\nresources to work on redressing the gap with its main enemy: the\nUnited States.\nNevertheless, Putin had to reckon with the reality in 2013 that\nRussia could not compete with the NSA in the business of intercepting\ncommunications. And if the NSA could listen in on all the\ninternal activities of its spy agencies and security regime, the ability\nof Putin to use covert means to achieve his other global ambitions\nwould be impaired. In the cold peace that replaced the Cold War,\nRussia had little hope of realizing these ambitions unless it could\nweaken the NSA’s iron- tight grip on global communications intelligence.\nOne way to remedy the imbalance between Russian intelligence\nand the NSA was via espionage. Here the SVR would be the\ninstrument, and the immediate objective would be to acquire the\nNSA’s lists of its sources in Russia. If successful, it would be a game\nchanger.\nSuch an ambitious penetration of the NSA, to be sure, was a tall\norder for Russian intelligence. Most of its moles recruited in the\nNSA by the KGB had been code clerks, guards, translators, and lowlevel\nanalysts. They provided documents about the NSA’s cipher\nbreaking, but they lacked access to the lists of the NSA’s sources and\nmethods. These meager results did not inhibit Russian efforts. For\nsix decades, ever since the inception of the NSA in 1952, the Russian\nintelligence service had engaged in a covert war with the NSA.\nThe Russian intelligence service is, as far as is known, the only\nintelligence service in the world that ever succeeded in penetrating\nthe NSA. A number of NSA employees also defected to Moscow.\nThe history of this venerable enterprise is instructive.\nThe first two defectors in the NSA’s history were William Martin\nand Bernon Mitchell. They were mathematicians working on the\nNSA’s decryption machines who went to Moscow via Cuba in 1960.\nThe Russian intelligence service, then called the KGB, went to great\nlengths to get propaganda value from their defections. It even organized\na ninety- minute press conference for them on September 6,\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 222\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Russians Are Coming | 223\n1960, at the Hall of Journalists and invited all the foreign correspondents\nin Moscow. Before television cameras, the defectors denounced\nthe NSA’s activities. Martin told how the NSA breached international\nlaws by spying on Germany, Britain, and other NATO allies.\nMitchell, for his part, suggested that the NSA’s practice of breaking\ninternational laws could ignite a nuclear war. Indeed, he justified\ntheir joint defection to Russia in heroic whistle- blowing terms,\nsaying, “We would attempt to crawl to the moon if we thought it\nwould lessen the threat of an atomic war.” The NSA review of the\ncase, however, assessed that little damage had been done, because the\nNSA quickly changed the codes they had compromised. It noted,\n“The Communist spymasters would undoubtedly have preferred\nMartin and Mitchell to remain in place as moles, since their information\nwas dated as of the moment they left NSA.”\nThe next NSA defector was Victor Norris Hamilton, a translator\nand analyst at the NSA. He arrived in Moscow in 1962, and like\nMitchell and Martin he claimed the status of a whistle- blower. This\ntime, the KGB provided a newspaper platform. Writing in the Russian\nnewspaper Izvestia, Hamilton revealed the extent of U.S. spying\non its allies in the Middle East.\nNone of these three 1960s defectors revealed what, if any, NSA\nsecret documents they had compromised. Nor did any of them ever\nreturn to the United States. Martin changed his name to Vladimir\nSokolodsky, married a Russian woman, and died in Mexico City on\nJanuary 17, 1987. Mitchell vanished from sight and was reported to\nhave died in St. Petersburg on November 12, 2001. Hamilton, after\ntelling Russian authorities stories about hearing voices in his head\nbecause of an NSA device implanted in his brain, was consigned to\nSpecial Psychiatric Hospital No. 5 outside Moscow.\nThere were also KGB spies in the NSA who were caught or died\nbefore they could defect. One of them was Sergeant Jack Dunlap.\nHe was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage on\nJuly 23, 1963. Although there was no suicide note, his death was\nruled an apparent suicide. NSA classified documents were later discovered\nin his house. After that, NSA investigators unraveled his\ndecade- long career as a KGB mole. Dunlap had been recruited by the\nKGB in Turkey in 1952. The standard KGB tool kit for recruitment\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 223\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n224 | how america lost its secrets\nwas called MICE. It stood for Money, Ideology, Compromise, and\nEgo. The KGB used the first element, money, to compromise Dunlap.\nAfter he was compromised, it exploited him by getting him to steal\nNSA secrets. He had access to such secrets because he became the\npersonal driver to Major General Garrison Coverdale, the chief of\nstaff of the NSA. After Coverdale retired, he became the driver for\nhis successor, General Thomas Watlington. These positions afforded\nhim a security clearance and, even more important, a “no inspection”\nstatus for the commanding general’s cars that he drove. This\nperk allowed him to leave the base with secret documents, have them\nphotocopied by his KGB case officer, and then return them to the files\nat the NSA base before anyone else knew they were missing. He also\nused, likely at the suggestion of the KGB case officers, his “no inspection”\nperk to offer other NSA employees a way of earning money.\nHe would smuggle off the base any items of government property\nthat they took. Once he had compromised them through thefts, he\nwas in a position to ask them for intelligence favors. This NSA ring\ncould not be fully investigated because of his untimely death. Other\nthan the packets of undelivered NSA documents found in his home,\nthe investigation was never able to assess the total extent of the KGB\npenetration of NSA secrets. (Angleton suspected Dunlap was murdered\nby the KGB in what he termed a surreptitiously assisted death,\nto prevent Dunlap from talking to investigators.)\nThe Russian intelligence services continued recruiting mercenary\nspies in the NSA for the duration of the Cold War. The KGB successes\nincluded Robert Lipka, a clerk at the NSA in the mid- 1960s,\nwho was caught in a sting operation by the FBI and sentenced to\neighteen years in a federal prison. Ronald Pelton, an NSA analyst,\nwas recruited after he retired from the NSA. After he was betrayed\nby a KGB double agent in 1985, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.\nFinally, there was David Sheldon Boone, an NSA code clerk,\nwho between 1988 and 1992 provided the KGB with NSA documents\nin return for $60,000. Boone, sentenced to twenty- four years\nin prison, was the last known KGB recruitment of the Cold War.\nDuring the Cold War, Russian intelligence service officers operated\nmainly under the cover of the embassies, consulates, United\nNations delegations, and other diplomatic missions of the Soviet\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 224\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Russians Are Coming | 225\nUnion. As “diplomats,” they were protected from arrest by the terms\nof the 1961 Treaty of Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\nTheir diplomatic cover, however, greatly limited their field for finding\npotential recruits outside their universe of international meetings,\ndiplomatic receptions, UN organizations, scientific conferences,\nand cultural exchanges. They therefore tended to recruit their counterparts\nin adversary services.\nIn this regard, the successful entrapment of Harold Nicholson\nin the 1990s is highly instructive. From his impressive record, he\nseemed an unlikely candidate for recruitment. He had been a superpatriotic\nAmerican who had served as a captain in army intelligence\nbefore joining the CIA in 1980. In the CIA, he had an unblemished\nrecord as a career officer, serving as a station chief in Eastern\nEurope and then the deputy chief of operations in Malaysia in 1992.\nEven though his career was on the rise and he was a dedicated anti-\nCommunist, he became a target for the SVR when he was assigned\nto the CIA’s elite Russian division. Because the job of this division\nwas to recruit Russian officials working abroad as diplomats, engineers,\nand military officers, its operations brought its officers in close\ncontact with SVR officers. Nicholson therefore was required to meet\nwith Russian intelligence officers in Manila, Bucharest, Tokyo, and\nBangkok and “dangle” himself to the SVR by feigning disloyalty to\nthe CIA.\nAs part of these deception operations, Nicholson supplied the\nRussians with tidbits of CIA secrets, or “chickenfeed,” that had been\napproved by his superiors at the CIA. What his CIA superiors did\nnot fully take into account in this spy- versus- spy game was the\nSVR’s ability to manipulate, compromise, and convert a “dangle” to\nits own ends. As it turned out, Russian intelligence had been assembling\na psychological profile on Nicholson since the late 1980s and\nfound vulnerability: his resentment at the failure of his superiors\nto recognize his achievements in intelligence. The Russians played\non this vulnerability to compromise him and then converted him to\nbecoming its mole inside the CIA.\nNicholson worked for the SVR first in Asia; then he was given a\nmanagement position at CIA headquarters, which is located in Langley,\nVirginia. Among other secret documents, he provided the SVR\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 225\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n226 | how america lost its secrets\nwith the identities of CIA officers sent to the CIA’s special training\nschool at Fort Peary, Virginia, which opened the door for the SVR to\nmake other potential recruitments. Meanwhile, it paid him $300,000\nbefore he was finally arrested by the FBI in November 1996. (After\nhis conviction for espionage, he was sentenced to twenty- three years\nin federal prison.) The CIA postmortem on Nicholson, who was the\nhighest- ranking CIA officer ever recruited (as far as is known), made\nclear that even a loyal American, with no intention of betraying the\nUnited States, could be entrapped in the spy game.\nWhen it comes to recruiting moles in a larger universe, intelligence\nservices operate much like highly specialized corporate “headhunters,”\nas James Jesus Angleton described the process to me during\nthe Cold War era. He was referring to the similar approach that corporate\nhuman resource divisions had with espionage agencies. Both\nheadhunt by searching through a database of candidates for possible\nrecruits to fill specific positions. Both types of organizations have\nresearchers at their disposal to draw up rosters of potential recruits.\nBoth sort through available databases to determine which of the\nnames on the list have attributes that might qualify or disqualify\nthem for a recruitment pitch. Both also collect personal data on each\nqualified candidate, including any indication of his or her ideological\nleaning, political affiliations, financial standing, ambitions, and vanities,\nto help them make a tempting offer.\nBut there are two important differences. First, unlike their counterparts\nin the private sector, espionage headhunters ask their\ncandidates not only to take on a new job but also to keep their\nemployment secret from their present employer. Second, they ask\nthem to surreptitiously steal documents from him. Because they are\nasking candidates to break the law, espionage services, unlike their\ncorporate counterparts in headhunting, obviously need to initially\nhide from the candidates the dangerous nature of the work they will\ndo. Depending on the targeted recruit, they might disguise the task\nas a heroic act, such as righting an injustice, exposing an illegal government\nactivity, or countering a regime of tyranny. This disguise is\ncalled in the parlance of the trade a false flag, as mentioned earlier.\nBy using such a false flag, the SVR did not need to find a candidate\nwho was sympathetic to Russia or the Putin regime. In its long\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 226\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Russians Are Coming | 227\nhistory dating back to the era of the czars, Russian intelligence had\nperfected the technique of false flag recruitment, through which it\nassumes an identity to fit the ideological bent of a potential recruit.\nRussian intelligence was well experienced with false flags. It first\nused this technique following the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 to\ncontrol dissidents both at home and abroad. The centerpiece, as later\nanalyzed by the CIA, was known as the “Trust” deception. It began\nin August 1921 when a high- ranking official of the Communist\nregime in Russia named Aleksandr Yakushev slipped away from a\nSoviet trade delegation in Estonia and sought out a leading anti-\nCommunist exile he had known before the revolution in Russia. He\nthen told him that he represented a group of disillusioned officials in\nRussia that included key members of the secret police, the army, and\nthe Interior Ministry. Yakushev said that they all had come to the\nsame conclusion: the Communist experiment in Russia had totally\nfailed and needed to be replaced. To effect this regime change, they\nhad formed an underground organization code- named the Trust,\nbecause the cover for their conspiratorial activities was the Moscow\nheadquarters of the Municipal Credit Association, which was a trust\ncompany. According to Yakushev’s account, it had become the equivalent\nof a de facto government by 1921.\nThe exiled leader in Estonia reported this astonishing news to\nBritish intelligence, which, along with French and American intelligence,\nhelped fund this newly emerged anti- Communist group.\nInitially, British intelligence had doubts about the bona fides of the\nTrust, as did other Western intelligence services sponsoring exile\ngroups. But they gradually accepted it after they received intelligence\nreports confirming its operations from many other sources,\nincluding Russian officials, diplomats, and military officers who\nclaimed to have defected from the Soviet government. Because these\nreports all dovetailed, they recognized the Trust as a legitimately\nunderground organization.\nOnce the Trust had been established in the minds of the Western\nintelligence services, it offered them as well as exile groups the\nservices of its network of collaborators. These services included\nsmuggling out dissidents, stealing secret documents, and disbursing\nmoney inside Russia to sympathizers. Within a year, exile groups in\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 227\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n228 | how america lost its secrets\nParis, Berlin, Vienna, and Helsinki were using the Trust to deliver\narms and supplies to their partisans inside Russia. The Trust also\nfurnished spies’ and exiled leaders’ fake passports, which allowed\nthem to sneak back into Russia to participate in clandestine missions.\nIt even undertook sabotage and assassination missions paid for\nby Western intelligence services. As they learned of police stations\nbeing blown up and political prisoners escaped from prisons, these\nagents and dissidents came to further believe in the power of the\nTrust.\nBy the mid- 1920s, no fewer than eleven Western intelligence\nservices had become almost completely dependent on the Trust for\ninformation about Russia. They also sent millions of dollars into\nRussia via couriers to finance its activities.\nBut suddenly exiled leaders working in Russia under the aegis\nof the Trust began to vanish. Then top Western intelligence agents,\nincluding Sidney Reilly and Boris Savinkov, were arrested, and their\nnetworks were eliminated. Instead of the Communist regime collapsing,\nas the Trust had predicted, it consolidated its power and\nwiped out all the dissident groups. Finally, in 1929, the Trust was\nrevealed by a defector to be a long- term false flag operation run by\nthe Russian intelligence service. Even the Trust building, rather than\nbeing the cover for a subversive conspiracy, was the headquarters\nfor the Russian secret police during this eight- year operation. The\nsecret police had provided the documents fed to Western intelligence,\nbriefed the agents who pretended to defect, published the dissident\nnewspapers the Trust distributed, fabricated the passports it supplied\nexiles, blew up Russian buildings, and staged jail breaks to make the\ndeception more credible. It also collected the money sent in by Western\nintelligence services, which more than paid for the entire deception.\nBecause it was running the show, it could offer those lured into\nthe trap an opportunity to work for it as double agents. The alternative,\nif they refused, was to face a firing squad.\nEven after the Trust itself had been fully exposed, the Russian intelligence\nservice continued to succeed with other false flag deceptions.\nDuring the Cold War, it set up a fake underground in Poland called\nWIN, modeled on the Trust. It set up false flag groups in Ukraine,\nGeorgia, Lithuania, Albania, and Hungary. It also had agents mas-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 228\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Russians Are Coming | 229\nquerade as members of the security services of Israel, South Africa,\nGermany, France, and the United States to recruit unwitting agents.\nThese deceptions became an integral part of the recruitments of the\nRussian intelligence services.\nPenetrating the NSA and getting access to files from its stovepiped\ncomputers was a far more difficult challenge for the SVR.\nApproaching CIA officers, such as Nicholson, was relatively easy\nbecause it was part of the CIA officers’ jobs to meet with their adversaries.\nNSA officers, on the other hand, did not engage in “dangles”\nor even attend diplomatic receptions. They had no reason, other than\na sinister one, to meet with a member of the Russian intelligence\nservice. Furthermore, unlike CIA officers, who, like Nicholson, are\noften posted in neutral countries where they can be approached in a\nsocial context, NSA officers work at well- guarded regional bases and\nare not part of the diplomatic life. Because a known employee of a\nforeign diplomatic mission could not even approach an NSA officer\nwithout arousing suspicion, the SVR would need to use an intermediary,\ncalled an access agent, whose affiliations were not known\nto the FBI. Such an operation would require establishing a network\nof illegals in America, as the SVR did after Putin became president.\nEven then, the intermediary would have to find a plausible pretext\nto approach the target without revealing his actual interest. Such\ncomplex operations at the NSA, as far as is known, only yielded a\nfew low- level recruits.\nThe emergence of computer networks in the 1990s greatly\nexpanded the SVR’s recruiting horizon. It offered a new penetration\nopportunity at the NSA: civilian technologists working under contract\nfor the U.S. government. Many of these civilians at the NSA,\nespecially the younger ones, as we know, had been drawn from the\nhacking and game- playing culture; some had even taken courses on\nhacking techniques. They presented the SVR with inviting targets\nfor recruitment. As was previously mentioned, Russian intelligence\nhad considerable experience in Germany with hacktivists, who\ntended to be anarchists. There were also supporters of the libertarian\nmovement. The common denominator was often their resentment,\nexpressed in their postings, of the United States and its allies\nattempting to limit the downloading of copyrighted music, movies,\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 229\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n230 | how america lost its secrets\nand software on the Internet, all of which fell under the rubric of\n“freedom of the Internet.” They also vocally objected to the NSA’s\nusing built- in back doors in its software to read their encrypted\nmessages. Such people were not difficult to find on the Internet.\nThe donors to Ron Paul’s libertarian election campaign (including\nSnowden) were a matter of public record.\nEven if there was no shortage of hacktivists who believed the surveillance\nof the Internet by the NSA was an evil worth fighting, the\nSVR still had to find a plausible way of approaching members of\nthis counterculture without offending them. Clearly, the SVR could\nno longer use out- of- date Communist and anti- capitalist ideology\nas a lure. Russia was far more authoritarian than the United States\nwhen it came to the Internet. One viable alternative for the SVR was\ncustom- tailoring false flags to appeal to hacktivists.\nFor this purpose, the Internet provided a near- perfect realm.\nBecause it is a place where true identities cannot easily be verified,\nintelligence services could employ a protean kit of disguises to\nassume false identities to entice potential dissidents into communicating\nwith them. The KGB’s earlier efforts to use hacktivist groups\nin Germany had produced little if any intelligence about the NSA\nbecause of the stovepiping it used to isolate its computers from networks\nthat could be hacked into from the outside. It will be recalled\nthat the NSA threat officer had cited these failures in his 1996 report\non NSA vulnerability. He also said that efforts of the Russian intelligence\nservices to use false flag recruitments provided the KGB with\n“a learning experience.” The KGB had learned that hacking by itself\ncould not breach the NSA’s protective stovepiping. He predicted that\nits next logical move would be to “target insider computer personnel.”\nThis false flag recruitment would aim at, in his view, system\nadministrators, computer engineers, and cyber- service workers who\neither were already inside the NSA or had a security clearance that\nwould facilitate getting jobs with NSA contractors.\nEven with an appropriate false flag, the task of finding such a\n“Prometheus” required obtaining a database of those working at\nthe NSA. There were some five thousand civilian technicians at the\nNSA of all political stripes. Hacking into the personnel records of\nthe intelligence workers seeking to renew their security clearance\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 230\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Russians Are Coming | 231\nwas a place to begin. The Internet provided the SVR with just this\nopportunity. As you will recall, holes in the security of the computer\nnetworks of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and\nUSIS and the websites of the companies supplying the NSA with\nindependent contractors had made the background checks on American\nintelligence workers available to the Chinese, and presumably\nother adversary intelligence service hackers, since 2011. If the SVR\nhad access to this personnel data, the research for a candidate would\nbe greatly facilitated. From the 127- page Standard Form 86, which\neach applicant for a security clearance submits, the SVR could filter\nout intelligence workers employed by the NSA by their educational\nbackground, employment history, affiliations, and foreign contacts.\nIt could then search this data for candidates with a possible hacktivist\nprofile.\nThis data could next be crossed with a list of individuals the SVR\nknew were in contact with high- profile activists who were part of the\nanti- surveillance movements. This would include core participants\nin the Tor Project, WikiLeaks, Noisebridge, CryptoParties, the Freedom\nof the Press Foundation, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n(Snowden, for example, had been in touch with members of all\nthese groups in 2012 and 2013.)\nThe SVR would have little problem monitoring even encrypted\ncommunications with leading figures in the anti- surveillance world.\nThese activists, despite secrecy rituals such as putting their cell\nphones in refrigerators, remain visible to a sophisticated intelligence\nservice such as the SVR. All the defensive tactics of Laura Poitras,\nincluding PGP encryption, Tor software, and air- gapped computers\n(computers that have never been connected to the Internet), did not\nkeep secrets about her sources entirely to herself. Snowden, at a time\nwhen he was stealing NSA secrets in February 2013, went to great\nlengths to impress on Poitras the need for operational security about\nhis contacts with her, but that injunction did not prevent her from\ntelling at least five people about her source, including Micah Lee, the\nBerkeley- based technology operative for the Freedom of the Press\nFoundation; Jacob Appelbaum, the Tor proselytizer; Ben Wizner, the\nACLU lawyer; Barton Gellman; and Glenn Greenwald. “It is not me\nthat can’t keep a secret,” Abraham Lincoln joked. “It’s the people I\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 231\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n232 | how america lost its secrets\ntell it to that can’t.” In the same vein, Poitras could hardly rely on\nthese five confidants not to tell her secrets (and Snowden’s) to others.\nHours after he was told, Greenwald told his lover, David Miranda,\nabout the source in great detail. He even asked him to evaluate the\nsource’s bona fides for him. Gellman, for his part, raised the matter\nwith a former high official at the Justice Department.\nMoreover, as the intelligence world knew, Poitras was herself\na veritable lightning rod for attracting ex- NSA employees who\nobjected to some of its surveillance programs. In 2012, her previously\nmentioned filming in Berlin of NSA insiders could make her\ncommunications of interest to intelligence services that wanted to\nkeep tabs on possible NSA dissidents.\nNor was Snowden himself overly discreet. It will be recalled that\nhe had also advertised his Tor- sponsored CryptoParty activities over\nthe Internet and supplied Runa Sandvik, who worked with Appelbaum,\nhis true name and address in Hawaii. Sandvik had no reason\nnot to share the identity of her co- presenter with others in the Tor\nmovement. Snowden, of course, had his girlfriend make a video of\nhis presentation as well. He also bragged about operating the largest\nTor outlets in Hawaii. Even if his Tor software provided him with a\nmeasure of anonymity, it was not beyond the ability of the worldclass\ncyber services to crack it.\nUnder Putin, Russia had built one of the leading cyber- espionage\nservices in the world. According to a 2009 NSA analysis of Russian\ncapabilities, which was obtained by The New York Times in 2013,\nRussia’s highly sophisticated tools for cyber espionage were superior\nto those of China or any other adversary nation. For example, investigators\nfrom FireEye, a well- regarded Silicon Valley security firm,\nfound that in 2007 Russian hackers had developed a highly sophisticated\nvirus that could bypass the security measures of the servers\nof both the U.S. government and its private contractors. According\nto one computer security expert, the virus had made protected Internet\nwebsites “sitting ducks” for these sophisticated Russian hackers.\nThe cryptographer Bruce Schneier, a leading specialist in computer\nsecurity, explained, “It is next to impossible to maintain privacy and\nanonymity against a well- funded government adversary.”\nNor has the Russian cyber service made a secret out of the fact that\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 232\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Russians Are Coming | 233\nit targets Tor software. It even offered a cash prize to anyone in the\nhacking community who could break Tor. Prior to 2013, according\nto cyber- security experts, it spent over a decade building cyber tools\naimed at unraveling the Tor networks used by hacktivists, criminal\nenterprises, political dissidents, and rival intelligence operatives. To\nthis end, it reportedly attempted to map out computers that served\nas major Tor exit nodes (such as the one Snowden operated in 2012\nnear an NSA regional base in Hawaii). It also reportedly attached\nthe equivalent of “electronic ink” to messages, which would allow\nit to trace the path of messages that passed through them. Through\nthis technology, it could tag and follow Tor users as their communications\ntraveled across the Internet. It could even borrow their\nInternet identities. To be sure, the NSA also had such a capability.\nThe Silk Road founder, Ross Ulbricht, discovered to his distress that\nhis Tor software did not make his computer server in Iceland invisible.\nAccording to a former top official in the Justice Department, the\nNSA was able to locate it by cracking the Tor software (Ulbricht is\ncurrently serving a life sentence for his activities). Unlike adversary\nservices, however, the NSA needs a warrant to investigate U.S. citizens\nwho use Tor.\nThe NSA is hardly immune from an attack on its own computers.\nAs the former CIA deputy director Morell wrote in his 2015 book,\nThe Great War of Our Time, many financial institutions have “better\ncyber security than the NSA.” The Internet certainly helped make\nthe activities of U.S. intelligence workers visible to the SVR.\nBut to achieve its goals, the SVR still had to find at least one disgruntled\ncivilian contractor inside the NSA who had access to the\nsealed- off computer networks. Did it find its man? If so, was it before\nor after Snowden arrived in Hong Kong with the Level 3 NSA files?\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 233\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nc h a p t e r 22\nThe Chinese Puzzle\nThe first [false assumption] is that China is an enemy of the\nUnited States. It’s not.\n— edward snowden, Hong Kong, 2013\nOn august 11, 2014, in the Atlantic Ocean, an event took place\nof enormous concern to U.S. intelligence. A Chinese Jin- class\nsubmarine launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. The missile\nreleased twelve independently targeted reentry vehicles, each simulating\na nuclear warhead. Some forty- four hundred miles away, in\nChina’s test range in the Xinjiang desert, each of the twelve simulated\nnuclear warheads hit its target within a twelve- inch radius.\nThe test firing, which was closely monitored by the NSA, was a\nstrategic game changer. It meant that a single Jin- class submarine,\nwhich carried twelve such missiles and 144 nuclear warheads, could\ndestroy every city of strategic importance in the United States. U.S.\nintelligence further reported that China would soon use stealth\ntechnology to make it more difficult to detect newer submarines and\ngive “China its first credible sea- based nuclear deterrent” against an\nAmerican attack.\nBy 2015, as its test in the Atlantic had foreshadowed, China had\narmed its land- based as well as sea- based missiles with multiple\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 234\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Chinese Puzzle | 235\nindependently targeted warheads. Combined with the state- of- theart\ntechnology it had licensed from Russia, its systematic use of\nespionage even made it possible for China to build its own stealth\nfighters.\nUnlike the United States, China did not achieve this remarkable\ncapability to launch independently targeted miniaturized nuclear\nweapons and stealth them by investing hundreds of billions of dollars\nin developing them. It obtained this technology mainly through\nespionage. The Chinese intelligence service stole a large part, if not\nall, of America’s secret technology for weaponizing nuclear bombs\nduring the 1980s and 1990s. The theft was so massive that in 1998\nthe House of Representatives set up a special bipartisan investigative\nunit called the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and\nMilitary/Commercial Concerns with the People’s Republic of China.\nBased on the intelligence amassed by the NSA, the CIA, and other\nintelligence services, it concluded in its report that the Chinese intelligence\nservice had obtained both by electronic and by conventional\nspying the warhead design of America’s seven most advanced thermonuclear\nweapons. Moreover, it found that espionage successes\nallowed China to so accelerate the design, development, and testing\nof its own nuclear weapons that the new generation of Chinese\nweapons would be “comparable in effectiveness to the weapons used\nby the United States.” Further, the committee reported that these\nthefts were the “results of decades of intelligence operations against\nU.S. weapons laboratories.” The Chinese intelligence service further\nobtained from private U.S. defense contractors through cyber espionage\nimportant elements of the stealth technology used in advanced\nplanes and submarines. China shared (or exchanged) the fruits of its\nespionage on nuclear warhead design with North Korea, Pakistan,\nIran, and Russia.\nDespite its formidable intelligence coups in the United States, the\nChinese intelligence service managed to remain among the most\nelusive of America’s intelligence adversaries. Its espionage organizations\nare hidden behind layers of bureaucracy in the Ministry of\nState Security, Chinese Communist Party structures, and the second,\nthird, and fourth department of the General Staff of the People’s\nLiberation Army. Much of its cyber- espionage units are concealed\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 235\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n236 | how america lost its secrets\non the campuses of its universities. Its hierarchy is also obscure.\nFew traces have been uncovered of any conventional espionage networks\nin the United States, and no major Chinese spy has ever been\narrested. Part of the reason that Chinese espionage has proved so elusive\nto the eyes of Western counterintelligence is that, unlike Russia,\nit did not ordinarily rely on intelligence officers in its embassies to\nrecruit penetration agents to steal secrets. It did not even have an\nembassy in the United States during most of the Cold War. Instead,\nits services specialize in mosaics of intelligence assembled from a\nwide variety of sources, including nonclassified documents, returning\ngraduate students, scientific conferences, exchanges with allies,\nand a vast operation of hacking into computers, or cyber espionage.\nSuch espionage is indeed a vast enterprise in China. Graduating\nover 150,000 computer science engineers in the 1990s, it had no\nshortage of personnel. It had also developed the cyber tool kit to gain\naccess to the computer networks of U.S. government contractors and\nconsultants in the private sector and government agencies, planting\n“sleeper” bugs in networked computers. Like human sleeper agents,\nthese hidden programs can be activated when needed for operational\npurposes. Chinese controllers can often retrieve e- mails and documents\nand can turn on the cameras and microphones of personal\ncomputers, tablets, and smart phones.\nBy 2007, Paul Strassmann, a top U.S. defense expert on cyber\nespionage, reported that China had inserted “zombie” programs in\nsome 700,000 computers in the United States, which could be used to\nmount cyber attacks to retrieve e- mails from other computers. The\nChinese service also reportedly penetrated companies that provide\nInternet services, including Google, Yahoo!, Symantec, and Adobe,\nwhich allowed it to track e- mails and enclosures of individuals. With\nsuch an invisible army of zombie computers, it is not entirely surprising\nthat China finds little need to employ human sleeper agents.\nChinese cyber specialists used this capability to hack into the\ncomputers of outside contractors, including Booz Allen and other\ncompanies that supplied technologists to the NSA. It also had notable\nsuccesses in obtaining the dossiers of U.S. employees and independent\ncontractors at the NSA, the CIA, and other intelligence\nservices. Its intrusions, as previously noted, into computer networks\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 236\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Chinese Puzzle | 237\nat the Office of Personnel Management traced back to 2009. Eventually,\nby 2015, according to U.S. estimates, the cyber attack had\nharvested over twenty million personnel files of past and present\nfederal government employees. In addition, it reaped over fourteen\nmillion background checks of intelligence workers done by the Federal\nInvestigative Services.\nAll intelligence workers with a sensitive compartmented information\nclearance, such as Snowden, were required to provide information\non these forms about all their foreign acquaintances, including\nany non- U.S. officials whom the applicant knew or had had relationships\nwith in the past. They also had to list their foreign travel,\nfamily members, police encounters, mental health issues, and credit\nhistory. For good measure, Chinese hackers obtained the confidential\nmedical histories of government employees by hacking into the\ncomputers of Anthem and other giant health- care companies. If\nChina’s intelligence services consolidated the fruits of these hacking\nattacks, it would have a searchable database of almost everyone\nworking in the American defense and intelligence complex. From\nthis database, it could track individuals with high security clearances\nvulnerable to being bribed, blackmailed, or tricked into cooperating.\nNo one doubted that the Chinese would use their cyber capabilities\nto take advantage of opportunities presented in foreign computer\nsystems.\nGeneral Hayden said of the massive theft of intelligence personnel\nrecords, “Those records are a legitimate foreign intelligence target.”\nHe added, “If I, as director of the NSA or CIA, would have\nhad the opportunity to grab the equivalent in the Chinese system,\nI would not have thought twice.” If that opportunity did not arise\nfor the NSA or the CIA during Hayden’s tenure, it might have been\nbecause no insider in the Chinese intelligence services provided U.S.\nintelligence with a road map to it.\nCyber espionage was not the Chinese intelligence service’s only\npowerful resource in the intelligence war. To get both electronic\nintelligence and human intelligence about the United States, China\nalso had a highly productive intelligence- sharing treaty with Russia.\nIt was signed in 1992 after the Soviet Union was dissolved. Although\nthe terms of this exchange remain secret, defectors from the Rus-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 237\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n238 | how america lost its secrets\nsian KGB and SVR reported that Chinese intelligence received from\nRussia a continuous stream of communications intelligence about\nthe United States in the late twentieth and early twenty- first centuries.\nRussia’s intelligence resources during this period were formidable.\nThey included geosynchronous satellites, listening stations\nin Cuba, sleeper agents, and embassy- based spy networks. Presumably,\nthis relationship further deepened under President Putin’s\nregime. Putin asserted in speeches in 2014 that Russia and China\ncontinued to share a key strategic objective: countering the United\nStates’ domination of international relations, or what Putin terms\n“a unipolar world order.” China’s president, Xi Jinping, expressed a\nvery similar view, saying in 2014 in a thinly veiled reference to the\nUnited States that any attempt to “monopolize” international affairs\nwill not succeed.\nSince the end of the Cold War, Russia has been the major supplier\nof almost all of China’s modern weaponry. It licenses for manufacture\nin China avionics, air defense systems, missile launchers, stealth\ntechnology, and submarine warfare equipment. To make these arms\neffective, it also provides China with up- to- date intelligence about\nthe ability of the United States and its allies to counter them. While\nsuch intelligence cooperation may be limited by the reality that\nChina and Russia still compete in many areas, they still have reason\nto share much of the fruits of their cyber and conventional espionage\nagainst the NSA in accordance with their intelligence. After all,\nthe NSA works to intercept the military and political secrets of both\nthese allies. Moreover, as the CIA’s former deputy director Morell\npoints out in his book, NSA secrets are a form of currency for adversaries\nin the global intelligence war, saying that part of Snowden’s\ncache could be traded by a country that acquired it to the intelligence\nservices of Iran and North Korea.\nSnowden’s stay in Hong Kong from May 20 to June 23 in 2013\nmade the Chinese intelligence service, willy- nilly, a potential player\nin whatever game he was involved in. China’s full responsibility for\nHong Kong’s national security and foreign affairs includes monitoring\nforeign intelligence operatives. Chinese intelligence main-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 238\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Chinese Puzzle | 239\ntains there its largest intelligence base outside mainland China. A\nlarge contingent of its officers are stationed officially in the Prince\nof Wales skyscraper in central Hong Kong and unofficially maintain\ninformers in Hong Kong’s police, governing authority, airport\nadministration, and other levers of power. It checks the computerized\nvisitors entering Hong Kong and has the capability to ferret\nnames that match those in the immense database its global cyber\nespionage has amassed. When it detects the entry of any person of\npossible intelligence interest, it can use its sophisticated array of\ncyber tools to attempt to remotely steal data from that individual.\nSuch remote surveillance was so effective in 2013 that the U.S. State\nDepartment had instructed all its personnel in Hong Kong to avoid\nusing their iPhones, Androids, BlackBerry phones, and other smart\nphones when traveling to Hong Kong or China. Instead, it supplied\nthem with specially altered phones that disable location tracking\nand have a remotely activated switch to completely cut off power\nto its circuitry. No one in the intelligence community doubts the\nprudence of taking such precautions in China, and it is nearly inconceivable\nthat Snowden, whose prior position at the NSA included\nteaching military personnel about Chinese capacities, could himself\nbe unaware of Chinese intelligence service capabilities to acquire\ntravelers’ data in Hong Kong.\nOnce Hong Kong had served as a window into China for Western\nintelligence, but in the first decade of this century the Chinese\nintelligence service had achieved such a pervasive presence in Hong\nKong, and such ubiquitous electronic coverage of diplomats and\nother foreigners even suspected of involvement in foreign intelligence\nwork, that the CIA and British intelligence found it almost\nas difficult to operate in Hong Kong as in mainland China. Even\nthough the CIA kept officers there in 2013, it was considered “hostile\nterritory,” according to the former CIA officer Tyler Drumheller.\nSnowden apparently knew the limits of CIA operations in Hong\nKong, which provided him with an envelope of protection. He told\nGreenwald that he was counting on the Chinese presence in Hong\nKong to deter the CIA from intruding on their meetings.\nWhen he flew to Hong Kong in May 2013, he took with him\nNSA secrets, which he knew would be of great interest to China.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 239\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n240 | how america lost its secrets\nIn fact, he advertised that he had such secrets in his interview with\nthe South China Morning Post. Whatever he might have assumed\nabout the inability of the CIA to stop him in Hong Kong, he could\nnot assume that Chinese intelligence services would relegate themselves\nto a purely passive role when secret NSA documents were in\na hotel room in Hong Kong. Snowden might have esteemed himself\nto be an independent actor playing Prometheus on a global stage\nprovided by YouTube, but the Chinese might have viewed him very\ndifferently indeed.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 240\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nc h a p t e r 23\nA Single Point of Failure\nA single point of failure (SPOF) is a part of a system that, if it\nfails, will stop the entire system from working.\n—Wikipedia\nSnowden described anyone who was the sole repository of\nsecrets that could undo the NSA’s intelligence gathering as “the\nsingle point of failure.” While still shielding his own identity in May\n2013, he wrote to Gellman that U.S. intelligence “will most certainly\nkill you if they think you are the single point of failure that could\nstop this disclosure and make them the sole owner of this information.”\nSuch a person of course would be of even greater interest to\nadversary intelligence services if they were aware of the payload of\nsecrets that person was carrying because they could use it to unravel\nthe NSA’s sources and methods.\nSnowden saw himself as that “single point of failure.” We know\nthat while still in Hong Kong he said he had obtained access to computers\nthat the NSA had penetrated throughout the world and in\nMoscow he added that he had had “access to every [NSA] target,\nevery [NSA] active operation,” against the Chinese. “Full lists of\nthem,” which, if he chose to share them, could make China “go\ndark.” To be sure, he did not refer to Russian intelligence activity in\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 241\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n242 | how america lost its secrets\nany interview that he ever gave in Moscow under Russian protection,\nbut he had similar access to NSA operations against Russia in\nhis job at the NSA’s Threat Operations Center.\nThe enormous power of the NSA rested in its ability to keep its\nsources and methods secret from its foes. A queen on the chessboard\ncould be captured by a lowly pawn if it was well- placed. In\nthis case, the person who had it in his power to expose the NSA’s\ncritical sources and methods would no doubt be considered fair game\nby America’s adversaries, including the Chinese and Russian cyber\nservices. Indeed, how could they resist such a prize?\nSnowden might have believed that he was in control, but the CIA\nbelieved that confidence was misinformed. “Snowden thinks he is\nsmart,” Morell said, after reviewing the case on a panel appointed\nby President Obama, “but he was never in a position in his previous\njobs to fully understand the immense capabilities of our Russian and\nChinese counterparts.” He could adopt a cocky tone in his postmortem\nconversations with journalists in Moscow, but in truth he had\nno means to block the efforts of the Chinese or Russian services in\nHong Kong. Even before Snowden contacted its diplomats in Hong\nKong, the Russian intelligence service would swing into action to\ndetermine his intelligence value.\nHow many days he planned to be in Hong Kong depended on how\nspeedily he could arrange a meeting with journalists. “The purpose of\nmy [Hong Kong] mission was to get the information to journalists,”\nhe told the editor of The Guardian after he was safely ensconced in\nMoscow. He indicates that he was working under a tight clock. The\ntime pressure resulted in his e- mailing an ultimatum to Gellman on\nMay 24: either Gellman would publish the selected documents in\nThe Washington Post within seventy- two hours, or he would lose\nthe exclusive scoop. Snowden wanted the story to break on May 27,\nwithout his true identity (which Gellman did not know) attached to\nit. His identity would be known to a foreign mission in Hong Kong if\nGellman acceded to his demands, because, as previously mentioned,\nGellman’s story would enclose an encoded signal he planned to use\nas proof of his bona fides. So even before the Guardian reporters had\nagreed to come to Hong Kong, Snowden had plans to deal with a\nforeign mission. If the Post had accepted his terms, Snowden would\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 242\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nA Single Point of Failure | 243\nhave been in a very different position. The story would have broken\nbefore Poitras or Greenwald even knew about Snowden’s presence\nin Hong Kong, and his identity would be secret except for whatever\nforeign mission he had contacted. But, as we know, the Post turned\ndown his ultimatum.\nTime was running out if he was to break the story and leave Hong\nKong before the NSA realized he was missing. At best, he was safe\nuntil June 3, when he was supposed to return from his medical leave.\nIf he failed to show up in Hawaii on June 3, alarm bells at the NSA\nwould go off, and it would not take long to find him. Airline records\nwould show that he had flown to Hong Kong. Snowden told Poitras\nthat NSA security would ask, “This guy isn’t where he says\nhe’s supposed to be. He’s supposed to be getting medical treatment.\nWhy the hell is he in Hong Kong?” It would not take long to determine\nthat he had lied about his medical treatment, and then the hunt\nwould begin.\nHe had, remember, already sent Poitras an enciphered file and told\nher she would get the key once she followed his instructions. Greenwald\nhad still not committed himself to meeting Snowden. Greenwald\nwas, however, willing to publish the documents once Snowden\nprovided them. That Snowden remained in Hong Kong suggests that\nhis reason for going to and remaining in Hong Kong went beyond\njust delivering documents to journalists, which he could have done\nover the Internet. What he could not do in America, without risking\narrest, was to make and release a video.\nIn any event, after his attempt to pressure the Post, Snowden\nasked Greenwald to fly immediately to Hong Kong. Presumably, he\nstill wanted Greenwald’s story and the video done in Hong Kong\nbefore he became a suspect. If Greenwald and Poitras had immediately\nflown to Hong Kong, it still might have left Snowden an escape\nwindow.\nBut of course things do not always go as planned. Greenwald,\nalthough agreeing to come to Hong Kong, waited in New York\nfor two days while the Guardian editors completed their due diligence.\nPoitras waited with him. As a result of this delay, as we know,\nGreen wald and Poitras did not arrive at his hotel in Hong Kong until\nJune 3, only hours before Snowden became suspect at the NSA. “It\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 243\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n244 | how america lost its secrets\nwas a nervous period,” Snowden recalled. Although he bravely told\nThe Guardian “there was no risk” that the information he carried\nhad been compromised by other parties in Hong Kong, that claim\nwas, at best, wishful thinking on his part.\nBy this time, he had registered at the hotel under his true name\nand provided his credit card; he was in contact with three highprofile\njournalists, two well- known hacktivists, and, as he suggested\nto Gellman, a foreign diplomatic mission.\nThe mission’s interest would likely be piqued when the newspaper\npublished its first story on June 6. Greenwald then went on\nTV in Hong Kong, revealing to every interested intelligence service\nthat a defector from the NSA was in Hong Kong providing secret\ndocuments.\nPoitras released the famous video showing Snowden and secret\nNSA documents three days later. At this point, Snowden shone\nbrightly as a beacon to NSA secrets to every player in the intelligence\ngame, even if they did not know the extent of the damage he\ncould inflict on American intelligence.\nSnowden fogged over his travel plans to the media by telling\nreporters that he intended to remain in Hong Kong and fight extradition,\nbut certainly the Russian officials whom he contacted became\naware that he had other plans, having relayed his request to go to\nRussia to their superiors in Moscow. And, unlike the media, any\nsophisticated intelligence service was well aware of his movements.\nIn Hong Kong, cell phones emit their GPS location every three seconds;\neven if Snowden disabled his own phone, lawyers and helpers\ncould be tracked with ease.\nChina’s president, Xi Jinping, who was meeting President Obama\nfor the first time in Rancho Mirage, California, on June 8, would\nhave been keenly interested in the unfolding Snowden affair. Obama\nhad publicly called Xi to task for Chinese cyber espionage, and now\nthat charge was undermined by Snowden’s accusation that the\nUnited States was engaged in massive cyber espionage. U.S. intelligence\nverified that China instituted a full- court press of Snowden\nin Hong Kong immediately after the release of the video. From\nthat moment on, any communication or movement Snowden made\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 244\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nA Single Point of Failure | 245\nduring his next fifteen days in Hong Kong would not likely escape\nChina’s scrutiny.\nThe United States had the ability to also follow Snowden’s movements\nvia the cell phones of his lawyers and other confederates\nafter he surfaced. All tracking could be done by the NSA. What the\nUnited States lacked was any practical means to capture a highprofile\nintelligence defector in a city that was part of China. By this\ntime, U.S. intelligence had established that Chinese and Hong Kong\nsecurity services were monitoring Snowden’s every move. This left\nfew options in the game for the United States. “I’m not going to\nbe scrambling jets to get a twenty- nine- year- old hacker,” President\nObama said on June 27.\nThe real prize, in any case, was not Snowden but the NSA’s secret\ndocuments that he had with him. When Snowden was observed\nentering the Russian consulate, the game was all but over. U.S. diplomats\ncould protest over back channels to Moscow, as they did, but\nwith a trove of NSA secrets at stake there was little expectation that\nwould stop the Russians. Two days later, the “single point of failure,”\nas Snowden described himself, was on his way to Russia, where his\nhosts would be calling the shots.\nWhen a victory is obtained in a major sports event, it is cause for\npublic celebrations. The opposite is true in espionage. An intelligence\nvictory involving secret documents, even if it cannot be entirely\nhidden, is kept veiled, as far as is possible, to increase the value of\nthe coup. “The final move in any sophisticated intelligence game,”\nAngleton told me in relation to espionage intelligence, is “obscuring\na success.”\nFollowing Angleton’s precept, the Russian or Chinese intelligence\nservices, if they had a role in acquiring the product of the selfdescribed\n“single point of failure,” would work to cover their tracks in\nthe affair even before the Aeroflot plane carrying Snowden touched\ndown at Sheremetyevo International Airport on June 23. If any false\nflag operations had been used to trick, mislead, or otherwise induce\nSnowden to come to Hong Kong, they would be disbanded. If any\nsafe house had been used to quarter Snowden in his first eleven days\nin Hong Kong, it would be shut down. If any operatives had been\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 245\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n246 | how america lost its secrets\nused in Hawaii to guide or assist Snowden, they would be put back\ninto sleeper mode. If any telltale traces had been left in chat rooms\nor social media, they would be systematically deleted. Even more\nimportant to the ultimate success of such a communications intelligence\ncoup, measures would be taken to conceal the extent of the\ndamage done by the “single point of failure” by not precipitously\nclosing down compromised sources. Snowden might believe that\nthe power of the information he held was so great that if disclosed\nby him, all the NSA’s sources would immediately go dark in Russia\nand China, but Russia might not wish to provide such clarity to its\nadversaries. An intelligence service need not close down channels\nit discovers are compromised by an adversary. Instead, it can elect\nto continue to use them and furnish through them bits of sensitive\nor misleading information to advance its own national interest. The\nreal danger here was not that the NSA’s “lights” would dramatically\nbe extinguished but that all the future messages illuminated by\nthose lights would be less reliable sources of intelligence. The game\nof nations is, after all, merely a competition among adversaries to\ngain advantages by the surreptitious exchange of both twisted and\nstraight information.\nTo review: When the NSA asserted in the summer of 2013 that\nover one million documents had been compromised, it was recognizing\nthe most massive failure in its sixty- year history. Not only\nwere NSA secrets taken, but secret files from the CIA, the British\nGCHQ, and America’s cyber military commands had been compromised.\nIt was, as Sir David Omand, the former head of the British\nGCHQ, described it, a “huge strategic setback” for the West. The\ngenie could not be put back into the bottle. There is not a reset button\nin this game. The best that the NSA could do now was damage\ncontrol while its adversaries took full advantage of the setback. Several\nhundred U.S. and British intelligence officers worked around the\nclock in Washington, D.C., Fort Meade, Maryland, and Cheltenham,\nEngland, for months on end to determine which parts of the most\npowerful communications intelligence system in the world could be\nsalvaged from what had been the Snowden breach.\nAdding insult to injury, Snowden, speaking from his new perch\nin Moscow, told applauding audiences that the entire purpose of\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 246\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nA Single Point of Failure | 247\nthe U.S. exercise, including deliberately “trapping” him in Moscow,\nwas to “demonize” him. “There was no question that I was going\nto be subject to a demonization campaign.” Snowden said in Moscow,\n“They [Greenwald and Poitras] actually recorded me on camera\nsaying this before I revealed my identity.” Snowden asserted this\n“demonization” was to divert attention from the government’s own\ncrimes. By providing Snowden with this platform to rail against the\nputative machinations of the United States, Putin laid claim to the\nmoral high ground.\nSnowden’s motive in requesting documents from other foreign\nintelligence services, such as the GCHQ, and copying lists of NSA\nsources remains unexplained. It is difficult to believe that his motive\nwas whistle- blowing, because these documents were not among\nthose he gave to journalists in Hong Kong. Indeed, he did not provide\nthe journalists with the lists of sources that were particularly\nrelevant to the NSA’s surveillance of Russia. His legal representative\nin Moscow, Kucherena, confirmed that Snowden had taken\nsecret “material” to Russia and had access to NSA documents that\nhe had not given to journalists. Those unrevealed documents would\nbe prized by many an adversary service. Did he use those documents\nas leverage in his transformation? The role that Moscow might have\nplayed in Snowden’s defection clearly requires a closer examination\nof the machinations that brought Snowden to Russia. That is why I\nvisited Moscow in October 2015.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 247\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 248\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\npart four\nMOSCOW CALLING\nDeception is a state of mind— and the mind of the state.\n— james jesus angleton\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 249\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 250\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nc h a p t e r 24\nOff to Moscow\nThey talk about Russia like it’s the worst place on earth. Russia’s\ngreat.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2015\nBefore flying to Moscow, I arranged to have dinner with\nOliver Stone at an Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side of\nNew York. I had greatly respected Stone’s ability as a film director\nafter watching him work on Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, a film\nin which I had a cameo role. I had also debated Stone about the historical\naccuracy of his 1991 movie JFK at Town Hall in New York.\nWhen we dined, he had just written, produced, and directed\nSnowden, an independently financed film depicting Snowden, as\nStone put it, as “one of the great heroes of the twenty- first century.”\nIn preparing for it, Stone had seen Snowden in 2013 and 2014 and\nhad had a six- hour meeting with Putin.\nI wanted to talk to Stone not to learn about the film but to learn\nhow he had gained access to Snowden in Moscow. I knew from the\ndocuments taken from Sony Pictures Entertainment— allegedly by\nNorth Korea— that Stone had paid The Guardian $700,000 for the\nfilm rights to The Snowden Files, a book written by Luke Harding.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 251\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n252 | how america lost its secrets\nThese documents also revealed that Stone had paid Anatoly Kucherena,\nSnowden’s legal representative in Moscow, $1 million, supposedly\nfor the rights to his novel, Time of the Octopus. Even by\nHollywood standards, $1 million was an extraordinary sum to pay\nfor a yet- to- be- published work of Russian fiction, and it was especially\nstriking because Stone was making a fact- based movie using\nthe actual names of the characters, and he had already bought the\nrights to The Snowden Files.\n“Is your script based on Kucherena’s Time of the Octopus?” I\nasked.\n“No,” Stone replied. “I haven’t used it.”\nHe said that the payment was for what he termed “total access.”\nHe explained that Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, the producers\nof the James Bond franchise, had optioned Greenwald’s book\nNo Place to Hide to make into a movie about Snowden for Sony.\nStone said that the million- dollar deal with Kucherena effectively\nguaranteed that any competing project would not have access to\nSnowden. Sony consequently put the competing film on hold.\nLawyers often negotiate deals on behalf of a client, but blocking a\ncompeting film requires considerably more influence with the powers\nthat be in Russia. Kucherena, though, was no ordinary lawyer.\nAmong other influential positions, I noted earlier, he was on the public\nboard of the Russian federal security bureau, which had assumed\nthe domestic operations of the defunct KGB in April 1995. In light\nof such connections, Stone said Kucherena might be acting as an\nintermediary for other parties who controlled access to Snowden in\nRussia. In any case, his concern was making a movie, and Kucherena\ndelivered the exclusive access to Snowden.\nAside from being a skilled director, Stone is a shrewd producer\nwho knows how to close a deal. He assessed, correctly as it turned\nout, that his project coupled with the payment to Kucherena would\neffectively block Sony’s competing project. Where the money went\nwas far less clear.\nToward the end of our dinner, Stone told me that he did not know\nI was writing a book about Snowden until a few weeks earlier. He\nlearned of my book from Snowden himself. He said Snowden had\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 252\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nOff to Moscow | 253\nexpressed concern to him about the direction of the book I was writing.\n“What is it about?” Stone asked me.\nI was taken aback. I had no idea that Snowden was aware of my\nbook. (I had not tried to contact him.) I told Stone that I considered\nSnowden an extraordinary man who had changed history and was\nintentionally vague in my description of my book’s contents. Stone\nseemed to be reassured, so I asked him about the possibility of my\nseeing Snowden in Moscow. He said that I “might want to speak\nto Anatoly [Kucherena].” Kucherena, it seemed to me, was clearly\nSnowden’s gatekeeper.\nIn Snowden’s two years in Moscow, he, or his handlers, had granted\nonly a handful of face- to- face press interviews. Most of these were\nwith the journalists who had published his story, but one was with\nJames Bamford for his 2014 Wired piece. According to Bamford, it\ntook nearly nine months to arrange the meeting. “I have been trying\nto set up an interview with him [Snowden]— traveling to Berlin,\nRio de Janeiro twice, and New York multiple times to talk with\nthe handful of his confidants who can arrange a meeting,” Bamford\nrecounted in Wired. After my dinner with Stone, I hoped to find a\nquicker route.\nI was advised by a Moscow- based journalist that I needed a\n“fixer,” the curious term that journalists commonly use to describe a\nlocal intermediary who arranges appointments in foreign countries.\nI retained Zamir Gotta, a highly respected TV producer in Moscow,\nwho I was told had helped “fix” the Bamford interview with\nSnowden.\n“There is only one door to Snowden,” Zamir wrote to me. “His\nname is Kucherena.” Zamir said Kucherena rarely saw journalists,\nbut he had a contact in his office. He further told me Kucherena\nrequired any journalist seeking an interview with Snowden to\nsubmit his questions to the lawyer two weeks in advance and, if\napproved, to sign a document stating he would not deviate from the\nquestions. Next, my questions had to be translated from English to\nRussian (even though Snowden does not speak Russian) and then\nvetted by Kucherena’s staff. Zamir also suggested I stay at the Hotel\nNational in Red Square because Snowden had gone there for pre-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 253\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n254 | how america lost its secrets\nvious meetings with Bamford. So I sent Kucherena, via Zamir, ten\nquestions that I wanted to ask Snowden.\nI next obtained a multi- entry Russian visa from the Russian consulate\nin New York and booked myself a room in the Hotel National.\nMy night flight from New York to Moscow took just less than\neight hours and landed at Terminal D of Sheremetyevo International\nAirport at 7:40 a.m. on October 29, 2015. I did not immediately\nproceed through passport control, in part because I wanted to\nexplore the transit zone in which Snowden was supposedly trapped\nfor six weeks.\nSheremetyevo Two, where all international flights land, was built\nin the waning days of the Cold War for international passengers\narriving for the Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics. It was modernized\nin 2010, including opening a walkway that connects Terminals\nD, E, and F for transit passengers.\nSnowden had vanished, at least from public view, in this complex\nof terminals for nearly six weeks in the summer of 2013. His\nexplanation to journalists, as will be recalled, was two part. First, he\nsaid he had planned to board the next fight to Cuba and from there\nproceed to Ecuador. He said that he was unable to board this flight\nbecause his passport had been invalidated by the U.S. government\nwhile he was flying to Russia. Second, after discovering his passport\nhad been revoked, he stayed in a capsule hotel in the transit zone for\nthe next thirty- nine days. To better understand the plausibility of\nhis version of those events, I proceeded through the transit passage\nto Terminal F, where Snowden’s plane from Hong Kong had landed\nat 5:15 p.m. Moscow time on June 23, 2013.\nSnowden did not go through passport control upon arrival.\nBefore any of the other passengers were allowed to disembark from\nthe plane, Russian plainclothes officers from the special services\nboarded the plane and asked both Snowden and Sarah Harrison, his\nWikiLeaks- supplied “ninja,” to accompany them to a waiting car\nthat whisked them away. According to the account in Izvestia, “A\nspecial operation was conducted for his reception and evacuation.” It\nfurther said, “Snowden’s flight to Moscow was coordinated with the\nRussian authorities and intelligence services.”\nIf not for the “special operation,” he could have easily gone by foot\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 254\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nOff to Moscow | 255\nto Terminal E. It is a nine- minute walk through the transit passageway.\nSnowden, though, had one good reason for not going to Ecuador,\neven if Russia had permitted it. He believed that he would be\nvulnerable to rendition by the U.S. government in Ecuador. “If they\n[the U.S. government] really wanted to capture me, they would’ve\nallowed me to travel to Latin America, because the CIA can operate\nwith impunity down there,” he explained in the previously cited\ninterview with Katrina vanden Heuvel, the editor of The Nation, in\n2014. He had already discussed the likelihood of his being captured\nin Ecuador with Assange before his departure for Moscow. He later\ntold Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian, that he considered\nhimself at risk in Latin America. So why would Snowden, who told\nGreenwald that his “first priority” was his own “physical safety,”\nleave the comparative safety of Russia to put himself in jeopardy in\nEcuador?\nHe had not obtained a visa to Ecuador at its consulate in Hong\nKong, as Kucherena confirmed. The Ecuador destination was, as we\nhave seen, a cover story put out by Assange and his associates, and it\nworked with the press.\nOver a hundred reporters and photographers scrambled aboard\nAeroflot Flight SU150 to Cuba the next morning in response to this\nanonymous tip on a website, but Snowden was not aboard that flight\nand was not seen in Terminal E. By the time the plane landed in\nCuba, Aeroflot denied that anyone named Snowden had ever been\nbooked on any of its flights to Cuba, a denial it continued to repeat to\nevery reporter who queried the airline for the next six weeks.\nThe first news that Snowden was still in Russia came on July 1,\n2013. A statement posted on the WikiLeaks website— and signed\n“Edward Snowden”— after thanking “friends new and old” for his\n“continued liberty,” accused President Obama of pressuring “leaders\nof nations from which I have requested protection to deny my asylum\npetitions.” It added, “This kind of deception from a world leader\nis not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are\nthe old, bad tools of political aggression.” In fact, Snowden had not\nsuffered a “penalty of exile,” because his passport was still valid for\nreturning to the United States, but that was not an option for him as\nthe statement made clear.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 255\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n256 | how america lost its secrets\nBecause the Aeroflot flight to Cuba was the only means of getting\ndirectly from Moscow to Latin America, Russian reporters,\nencouraged by WikiLeaks posts, continued taking the daily elevenhour\nflight to Cuba until August 1. The charade only ended when\nKucherena said in a press conference at the airport that Snowden\nwould be taking up residency at an undisclosed location in Moscow\nand walked out of the airport with Snowden.\nSarah Harrison, Snowden’s companion on the plane to Moscow,\ntold Vogue that she and Snowden for thirty- nine days had shared\na windowless room in the transit zone of the airport where they\nwatched TV, washed their clothes in a sink basin, and ate meals from\nthe nearby Burger King. The only hotel with windowless rooms\nin the transit zone in 2013 was the Vozdushny V- Express Capsule\nHotel, located next to a newly opened Burger King.\nThe polite V- Express desk clerk, who spoke English, showed me\nthe standard windowless double room. It was approximately twentyfour\nsquare feet in area. Most of the floor space was taken up by twin\nbeds. Across from the bed, behind a plastic curtain, was a stall with\na shower, a toilet, and a sink. It would be very cramped quarters for\ntwo people to share for such an extended period. It cost 850 rubles an\nhour (about $18 in 2013). For thirty- nine days, that hourly charge\nwould have added up to $16,600. Snowden claimed to the BBC that\nhe brought a large cache of cash to Russia, which he could have used\nto pay the hotel. But such a long stay was not allowed, according to\nthe desk clerk. The maximum stay allowed by the hotel was twentyfour\nhours. So either the rule was waived for Snowden, or Harrison\ndid not tell the full truth.\nI learned from a former KGB officer that there are VIP quarters\nbeyond the confines of the airport, including suites at the fourhundred-\nroom Novotel hotel, which is located about seven miles\naway, that are used for debriefing and other purposes by the security\nservices. According to him, the security services are not restricted\nfrom entering and leaving the transit zone.\nThe possibility that Snowden was staying elsewhere would help\nexplain the futile search for him by a large number of reporters\nover those thirty- nine days. When they learned from tweets that\nSnowden was not aboard the plane to Havana on June 24, for weeks\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 256\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nOff to Moscow | 257\nthey aggressively questioned all the restaurant employees, security\nguards, and airport personnel they could find. They also bought\nbusiness- class tickets on flights just to gain access to VIP lounges in\nthe transit zones. Despite this intensive search, none of them found\na single person who had seen Snowden, although his image was constantly\nshown on airport TV screens. Egor Piskunov, a reporter for\nRT television, even rented a room in the V- Express Capsule Hotel\nand “tipped” hotel employees, trying, without success, to get information.\nPiskunov told me, “It was a total vanishing act.”\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 257\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nc h a p t e r 25\nThrough the Looking Glass\nThere’s definitely a deep state. Trust me, I’ve been there.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2014\nWhile waiting to hear back from Kucherena’s office, I\narranged to meet with Victor Cherkashin, who had been one\nof the most successful KGB spy handlers in the Cold War. Cherkashin,\nborn in 1932, had served in the KGB’s espionage branch\nfrom 1952 until 1991 and now operated a private security firm in\nMoscow. I was particularly interested in his recruitment of three\ntop American intelligence officers: Aldrich Ames of the CIA, Robert\nHanssen of the FBI, and Ronald Pelton of the NSA. I hoped that seeing\nthese intelligence coups through the eyes, and mind- set, of their\nKGB handler might provide some historical context for the Snowden\ndefection. So I invited Cherkashin to lunch at Gusto, a quiet Italian\nrestaurant, located near the Chekhov Theater in Moscow.\nCherkashin, a tall thin man with silver hair, showed up promptly\nat 1:00 p.m., wearing an elegant gray suit and dark tie. He walked\nwith a spry step. Because he had served in counterintelligence in the\nSoviet embassy in Washington, D.C., for nearly a decade, he spoke\nflawless English.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 258\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThrough the Looking Glass | 259\nI began by asking him about one of the more celebrated cases he\nhad handled for the KGB, that of Ames, who had acted as a Russian\nmole in the CIA between April 1985 and January 1994. In those nine\nyears, he rose, or was maneuvered by the KGB, into a top position\nin the CIA’s highly sensitive Counterintelligence Center Analysis\nGroup, which allowed him to deliver hundreds of top secrets to the\nKGB. In return, according to Cherkashin, Ames received between\n$20,000 and $50,000 in cash for each delivery, which amounted to\n$4.6 million over the nine years.\nI asked Cherkashin about the weakness the KGB looked for in an\nAmerican intelligence worker that might lead him to copy and steal\ntop secret documents. How did he spot a potential Ames? Was it a\nfinancial problem? Was it a sexual vulnerability? Was it an ideological\nleaning?\n“Nothing so dramatic,” he answered. When assessing Ames’s\nbiographical data, Cherkashin said he was looking for a well- placed\nintelligence officer who was both dissatisfied with and antagonistic\nto the service for which he worked.\n“The classic disgruntled employee,” I interjected.\n“Any intelligence officer who strongly feels that his superiors are\nnot listening to him, and that they are doing stupid things, is a candidate,”\nhe continued. He said he had found that the flaw in a prospect\nthat could be most dependably exploited was not his greed, lust,\nor deviant behavior but his resentment over the way he was being\ntreated.\n“Is that how you spotted Ames?”\n“Actually, he approached us, not vice versa.” It was his job in the\nCIA to approach opposition KGB officers. “But, yes, we saw the\npotential,” he said.\nBecause Ames had been paid $50,000 in cash by Cherkashin for\nhis first delivery, I asked whether he fit into the category of a disgruntled\nemployee.\n“Wasn’t he just a mercenary?” I asked.\n“I knew from our intelligence reports that he needed money\nfor debts stemming from his divorce,” he answered. “But he was\nalso angry at the stupidity and paranoia of those running the CIA.\nAmes told me at our first secret meeting that they were misleading\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 259\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n260 | how america lost its secrets\nCongress by exaggerating the Soviet threat.” Cherkashin evaluated\nAmes as a man who felt not only slighted by his superiors but “helpless\nto do anything about it” within the bureaucracy of the CIA.\n“The money we gave, even if he could spend only a small portion\nof it, gave him a sense of worth.” He explained that the KGB had\nan entire team of psychologists in Moscow that worked on further\nexploiting Ames’s resentment against his superiors.\nThe search for an adversary intelligence officer who resents his\nservice was not limited to KGB recruiters. It was also the “classic\nattitude” that the CIA sought to exploit in its adversaries, according\nto a former deputy director. “You find someone working for the\nother side and tell him that he is not receiving the proper recognition,\npay, and honors due him,” Morell said, pointing out that the\nsame “psychological dynamic” could be used to motivate someone\nto “act alone” in gathering espionage material.\nI next turned to an even more important KGB coup with Cherkashin:\nthe Robert Hanssen case. From the KGB’s perspective, Hanssen\nwas an extraordinary espionage source. He was a walk- in who\nnever entered the Soviet embassy or met with KGB case officers, but\nin working as a KGB mole between 1979 and 2001, he had delivered\neven more documents to the Russian intelligence services than\nAmes. Cherkashin learned of this potential spy when he received an\nanonymous letter from him identifying an FBI source in the Soviet\nembassy. When that tip proved to be accurate, Cherkashin got the\nresources he needed from the KGB to develop this source. From the\nstart of his work for the KGB, Hanssen laid down his own rules.\nThe KGB would deliver cash from which all the fingerprints were\nremoved to locations, or “dead drops,” he specified. He would deliver\ndocuments exposing FBI, CIA, and NSA sources and methods in\nanother dead drop. The KGB would precisely follow his instructions.\nCherkashin told me that Hanssen’s “astounding self- recruitment”\nwas executed in such a way that the KGB never actually controlled\nhim. “He was our most important mole and we didn’t ever know his\nidentity, where he worked, or how he had access to FBI, CIA, and\nNSA files.” Even so, the KGB (and later the SVR) paid him $600,000\nin cash. In return, the anonymous spy delivered twenty- seven com-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 260\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThrough the Looking Glass | 261\nputer disks containing hundreds of secret documents revealing the\nsources and methods of American intelligence. According to Cherkashin,\nit was the largest haul of top secret documents ever obtained\nby the KGB (although it was only a small fraction of the number of\ntop secret NSA, Department of Defense, and CIA documents taken\nby Snowden in 2013). Cherkashin told me the price paid by Moscow\nwas a great bargain because it helped compromise “the NSA’s most\nadvanced electronic interception technology,” including a tunnel\nunder the Soviet embassy.\nYet it was only after newspapers reported that Hanssen had been\narrested by the FBI in February 2001 that Cherkashin learned the\nname and position of the spy he had recruited. Cherkashin told me\nthat what mattered to the KGB was not “control” of an agent but the\nvalue of the secrets he or she delivered. “Control is not necessary in\nespionage as long as we manage to obtain the documents.” So in the\neyes of the KGB, anyone who elected to provide it with U.S. secrets\nwas a spy.\n“All we knew was that he delivered valuable documents to us and\nasked for cash in return,” he said. “We didn’t control him; he controlled\nus.”\nAn uncontrolled mole who provided secrets to the KGB and the\nSVR for twenty- two years was very different from fictional moles\nin the spy movies. I asked whether it would have been better if the\nKGB had him under its control.\n“Possibly,” Cherkashin answered. “But as it turned out, Hanssen\nwas by far our most valuable penetration in the Cold War.”\n“Could Hanssen really be called a mole?” I asked.\n“A ‘mole’ is a term used in spy fiction,” he said. “We prefer the\nmore general term ‘espionage source.’ ”\n“So anyone who delivers state secrets to the KGB, for whatever\nreason, is an espionage source?” I asked.\n“Certainly, if the information is valuable to us,” Cherkashin\nanswered.\n“If some unknown person simply delivered a trove of top secret\ncommunications secrets to the doorstep of Russia, would it be\naccepted?” I asked with Snowden in mind.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 261\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n262 | how america lost its secrets\n“I can’t say what the SVR would do today. I am long retired,” he\nsaid, with a nostalgic shake of his head. “But in my day, we needed\nsome reason to believe the gift was genuine.”\n“Would you need to vet the person delivering it?”\n“With Hanssen we did not have that opportunity,” he said. “If\nwe believed the documents were genuine, we would of course grab\nthem.”\nThe final recruitment I asked Cherkashin about was that of Ronald\nPelton, the civilian employee of the NSA who had retired in 1979.\nPelton had left the NSA without taking any classified documents\nwith him. After retiring, he had financial difficulties, and he sought\nto get money from the KGB. On January 14, 1980, he walked into\nthe Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., and asked to see an intelligence\nofficer. After he was ushered into a secure debriefing room, he\nsaid that he had information that Russia would find interesting, but\nhe wanted money in return. What interested me about the Pelton\ncase was that Cherkashin proceeded to recruit Pelton, even though\nhe was no longer working at the NSA and no longer had access to\nthe NSA. In addition, because the FBI had twenty- four- hour surveillance\non the embassy, Pelton had almost certainly been photographed\nentering it and had also possibly been recorded asking for\nan intelligence officer by electronic bugs that the KGB suspected the\nNSA had planted there. What did the KGB do in a situation in which\na former civilian employee at the NSA possessed no documents?\nDespite the risks involved, Cherkashin decided Pelton had to be\ndebriefed by communications intelligence specialists. So he had him\ndisguised as a utility worker and smuggled out in a van to the residential\ncompound of the ambassador in Georgetown. A few days\nlater, he was dropped off at a shopping mall.\n“Why did you go to such effort if Pelton had neither documents\nnor access to the NSA?” I asked.\n“It was the information in his head that we wanted.” Cherkashin\nsaid that because the KGB rarely got access to any NSA officer, it\nwas worth the risk. So Pelton was given $5,000 in cash and a plane\nticket to Vienna, where he was domiciled at the residence of the\nSoviet ambassador to Austria. A KGB electronic communications\nexpert, Anatoly Slavnov, was then sent to Vienna to supervise the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 262\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThrough the Looking Glass | 263\nPelton debriefings. The debriefing sessions, which went on for fifteen\ndays, were from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. In them, Pelton managed to\nrecall Project A, a joint NSA- CIA- navy operation in which submarines\nsurreptitiously tapped into Soviet undersea cables in the Sea\nof Okhotsk, which connected to the Soviet Pacific Fleet’s mainland\nheadquarters at Vladivostok. Pelton received another $30,000 from\nthe KGB.\n“Did the information in his head prove valuable?” I asked.\n“As long as the NSA didn’t know the tap was compromised by\nPelton, we could use the cable to send the NSA the information we\nwanted it to intercept.” He said that while actual NSA documents\nwould have proved more useful than someone’s memories, “Our job\nis to take advantage of whatever we can get.”\nTwo years later, Pelton was again flown to Vienna for another\ndebriefing to see if he could recall any further details. According to\nCherkashin, the KGB’s job was to leave no stone unturned when\nit came to the NSA’s sources. In 1985, the KGB’s task ended when\nPelton was arrested by the FBI. Like Ames and Hanssen, Pelton was\nsentenced to life imprisonment.\nLooking at his watch, Cherkashin politely excused himself.\nI subsequently spoke to Colonel Oleg Nechiporenko, who had\nbeen a foreign intelligence officer in the KGB between 1958 and\n1985 and continued his intelligence work until recently as chief\ncounterterrorism expert of the Russian- led Collective Security\nTreaty Organization. Over a leisurely coffee in the bar of the Hotel\nNational, he told me that many “walk- ins” who contacted Soviet\nofficials in his time were emotionally disturbed, but all of them had\nto be assessed for possible intelligence value. “Our job was to find\nespionage sources,” he said with a twinkle in his eye. “The Internet\nhas changed the espionage business since secret documents can be\nmassively downloaded by an unhappy employee,” he said, “but they\nstill need to be assessed by a professional.”\nThrough the eyes of the KGB, a penetration of American intelligence\nwas clearly opportunistic. If these practices continued, they\nput Snowden’s situation in a new light for me. If Russian intelligence\nconsidered it worthwhile to send a former civilian worker at\nthe NSA, such as Ronald Pelton, two thousand miles from Washing-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 263\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n264 | how america lost its secrets\nton, D.C., to Austria so that its specialists could debrief him on the\nsecrets he held in his head, it would have an even greater interest in\nexfiltrating Snowden from Hong Kong to get, aside from his documents,\nwhatever secrets he held in his head. If Russian intelligence\nwere willing to opportunistically accept the delivery of U.S. secrets\nfrom an unknown espionage source that it neither recruited nor\ncontrolled, such as Hanssen, it would obviously have little hesitancy\nin acquiring the secrets that Snowden had stolen of his own volition,\neven if Snowden had acted for idealistic reasons.\nIf Russian intelligence focused its search pattern on disgruntled\nAmerican intelligence workers, such as Ames, it is plausible that it\nspotted Snowden through his Internet rants against U.S. surveillance.\nEven if it had missed Snowden in Hawaii, a disgruntled former\ncivilian employee at the NSA would have received its full attention\nafter he contacted Russian officials in Hong Kong. While the tactics\nof the SVR might have changed since Cherkashin retired, its objectives\nremained the same. And the NSA remained its principal target.\nNor is there any reason to doubt that it still measures success in its\nability to obtain, by whatever means, the secret sources and methods\nof its adversaries. Snowden was in a position, with both the documents\nhe had taken and the knowledge he had in his head, to deliver\nthe KGB such a coup.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 264\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nc h a p t e r 26\nThe Handler\nAs for [Snowden’s] communication with the outside world, yes, I\nam his main contact.\n— anatoly kucherena, Moscow, 2013\nOn november 1, I still had not been able to make contact with\nAnatoly Kucherena, and my flight back to New York was in five\ndays. My fixer, Zamir, had been trying to arrange an appointment\nfor three weeks, but he had only received one callback from Kucherena’s\nassistant, Valentina Kvirvova. She wanted to know how I knew\nOliver Stone. Zamir told her of my part in Stone’s movie. That was\nthe last he had heard from her. Meanwhile, a Moscow- based journalist\ntold me that she had waited eighteen months to hear back from\nKucherena before giving up. I also learned from a Russian researcher\nthat Kucherena had not given a single interview since his television\ninterview with Sophie Shevardnadze on September 23, 2013. And\nno Russian journalist, or any Moscow- based foreign journalist, had\never obtained an interview with Snowden. At this point, Zamir was\nbecoming increasingly doubtful about my getting access to either\nKucherena or Snowden.\nI turned to another contact in Moscow. When I had been investigating\nthe 2006 polonium poisoning of the former KGB officer\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 265\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n266 | how america lost its secrets\nAlexander Litvinenko, I had interviewed Andrei Lugovoy. A former\nKGB officer assigned to protecting the Kremlin’s top members in the\n1990s, Lugovoy later opened his own security company. In 2005, he\nbecame a business associate of Litvinenko’s in gathering information\nand made regular trips to London to meet with him. Because\nhe had tea with Litvinenko at the Pine Bar of the Millennium Hotel\nin London on November 1, 2006, the day Litvinenko was poisoned,\nhe became the main suspect in the British investigation. He could\nnot be extradited, however. After reconstructing the chronology of\nthe crime, I established that Litvinenko had been contaminated with\npolonium at a Japanese restaurant some four hours before his tea\nwith Lugovoy. I therefore wrote that the crime scene might not have\nbeen at the Pine Bar, a finding that he said he greatly appreciated.\nLugovoy was elected to the Duma in 2007 and also hosted a\ntwenty- four- part television series on espionage for which Putin personally\ndecorated him. He was also now reputed to be in the inner\ncircle of power in Moscow. So I called him.\nWe arranged to meet in the bar of the Hotel National. A short\nbut well- built man with a bullet- style haircut, Lugovoy showed\nup promptly at 1:00 p.m. After discussing some of the subsequent\ndevelopments in the still- lingering polonium investigation, I asked\nhim if he knew Kucherena.\n“I don’t know him, but I know someone who does,” he answered.\n“Why are you interested in seeing Kucherena?”\nI told him that I wanted to speak to him about Snowden but I had\nbeen unable to arrange a meeting.\n“That’s no problem,” he said, raising his cell phone (which never\nleft his hand). He hit a number on the speed dial and spoke rapidly\nin Russian (which I do not understand). He cupped his hand over the\nphone and asked how long I would be in Moscow. After I told him\nthat I was leaving that Friday, he spoke again in Russian to the person\non the other end. “You will have an appointment on Thursday,”\nhe said.\nLater that afternoon, Valentina, Kucherena’s assistant, called to\nsay that Kucherena would be happy to see me at his office at 6:00 p.m.\non Thursday. I didn’t ask Lugovoy whom he had called. Whomever\nLugovoy called obviously had the power to arrange the meeting.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 266\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Handler | 267\nWhen I arrived at Kucherena’s office, I was with my translator\nZamir. (Kucherena did not speak English.) I arrived ten minutes\nearly, and a receptionist showed me into a well- lit square room\nwith an elegant table in the center. There was a sumptuous basket\nof exotic fruits on the table and large portraits of racehorses on the\nwalls. Another door opened, and a tall, graceful woman came into the\nroom and introduced herself as Valentina. She was wearing a wellfitting\nblack dress, a striking jade necklace, and high heels. When\nshe asked whether we would like anything to drink, it seemed more\nlike the prelude to an elegant dinner party than an interview about\nSnowden.\nValentina spoke very good English. She apologized for the delay\nin responding to my requests, explaining that she received “thousands\nof requests” for interviews and did not have time to answer\nthem. When I asked how many were answered, she shrugged and\nsaid, “Not many.”\nAt that moment, Kucherena entered with a jaunty step, a cherubic\nface, and untamed white hair. He was wearing gray slacks, a partially\nbuttoned cashmere polo sweater, and a fully engaging smile.\nAs I had learned from his entry in Wikipedia, he was born in a\nsmall village in the Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldavia in 1960\nand had obtained his law degree from the All- Union Correspondence\nLaw Institute in 1991. He opened his own law firm in Moscow\nin 1995. Kucherena’s well- known friendship with Putin had\nevidently not hurt his law practice. His clients had included such\nwell- connected defendants as Viktor Yanukovych, the president of\nUkraine overthrown in 2014; Grigory Leps, a Russian singer blacklisted\nby the United States for allegedly acting as a money courier\nfor a Eurasian criminal organization; Valentine Kovalev, a former\nRussian minister of justice charged with corruption; and Suleyman\nKerimov, a civil servant from Dagestan who had amassed an estimated\nfortune of $7.1 billion. Kerimov had recently been charged\nfor manipulating the price of potash in Belarus. Most of these clients\nwere reputed to be part of Putin’s inner circle.\nTo break the ice, I asked Kucherena about Oliver Stone. I knew\nhe had a small role in Stone’s forthcoming movie, in which he plays\nSnowden’s lawyer in Moscow.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 267\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n268 | how america lost its secrets\n“I was impressed by how few takes he needed to shoot my scene,”\nhe answered.\n“How did you come to be Snowden’s lawyer?” I asked.\n“Snowden picked me from a roster of fifteen lawyers with which\nhe had been provided.”\nBecause Snowden did not speak or read Russian, I asked Kucherena\nabout how Snowden had come to pick him from the roster. Could\nhe have known about his connections?\n“I suppose it was because of my record in defending human\nrights,” Kucherena replied with a broad smile.\nKucherena went to Sheremetyevo International Airport to meet\nhis new client on the morning of Friday, July 12, 2013. At that point,\nhe said that Snowden had been held virtually incommunicado for\ntwenty days. Other than Russian officials, the only person he had\nbeen allowed to see during this period was Assange’s aide, Sarah\nHarrison.\n“Where in the airport did you meet him?” I asked. “Was it in a\nVIP lounge?”\n“It was in the transit zone,” he replied coyly. “That is all I can say.”\nThey spoke through a translator. By this time, Harrison had sent\ntwenty- one countries petitions for asylum that were signed by\nSnowden. Whatever their purpose, Kucherena did not consider them\nhelpful.\n“I told him that if he wanted to get sanctuary in Russia, he would\nhave to immediately withdraw all the petitions in which he had\nasked other countries for asylum.” Kucherena said that otherwise he\ncould not represent him. Snowden agreed to that condition.\nShortly before 5:00 p.m., Kucherena accompanied Snowden, who\nwas wearing an open- neck blue shirt and a badly creased jacket, to\narea G9 in the transit zone, where they emerged from a door marked\n“Authorized Personnel Only.” A number of officials in dark suits,\nwho Kucherena assumed were from the “special services” to protect\nSnowden, were already in the room. Snowden and Harrison seated\nthemselves at a table. A Russian translator was also seated at the\ntable. At this point, thirteen invitees were ushered into the room\nto witness Snowden’s first public appearance in Russia. It was rare\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 268\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Handler | 269\nif not unprecedented for an American intelligence worker to seek\nasylum in Russia.\nThese invitees included some of Putin’s close associates, progovernment\nactivists, and representatives of both Amnesty International\nand Human Rights Watch. “It was totally bizarre,” said\nTanya Lokshina, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch, who\nattended. “Although it was billed as a press conference,” she recalled,\n“there was no press or photographers allowed in the room.” Nor was\nanyone allowed to photograph or record the event.\nSnowden read from a prepared statement accusing the U.S. government\nof violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nsaying he was a victim of political persecution, and concluding, “I\nwill be submitting my request to Russia today [for asylum], and\nhope it will be accepted favorably.” After answering a few questions\nposed by the audience, he left the room with Kucherena and Harrison\nby the same door they had entered.\nIn discussing this meeting, Kucherena told me that Snowden had\nnot intended to seek asylum in Russia when he arrived on June 23.\nBecause he also said he had not met Snowden prior to the day of the\nconference, I asked how he knew Snowden’s intentions.\n“When I accepted the case, I received Snowden’s dossier,” he\nanswered. “I was able to see all his interviews.”\nPresumably, Snowden’s dossier included his interviews with the\nFSB, the SVR, and other Russian security services. If so, it would\nexplain how Kucherena could be so certain that Snowden had\nbrought “material” with him to Russia that he had not provided to\njournalists in Hong Kong. Before meeting with Kucherena, I had\nmet with Sophie Shevardnadze, who told me that Kucherena had\npersonally approved the translation of their interview into English.\nSo I asked Kucherena about the interview. It will be recalled that in\nresponse to a question about whether Snowden had secret material\nwith him in Russia, Kucherena had said “certainly.” Was this\nexchange accurate?\n“It was accurate,” he answered.\nSnowden, as we know, had said in Hong Kong that he had only\ngiven journalists some of the state secrets he had stolen and that he\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 269\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n270 | how america lost its secrets\ndeemed others too sensitive for journalists. So I wanted to find out\nfrom Kucherena which documents Snowden had taken to Russia. I\nwent about it in a roundabout way. When Shevardnadze asked him\nabout the secret material Snowden might reveal in Russia, Kucherena\npointedly called her attention to Snowden’s CIA service, suggesting\nthat he might possess CIA files. I also knew that in Kucherena’s\nroman à clef, he had Joshua Frost, the thinly veiled Snowden- based\ncharacter, steal a vast number of CIA documents that could do great\ndamage to U.S. intelligence. By retaining them, Frost made himself\na prime target of the CIA.\nSo I asked, “Is Joshua Frost fact or fiction?”\n“I can’t tell you that,” he said. “If I said he was Snowden, it would\nviolate the attorney- client privilege.”\n“I understand,” I said. “But did Snowden do what Frost did in\nyour book?”\n“That is for you to decide,” he answered with a sly smile. “It’s my\nfirst novel.”\nWhen I asked if he could arrange for me to see Snowden, he\nsaid that first I would have to submit my questions to Ben Wizner,\nSnowden’s American lawyer at the ACLU. He made it clear to me\nthat the exposure of Snowden to journalists, or at least the vetting of\njournalists, had been outsourced to Wizner. Kucherena was handling\nSnowden’s liaisons with the Russian authorities while Wizner was\nhandling the Snowden narrative, including selecting the media outlets.\nPresumably, Wizner had handpicked Snowden’s past interviewers\nin Moscow, including Barton Gellmna, James Bamford, Brian\nWilliams, John Oliver, Alan Rusbridger, and Katrina vanden Heuvel.\n“After that, the final decision is up to Snowden,” he said. That\nseemed to conclude the interview, but as I got up to leave, he added,\n“His legal defense is fairly expensive.”\nSnowden had said in a BBC interview in 2015, as previously mentioned,\nthat he had brought enough cash to Hong Kong and Russia\nto cover all of his expenses. So I asked Kucherena if Snowden had\nbrought his own funds.\n“He was penniless when he arrived,” he replied. I found that\nanswer plausible because the FBI reportedly had not found a large\ncash withdrawal from his account before his departure and it seemed\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 270\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Handler | 271\nto me too risky for him to carry a large sum of undeclared cash\nthrough three airports. Because large sums of cash must be declared,\nthe detection of the money could compromise his plan to deliver his\nNSA documents. Snowden might have told the BBC he had brought\ncash to allay suspicions about who was financing his stay in Moscow.\nI was intrigued by this remark. Snowden, as far as I knew, didn’t\nneed a legal defense, because he was not charged with a crime in\nRussia and the United States had no extradition treaty with Russia.\nWhile Kucherena unfortunately did not arrange an interview with\nSnowden, he did something I considered more important. He confirmed\nthe accuracy of his September 2013 assertion that Snowden\nhad brought secret material to Russia, material he had not given to\njournalists in Hong Kong. After what I had learned from Cherkashin\nabout the lengths that Russian intelligence would go to obtain U.S.\ncommunications intelligence secrets, I viewed Snowden’s access to\nthis material to be a crucially important part of the mystery.\nThat day, I immediately sent my questions to Ben Wizner, and I\noffered to fly back to Moscow if Snowden would grant me an interview.\nIn March 2016, Wizner answered that Snowden had “respectfully\ndeclined.”\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 271\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 272\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\npart five\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWALKING THE CAT BACK\nIn solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able\nto reason backward.\n— sherlock holmes, A Study in Scarlet\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 273\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 274\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nc h a p t e r 27\nSnowden’s Choices\nIt is the choices we make that show who we truly are.\n— j. k. rowling, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone\nRussian authorities had the opportunity to thoroughly\ndebrief Snowden as to his motive for stealing state secrets,\nwhereas U.S. authorities did not. It cannot be assumed that he had\na single consistent motive in 2013. Snowden has shown, if nothing\nelse, that he was adaptable to changing circumstances. He might have\nbegun taking documents for one reason and found other reasons as\nhe proceeded in his quest. Many of the reported circumstances of his\nactivities, including his probes, contacts, theft, and escape, are disputed\nby his supporters. Many of his other activities are shrouded\nby the secrecy of the NSA. We do know, though, that Snowden made\nfour extraordinary choices during the nine- month period in 2013. If,\nas is said, actions speak louder than words, Snowden’s four choices\nilluminate the underlying concerns guiding his acts. In the case of a\nclassified intelligence breach, as in the post- action analysis of a masterful\nchess game, the sequence of moves a player makes provides an\nimportant clue to his strategy. Let us review what we have already\nlearned about these decisions.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 275\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n276 | how america lost its secrets\nThe First Decision\nThe initial move that Snowden made in preparation for the Level 3\nbreach was switching jobs on March 15. Snowden chose to leave his\njob as a system administrator at Dell to take one at Booz Allen as an\nanalyst in training. His motive could not have been money, because\nit was a lower- paying position. At the time he made this choice, he\nhad already set up an encrypted channel with Laura Poitras for the\npurpose of sending her secret material. But he did not have to change\njobs to send her important secrets. So what was his purpose in making\nthis fateful choice?\nThe job change was not necessary to expose NSA domestic activities.\nIf he had only wanted to be a whistle- blower, there were ample\ndocuments about the NSA’s activities already available to him on\nthe NSANet. He also had access at Dell to the administrative file\nthat contained the FISA court orders issued every three months to\nVerizon. In addition, as the NSA’s damage assessment established,\nbefore switching jobs, Snowden had already taken most of the documents\npertaining to the NSA’s domestic operations that he could\nhave supplied to Poitras and Greenwald for whistle- blowing purposes.\nIndeed, while still at Dell, he had told Poitras he had a copy\nof Presidential Policy Directive 20, a document in which President\nObama authorized the NSA to tap into fiber cables crossing the\nUnited States. Snowden described it to her as “a kind of martial law\nfor cyber operations, created by the White House.” True, he took a\nmore recently issued FISA order and PRISM presentation in April\nafter switching jobs, but he could just as easily have taken the January\n2013 version of the FISA order from the administrative file of\nDell. It would have had the same explosive effect in the media.\nNor did he switch jobs to lessen the risk of getting caught. Actually,\nthe change put him in far greater jeopardy. At Dell, he was relatively\nsafe from apprehension because he could take documents,\nsuch as the Presidential Policy Directive 20, from access points at\nthe NSA shared by many of his peers, making it difficult to trace the\ntheft. Indeed, if he just wanted to expose the NSA’s domestic operations,\nhe could have done the entire operation at Dell. He could even\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 276\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nSnowden’s Choices | 277\nhave sent Poitras documents anonymously over his own Tor software\nand server. And he could have remained in his self- described\n“paradise” in Hawaii with his girlfriend.\nWhen he chose to move to Booz Allen, the risk of exposure\ngreatly increased because of its auditing system. Any documents he\ntook without authorization could be traced back to him (though not\nin real time). As he later told Greenwald and Poitras, he knew that\nstealing documents at the Booz Allen job meant that he would either\ngo to prison or escape from America. He didn’t want to face prison\ntime, so the job change required an escape plan. As part of that plan,\nsoon after he started work at the Booz Allen– managed facility, he\nsubmitted a request for a medical leave of absence.\nWe can safely assume that the reason he made this risky switch\nin employment was that he wanted something beyond the whistleblowing\ndocuments. He wanted documents that were not available\nat the Dell job. One such document he took was the top secret\nCongressional Budget Justification book for fiscal year 2013. This\n“black budget,” as it is called in Congress, contained the entire intelligence\ncommunity’s priorities for, among other things, monitoring\nthe activities of potential adversaries and terrorist organizations.\nIt specified the money requested not only by the NSA but by the\nCIA, the DIA, the National Reconnaissance Office, and other intelligence\nservices. Snowden could not have objected to the budget’s\nbeing somehow secret or illegitimate, because it was duly approved\nby both houses of Congress and the president. If it was not for purposes\nof whistle- blowing, presumably he had another purpose for\ntaking such a document. It certainly held value to other actors. “For\nour enemies, having it [the black budget] is like having the playbook\nof the opposing NFL team,” said the former CIA deputy director\nMorell in 2015. “I guarantee you that the SVR, the Russian foreign\nintelligence service, would have paid millions of dollars for such a\ndocument.” If unlike Ames, Hanssen, and Pelton, Snowden was not\nafter acquiring money, he must have seen another value in taking it.\nThe documents he stole at Booz Allen certainly increased his\nvalue to adversary nations, because they included lists revealing the\nNSA’s sources in Russia, China, and other foreign countries.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 277\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n278 | how america lost its secrets\nSnowden wanted more than just NSA secrets. He used his new\nposition and widened access at Booz Allen to go after secret documents\nfrom the intelligence services of Britain, Australia, New\nZealand, and Israel. He revealed this operation only after receiving\nsanctuary in Russia. He told an interviewer that by moving to his\nnew Booz Allen job as an infrastructure analyst, he gained the ability\nto pry secrets out of the allies of the NSA. “I had a special level\nof clearance, called ‘Priv Ac,’ ” he said. This “priv ac” status did not\nallow him to bypass the password protection at sealed- off compartments\nat the NSA, but it did allow him to request files from foreign\nservices cooperating with U.S. intelligence.\nBy way of example, he described one file from the British GCHQ\ncipher service that he copied, stole, and provided to other parties. It\nexposed a legally authorized British operation to collect electronic\ndata on terrorist matters in Pakistan by tapping into Cisco routers\nused by telecom companies in Asia. This GCHQ operation, as\nSnowden knew, violated neither British nor American law. He told a\nBBC interviewer in regard to that file, “What’s scariest is not what\nthe government is doing that’s unlawful, but what they’re doing\nthat is completely lawful.” So his criteria for taking such documents\nwere not their illegality. In his five weeks at this Booz Allen job, he\nalso used this same newly acquired “priv ac” at the NSA to steal files\nfrom the Israeli, Canadian, and Australian intelligence services.\nJumping from one outside contracting firm to another for the\npurpose of penetrating other Western intelligence services is not\nthe conventional mission of a whistle- blower. In the parlance of CIA\ncounterintelligence, the actions of an employee of an intelligence\nservice who changes his jobs solely to steal the more valuable secrets\nof this service is called an “expanding penetration.” It is not possible\nto believe that Snowden did not know the immense damage that\nthe highly sensitive documents he was taking from the NSA and its\nallies could cause.\nHis choice to switch jobs did not come out of the blue. It was not\nbased on serendipitously discovering the documents after he began\nworking at Booz Allen. As he told Lana Lam, he knew in advance\nthat by switching to the job at Booz Allen, he would gain the opportunity\nto take the lists of NSA sources. He knew that the NSA’s\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 278\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nSnowden’s Choices | 279\nsecretive National Threat Operations Center’s chief business was, as\nits name suggests, countering direct threats from China, Russia, and\nother adversary states and that to deal with these threats, the NSA\nhad used sophisticated methods to hack into the computers of adversaries.\nThe NSA was even able to remotely gain entry to adversary\ncomputers that were not hooked into a network. “It’s no secret that\nwe hack China very aggressively,” Snowden later said from Moscow.\nHe had a planned target: getting the lists of the enemy computers\nthat the NSA had hacked into.\nHe also knew he was undertaking a dangerous enterprise. He even\nmentioned the possibility that he would be “in an orange jumpsuit,\nsuper- max prison in isolation or Guantánamo,” perhaps even\nassassinated.\nHe knowingly chose this course presumably because he believed\nthe value of the secrets he would obtain by switching jobs outweighed\nthe risk of imprisonment. Or worse. Part of his calculus\nmight have been the belief that the NSA lists, GCHQ documents,\nand other material in his possession could give him great leverage, if\nhe chose to exert it, in his future dealings with intelligence services\n(including the NSA). His choice to widen his access was made, if not\nto get rich, to empower himself.\nThe Second Decision\nThe second choice of consequence that Snowden made was to make\nHong Kong his first stop. He had many other options. He could have\nremained in America, as almost all previous whistle- blowers had\nchosen to do. If he did that, he would have to make his case in court\n(and, in that case, the Level 3 documents he took might have been\nretrieved before they fell into unauthorized hands). He could have\nalso chosen to make an escape to a country that did not have an active\nextradition treaty with the United States. He could have, for example,\ntaken a direct flight to Brazil, which has no extradition treaty\nwith the United States. Brazil also had the advantage of being the\nhome country of Glenn Greenwald, whose cooperation he sought.\nSnowden could have gone to many other countries without extradi-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 279\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n280 | how america lost its secrets\ntion treaties with the United States. Yet, instead, he flew to Hong\nKong, which had an extradition agreement that had been enforced\nthroughout the past decade with Hong Kong courts ordering the\narrest of almost every fugitive charged by U.S. authorities. He could\nexpect that when the United States filed a criminal complaint, Hong\nKong authorities would seize him and the alleged stolen property of\nthe U.S. government in his possession. Even if he were released on\nbail and successfully defeated extradition in a Hong Kong court, the\nHong Kong authorities would almost certainly retain all the NSA\nand GCHQ files he had gone to such lengths to steal.\nHis reason, as he told Greenwald, was that China could provide\nhim with physical protection from any countermeasures by U.S.\nintelligence agencies such as “American agents . . . breaking down\nthe door” of the hotel room and seizing him. China also had sway\nover Hong Kong’s security activities.\nHong Kong was therefore merely a protected stopover en route to\nhis next destination. If he had gone directly to Moscow and provided\nthe same journalists with the same documents at a press conference\nin Moscow, his status as a whistle- blower might have been viewed\nwith less sympathy in the media. Even The Guardian, for example,\nmight have been reluctant to publish a Moscow- based story revealing\nBritish and American communications intelligence secrets.\nThe Third Decision\nThe third choice Snowden made, and the choice that most effectively\ndefined him to the public, was to reveal himself as the man behind\nthe leak in a video in Hong Kong. He not only identified himself as\nthe person who stole the government documents published by The\nGuardian and The Washington Post but also incriminated himself\nfurther on camera by allowing Poitras to film him actually disclosing\nthe NSA’s secret operations to Greenwald. By disclosing classified\ndata to Greenwald, an unauthorized person, he intentionally burned\nhis bridges.\nWhat makes this choice intriguing is that there was no evident\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 280\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nSnowden’s Choices | 281\nneed for him to expose himself in this way. If he merely wanted to\nbe a whistle- blower, he could have, as Bradley Manning did, anonymously\nsent the documents to journalists as “Citizen Four.” In fact,\nin late May 2013, that was exactly what he did. He anonymously\nsent Gellman the PRISM scoop, which the Post published on June 6.\nHe also sent Greenwald and Poitras documents while he was still\nthe anonymous Citizen Four. Neither Gellman nor Greenwald had\nsuggested the need for a face- to- face meeting with Snowden. Even\nafter he had revealed his true identity to Poitras and Greenwald on\nJune 3, the Guardian editor Ewen MacAskill offered him the option\nof remaining an unnamed source for the stories. He said, as he later\ntold Vanity Fair, “You should remain anonymous; the stories are\njust as good without you.” However, anonymity was not part of\nSnowden’s long game.\nThe reason he gave Greenwald in Hong Kong for going public in\nthis way was to avoid having any suspicion fall on his co- workers at\nthe NSA. Yet in the initial stories published by Greenwald, Poitras,\nand Gellman, Snowden had not allowed the reporters to identify him\nby either name or position. If he did not act to deflect suspicion from\nhis co- workers for the initial investigation, why do it a week later?\nIn the intervening week, the FBI had already launched its criminal\ninvestigation. In any case, he did not need to be the subject of a documentary\nfilm to take sole responsibility for stealing state secrets. He\ncould have simply allowed Greenwald to identify him by name as\nthe source in the stories.\nOne thing that Snowden could not accomplish by anonymously\ntransferring the documents to journalists was a starring role in the\ndrama. If he had appeared digitally masked in Poitras’s video with\nan altered voice, he would not achieve fame. To do that, he needed to\nallow Poitras to film him committing the crime of turning over NSA\ndocuments to Greenwald. This video was also part of his advance\nplanning. Indeed, one reason he chose Poitras was that she was a\nprizewinning documentary filmmaker. Snowden, while he was still\nworking at the NSA in March 2013, made it clear how he intended\nto use Poitras’s filmmaking skills. He told her, “My personal desire is\nthat you paint the target directly on my back.” Making himself the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 281\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n282 | how america lost its secrets\non- camera star of a twenty- hour- long reality show, edited first into\na video and then a full- length documentary, transformed him in the\npublic’s mind into a hero.\nIt would be a mistake to assume that the central role he gave\nhimself was simply an exercise in narcissism. After the video was\nreleased, he was no longer a near nonentity servicing a computer\nsystem at a backwater NSA base in Hawaii. He had emerged from\nthe shadowy world of electronic intelligence to become one of the\nmost famous whistle- blowers in modern history. It was a mantle\nthat would allow him to also become a leading advocate of privacy\nand encryption rights, as well as the leading opponent of NSA spying.\nWhile this remarkable transformation might not have been his\nentire motive, it was certainly the result of the choice he made to go\npublic.\nThe Fourth Decision\nThe final choice he made was to board a nonstop flight to Moscow\non June 23. Once the U.S. criminal complaint was unsealed on June\n21, he needed to leave Hong Kong; his continued presence would\nhave been a complication for the Chinese president, Xi, scheduled\nsoon to meet President Obama. His only route out of Hong Kong\nwent through two adversaries of the United States: China and Russia.\nChina, as far as is known, did not offer him sanctuary. According\nto one U.S. diplomat cited by The New York Times, China might have\nalready obtained copies of Snowden’s NSA files and did not want the\nproblem of having Snowden defect to Beijing. In any case, if it had\nnot already acquired the files, it could assume it would receive that\nintelligence data from its Russian ally in the intelligence war. Whatever\nits reason, China did not use its considerable power in Hong\nKong to block Snowden’s exit.\nNor did Snowden obtain a visa to any country in Latin America or\nelsewhere during his monthlong stay in Hong Kong. As in the oftcited\nSherlock Holmes clue of the dog that did not bark, Snowden’s\nlack of any visas in his passport strongly suggests that he had not\nmade plans to go anyplace but where he actually went: Moscow. His\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 282\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nSnowden’s Choices | 283\nactions here, including his contacts with Russian officials in Hong\nKong, speak louder than his words.\nJust as he believed the Chinese intelligence service could protect\nhim in Hong Kong from a physical attack by agents of the United\nStates, he could assume that the FSB could protect him from them\nin Moscow. He was not entirely naive about its capabilities. During\nhis service in the CIA, he had taken a monthlong training course at\nthe CIA’s “farm” at Fort Peary, in which counterintelligence officers\ntaught about the capabilities of the Russian security services. He\ncouldn’t have believed that Russia would allow a defector from the\nNSA who claimed to have had access to the NSA’s sources in Russia\nand China to leave Moscow before its security services obtained that\ninformation.\nIt is not uncommon for a defector to change sides in order to find\na better life for himself in another country. Some defectors flee to\nescape a repressive government or to find one in which they believe\nthey are more closely attuned to its values. Russia, however, is ordinarily\nnot the country of choice for someone such as Snowden seeking\ngreater civil liberties and personal freedom. So why did Snowden\nchoose Russia for his new life?\nThe four choices just discussed that Snowden made, taken together,\nshow that Snowden was determined to succeed where others\nbefore him had failed. He not only wanted to take full credit for\nstealing files from the NSA but also wanted to escape any American\nretribution for his act. His decision suggests to me a highly intelligent,\ncarefully calculating man who was hell- bent on finding a new\nlife for himself in a foreign country. A common thread that runs\nthrough these four choices is a willingness to do whatever was necessary\nto achieve this new life, including disregarding his oath to\nprotect secrets and instead transporting them on thumb drives to\na foreign country. To protect himself, he was also willing to rely on\nthe influence of adversary intelligence services in Hong Kong and\nput himself in the hands of Russian authorities in Moscow. He was\nalso willing to use some of his classified documents as a medium of\nexchange, if not bait, with journalists to get the public attention he\nsought.\nThese choices paid off for Snowden, the new hero of millions. In\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 283\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n284 | how america lost its secrets\nMoscow, he could enjoy a safe life, free from the threats of a CIA\nrendition team dropping from the sky or extradition proceedings. He\nwas now under the protection of Putin’s Russia. The press had a field\nday with the domestic surveillance documents that he gave them. As\nfar as Snowden was concerned, as he told Gellman on December 21,\n2013, in Moscow, “The mission’s already accomplished.”\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 284\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nc h a p t e r 28\nThe Espionage Source\nThe government’s investigation failed. [It] didn’t know what was\ntaken.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2014\nIn moscow, I had learned that Russian intelligence services use\nthe broad, umbrella term “espionage source” to describe moles,\nvolunteers, and anyone else who delivers another state’s secrets\nto it. It applies not only to documents but to the secret knowledge\nthat such a source is able to recall and includes both controlled and\nuncontrolled bearers of secrets. It is also a job description that fit\nEdward Snowden in June 2013.\nUnless one is willing to believe that the Putin regime acted out of\npurely altruistic motives in exfiltrating this American intelligence\nworker to Moscow, the only plausible explanation for its actions\nin Hong Kong was that it recognized Snowden’s potential as an\nespionage source. Snowden’s open disillusionment with the NSA\npresented the very situation that the Russian intelligence services\nspecialized in exploiting. He had also revealed to reporters in Hong\nKong that he had deliberately gained access to the NSA’s sources\nand methods and that he had taken highly classified documents to\nHong Kong. He further disclosed that before leaving the NSA, he\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 285\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n286 | how america lost its secrets\nhad gained access to the lists of computers that the NSA had penetrated\nin foreign countries. He even went so far as to describe to\nthese journalists the secrets that he had taken as a “single point of\nfailure” for the NSA. And aside from the documents he had copied,\nhe claimed that the secret knowledge in his head, if he disclosed it,\nwould wreak havoc on U.S. intelligence. “If I were providing information\nthat I know, that’s in my head, to some foreign government,\nthe US intelligence community would . . . see sources go dark that\nwere previously productive,” he told the editor of The Guardian in\nMoscow.\nIn short, he advertised possessing priceless data that the Russian\nintelligence services had been seeking, with little success, for\nthe past six decades. These electronic files could provide it with the\nkeys to unlock the NSA’s entire kingdom of electronic spying. Could\nany world- class intelligence service ignore such a prize? To miss the\nopportunity to get its hands on such a potential espionage source\nwould be nothing short of gross negligence.\nIn fact, this golden opportunity was not missed in Hong Kong.\nEven if the Russian intelligence service had not previously had\nhim in its sights— which, as discussed earlier, appears to me to be\nextremely unlikely— he made contact with Russian officials in Hong\nKong, and Putin personally approved allowing Snowden to come to\nRussia.\nThis decision made it possible for Snowden, without an entry\nvisa to Russia, or, for that matter, any other country, to check in\nand board an Aeroflot flight to Moscow. We also know that a special\noperation was mounted to take Snowden off the plane once it landed\nin Moscow. Such an operation could not have been executed without\nadvance planning. Nor would he be removed from the plane without\na plan for his stay in Russia. Once Putin approved it, there is little\nreason to doubt that the plans to get Snowden to Moscow, and whatever\ncover stories were deemed necessary to obscure them, had been\ncarried out professionally by Russia’s special services.\nWhen an intelligence service makes such elaborate preparations\nfor extracting a foreign intelligence worker, it presumably also\nexpects to debrief him or her on arrival. Pelton, for example, who\nhad access to far less valuable information than had Snowden, was\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 286\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Espionage Source | 287\nheld incommunicado in Vienna for two weeks during his debriefing.\nIt would be inconceivable for an intelligence service to bring\na potential espionage source such as Snowden to Russia and allow\nhim to catch the next plane to Latin America. The false report provided\nto the press that Snowden was flying there was likely nothing\nmore than a smoke screen to confuse foreign observers while he was\nreceiving his initial debriefing and evaluation.\nWhen it comes to the esoteric enterprise of reconstructing the\nwork of U.S. communications intelligence, military as well as civilian\nexperts in cryptology, computer sciences, and communications are\nnecessary. Unlike in the case of Pelton, Snowden, according to Anatoly\nKucherena, had secret material in his possession. Even if Russian\nintelligence had already acquired copies of the electronic files\nprior to Snowden’s arrival in Moscow, Snowden’s interpretation of\nthem would be part of the debriefing because intelligence data needs\nto be put in context.\n“This debriefing could not be done overnight,” according to a former\nhigh- ranking officer in the GRU, the Russian military intelligence\nservice. “There is no way that Snowden would not be fully\ndebriefed,” he said. He also said GRU specialists in signals intelligence\nwould be called in.\nPutin’s approval of the Snowden operation was not without consequences.\nNot only did Obama make good on his threat to cancel\nthe pre- Olympics summit with Putin, but also, as it turned out,\nthe Snowden exfiltration proved a turning point in the “reset” of\nU.S.- Russian relations. Having to accept the onus of declining relations\nwith the Obama administration, Putin, it seems safe to assume,\nattempted to get the bonus of the NSA’s communications intelligence\nfrom Snowden. The GRU, the SVR, and other Russian intelligence\nservices would not stop questioning Snowden, even if it took\nyears, until they had squeezed out of him whatever state secrets he\nhad. Because Snowden was rewarded with sanctuary, a residence, and\nbodyguards, there is no reason to doubt that he refused to accommodate\nhis hosts. While he might continue to see himself as a whistleblower\non a supranational scale, as far as Russian intelligence was\nconcerned, he was an espionage source.\nFor an intelligence service, the game is not over when it obtains\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 287\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n288 | how america lost its secrets\nstate secrets. It still needs to fog over the extent of its coup, as said\nearlier, to prolong the value of the espionage. Hence it is likely that\nthe story that Snowden had thoroughly destroyed all the stolen\ndata in the month prior to departing for Russia, as well as the story\nthat he had turned down all requests to be questioned by the FSB\nand other Russian intelligence officials, was part of the legend constructed\nfor him. The repetitions of these uncorroborated claims in\nhis press interviews might also have enhanced his public image for\nthe ACLU effort to get clemency for him. Even so, in view of the\nimportance of such communications intelligence to Russia, it would\nbe the height of naïveté for U.S. or British intelligence to accept such\nclaims as anything more than camouflage.\nAs for Snowden’s motive, I see no reason to doubt his explanation\nthat he stole NSA documents to expose its surveillance because\nhe believed that it was an illicit intrusion into the privacy of individuals.\nSuch disaffection is not a unique situation in the intelligence\nbusiness. Many of Russia’s worldwide espionage sources before\nSnowden were also dissatisfied employees who had access to classified\nsecrets. Like some of them, Snowden used his privileged access\nto reveal what he considered the improper activities of the organization\nfor which he worked. In that sense, I fully accept that he began\nas a whistle- blower, not as a spy. It was also as a whistle- blower that\nhe contacted Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald, and Barton Gellman,\nwho published the scoops he provided in Der Spiegel, The Guardian,\nand The Washington Post.\nSnowden’s penetration went beyond whistle- blowing, however.\nIn the vast number of files he copied were documents that contained\nthe NSA’s most sensitive sources and methods that had little if anything\nto do with domestic surveillance or whistle- blowing.\nSnowden could not have acted entirely alone. It will be recalled\nthat the deepest part of his penetration was during the five weeks\nhe worked at the National Threat Operations Center in Hawaii as\na contract employee of Booz Allen Hamilton. It was there that he\ncopied Level 3 files, including the so- called road map to the gaps\nin American intelligence. During this period, Snowden had neither\nthe passwords nor the system administrator’s privileges that would\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 288\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe Espionage Source | 289\nallow him to copy, transfer, and steal the electronic files. He therefore\nmust have obtained that assistance from someone who had the\npasswords and privileges. Other workers there might have shared\nhis sensibilities and antipathy toward NSA surveillance. It therefore\nseems entirely plausible that he found a co- worker willing to\ncooperate or, vice versa, a co- worker found him. Snowden might\nnot have been aware of his new accomplice’s true motives or affiliations,\nbut without some co- worker’s providing him with entry to\nthe sealed- off computers, he could not have carried out the penetration.\nTo our knowledge, whoever helped him evidently did not want\nto expose himself to prosecution or defect from the NSA. That was\nSnowden’s role. By accepting the sole blame in the video that Poitras\nmade about him in Hong Kong, Snowden shielded anyone else from\nsuspicion, which was, as he told Poitras, his purpose. Whoever helped\nhim may still be working at the NSA.\nTo be sure, there remains that other glaring gap in the chain of\nevents that led Snowden to Moscow: his whereabouts and activities\nduring his first eleven days in Hong Kong. Mike Rogers, the\nchairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, even suggested,\nwithout any evidence, that Snowden might have been taken\nto mainland China during this period. What drove his speculation\nwas the admission of U.S. intelligence that despite its vast global\nresources for searching credit card charges, banking transactions,\nhotel registrations, e- mails, police records, and even CCTV cameras,\nneither it nor its allies were able to find a trace of Snowden during\nthat time. It was, in a phrase made famous by the former secretary\nof defense Donald Rumsfeld, “a known unknown.” Just as likely he\ncould have been staying in a well- prepared safe house anywhere in\nHong Kong or even at the home of an unknown associate. All that is\nreally known is that soon after he emerged from this venue, moved\nto the Mira hotel, and gave his celebrated interview to journalists, he\nwas safely settled in Russia.\nSnowden’s actions appear squarely at odds with his assertions of\nserving his country’s interests. Even accepting that he began with a\nsincere desire to be a world- class whistle- blower, his mission evolved,\ndeliberately or not, into one that led him to disclose key communica-\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 289\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n290 | how america lost its secrets\ntions intelligence secrets to a foreign power with an agenda that is\nhardly aligned with his country’s interests. A defector is defined in\nthe Cambridge English Dictionary as “a person who leaves his or her\nown country or group to join an opposing one.” Snowden’s actions\nfit that description. In the end, it is Snowden’s actions, not his words,\nthat matter.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 290\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nc h a p t e r 29\nThe “War on Terror” After Snowden\nBecause of a number of unauthorized disclosures and a lot of\nhand- wringing over the government’s role in the effort to try to\nuncover these terrorists, there have been some policy and legal\nand other actions that make our ability collectively, internationally,\nto find these terrorists much more challenging.\n— cia director john brennan,\nin response to the Paris terrorist attack, November 2015\nOn the evening of November 13, 2015, nine jihadist terrorists\nacting on behalf of ISIS brought normal life in Paris to a\nscreeching halt. Three suicide bombers blew themselves up at the\nstadium at Saint- Denis while President Hollande was inside attending\na match between France and Germany. Other terrorists that\nnight killed 130 people at cafés, restaurants, and a theater. Three\nhundred and eighty- eight others were wounded in the carnage.\nAbdelhamid Abaaoud, a twenty- eight- year- old Belgian citizen of\nMoroccan origins who served ISIS as a logistics officer in Syria in\n2014, planned the attack over many months with the help of others\nin Syria. To organize it, they smuggled three suicide bombers into\nEurope through Greece, raised financing, set up a base in the Molenbeek\nsection of Brussels, imported deactivated assault weapons from\nSlovenia that were restored by a technician, bought ammunition,\nacquired suicide vests, obtained “burner” cell phones, rented cars,\nand, two months before the attack, rented three additional apartments\nunder fake identities to conceal the operation. Finally, in\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 291\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n292 | how america lost its secrets\nNovember, they made online bookings for quarters in Paris for the\nnine attackers. Even though Abaaoud was well- known to Western\nintelligence services, none of the communications surrounding the\npreparations for the attack came to the attention of the NSA or its\nallied services in Europe. A critical find for the investigators enabled\nthem to unravel the chain that eventually led them to the perpetrators,\nbut it had nothing to do with electronic surveillance. A cell\nphone belonging to one of them was found by the security forces,\nfollowing a broad search they conducted, which included trash cans\nsituated in the vicinity of the concert halls. So this breakthrough in\nthe investigation had nothing to do with systematic data analysis\nconducted prior to the attack.\nIndeed, in the sequence of the Paris events, as in other terror\nevents, the challenge is not just bringing culprits to justice. It is preventing\nthe terrorists from carrying out their attack to begin with.\nPolice cannot constantly protect “soft targets” such as restaurants,\ncafés, theaters, and street gatherings. The only practical means by\nwhich a government can prevent such attacks is to learn in advance\ntheir planning and preparations. One means of acquiring this information\nis by listening in on the channels through which members\nof loosely knit terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, communicate.\nThis form of intelligence gathering obviously works best so long\nas the terrorists remain unaware that the communication channels\nthey are using are being monitored. Once they find out that their\nmessages and conversations are being intercepted, they will likely\nfind a safer means to communicate important information. For that\nreason, communications intelligence organizations keep the sources\nand methods they employ for monitoring these channels in a tightly\nsealed envelope of secrecy.\nYet, in June 2013, the NSA found that envelope had been breached\nby Snowden, who knowingly compromised three programs that it\nused to keep track of terrorist organizations around the world. The\nfirst system he divulged, and the one that received the most public\nattention, was what the NSA called the “215” program because it\nhad been authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act of 2001. This\nprogram compiled the billing records of every phone call made in\nAmerica. The data included the number called and the duration of\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 292\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe “War on Terror” After Snowden | 293\nthe call but not the name of the caller. This anonymous data was\narchived into a huge database. The idea was that when any foreigner\non the FBI’s watch list of terrorists called any number in the United\nStates, the FBI could trace that person’s entire chain of telephone\ncontacts to try to determine if he or she was connected to a known\nterrorist cell. There was, however, a major flaw in this program: it\ndid not cover e- mail and other Internet messaging, which by 2013\nhad largely replaced telephone calls. In addition, terrorist organizations,\nafter the tracking down of Osama bin Laden in 2011, had\nbecome fully aware of the vulnerability of telephoning overseas. So\nalthough the NSA could cite a handful of early successes that “215”\nyielded, Snowden’s exposure of it did only limited damage.\nSnowden did vastly more damage by revealing the PRISM program,\nalso called “702” because it was authorized in 2008 by Section\n702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Its effectiveness\nproceeded from the misplaced confidence that terrorist organizations\nin Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan had in the encryption and\nother safeguards used by giant Internet companies, such as Apple,\nGoogle, Twitter, and WhatsApp. They evidently had not known\nthat in 2007 the NSA found a way to intercept this data before it\nwas encrypted. The Internet, despite metaphors such as “the cloud”\nand “cyberspace,” initially travels through fiber cables, almost all of\nwhich run through the United States and its Five Eyes allies. So by\n2013 the NSA was able to access 91 percent of the Internet before\nit was encrypted. This so- called upstream data included Google\nsearches, tweets on Twitter, social media postings, Skype conversations,\nmessages on Xbox Live, instant messages sent over WhatsApp,\nand e- mails sent via the Internet. The NSA could also read concealed\nmessages in photographs and online game moves. According to a\ndeclassified 2015 inspector general’s analysis, the actual interceptions\nin this program in 2013 were mainly limited to the communications\nof preselected foreign terrorists.\nUntil the Snowden breach was revealed on June 6, 2013, this program\ngave U.S. intelligence a valuable tool for gathering unexpected\nintelligence. Snowden must have been aware of how highly the NSA\nvalued this program because, according to the documents he released,\nPRISM was “the number one source of raw intelligence used for\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 293\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n294 | how america lost its secrets\nNSA analytic reports.” From the continued use of these intercepted\nchannels by suspected terrorists on the NSA’s watch lists, it could\nbe reasonably assumed that these users were unaware of the NSA’s\ncapacity to intercept their messages on the unencrypted Internet.\nUnlike the telephone program that Snowden revealed, the PRISM\nprogram produced actionable intelligence until the time when\nSnowden blew it. General Hayden, who was NSA director during\nthe three years following the 9/11 attack, wrote that these surveillance\npowers, among other things, “uncovered illicit financing networks,\ndetected suspect travel, discovered ties to aviation schools,\nlinked transportation employees to associates of terrorists, drew\nconnections to the illicit purchases of arms, tied U.S. persons to Khalid\nSheikh Mohammed, and discovered a suspect terrorist on the\nno-fly list who was already in the United States.” More specifically,\njust between 2007 and 2013, according to the testimony of NSA and\nFBI officials, it resulted in the preempting of at least forty-five terrorist\nattacks. Almost all of the thwarted attacks occurred outside\nthe jurisdiction of the United States, and therefore did not result in\nU.S. prosecutions. One of the plots that targeted Americans was a\nplanned attack using high explosives on the subways in Grand Central\nstation and the Times Square station at rush hour in New York\nCity in 2009. It was averted after British intelligence supplied the\nNSA with the e- mail address of the terrorist suspect Najibullah Zazi\nin Aurora, Colorado. The PRISM surveillance program then traced it\nto an IP address on the watch list associated with Rashid Rauf, an al-\nQaeda bomb maker in Pakistan. Zazi, evidently unaware that e- mails\nsent via Yahoo! could be intercepted before they were encrypted\nby Yahoo!, continued sending e- mails to Rauf as he prepared to\nassemble the bombs in early September 2009. As a result, the NSA\nsearch of its database yielded e- mails from Zazi discussing the proportions\nof explosives to be used. These e- mails recovered through\nthe PRISM program, according to an analysis done for the Senate\nJudiciary Committee in 2014, provided the “critical lead” that led to\nthe arrest of Zazi and his confederates before they could detonate\nbombs in the subways of New York City. The members of the House\nand Senate Select Committees on Intelligence had no doubt that the\n702 program played a key role in aborting this plot they had been\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 294\n9/30/16 11:09 AM\nThe “War on Terror” After Snowden | 295\nsecretly briefed on in 2009. Dianne Feinstein, the chair of the Senate\nSelect Committee, pointed out with privileged knowledge that it\nsaved “subway cars stuffed to the gunwales with people”; Representative\nMike Rogers also spoke with privileged knowledge when he\nsaid on June 9, 2013, referring to the 702 program, “I can tell you in\nthe Zazi case in New York, it’s exactly the program that was used.”\nThe third NSA program of interest to terrorists that Snowden\nrevealed was called XKeyscore. Using Internet data from PRISM, the\nNSA had created the equivalent of digital fingerprints for suspected\nforeign terrorists on watch lists. The “fingerprint” for each suspect\nwas based on his or her search pattern on the Internet. These algorithms\nmade it difficult for suspects to hide on the Internet by using\naliases. Once a suspect was “fingerprinted,” any attempt to evade\nsurveillance by using a different computer and another user name\nwould be detected by the XKeyscore algorithms. The “fingerprints”\nonly worked so long as XKeyscore remained secret from those on\nthe watch list. After Snowden exposed it, suspects could evade surveillance\nby changing their search patterns when they changed their\naliases.\nFurther enabling furtive Internet users to evade the surveillance\nof the government, Snowden offered specific tips about the secret\nsources and methods used by both the NSA and the British GCHQ.\nHe revealed in a public interview, for example, that the GCHQ\nhad deployed the first “full- take” Internet interceptor that “snarfs\neverything, in a rolling buffer to allow retroactive investigation\nwithout missing a single bit.” When asked how to circumvent it,\nhe replied, “You should never route through or peer with the UK\nunder any circumstances. Their fibers are radioactive, and even the\nQueen’s selfies to the pool boy get logged.” Aside from this warning\nabout using Internet providers whose wiring passes through Britain,\nhe also warned Internet users about trusting the encryption of any\nU.S.- based Internet company because of their secret relationships\nwith the NSA. He added that the NSA considered “telecom collaborators\nto be the jewels in their crown of omniscience.” He also gave a\nwarning about the attention the NSA was paying to “jihadi forums.”\nHe said that to avoid being automatically “targeted” by the NSA,\none needed to avoid them.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 295\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n296 | how america lost its secrets\nThese precise tips for evading U.S. and British surveillance were\nnot accidentally leaked. Snowden supplied them in written answers\nto interrogatives sent to him by Poitras and Appelbaum in May\n2013 while he was still on the NSA payroll. He also carefully orchestrated\nthe exposure of the PRISM surveillance programs, precisely\nspecifying, as Greenwald writes in his book No Place to Hide, who\nwas to release the “scoops” in which newspapers. He gave Gellman a\nseventy- two- hour ultimatum for exposing PRISM, as we know. He\nfurther provided Poitras with well- organized files for publications\nrevealing, among other things, that the NSA had paid RSA, a leading\ncomputer security provider, to build flawed encryption protocols,\nwhich allowed the NSA to read encrypted messages on computers\nand online video games. In short, he used these journalists to accomplish\nhis purpose. In light of the way he micromanaged the leaks, it is\ndifficult to conclude that he did not deliberately plan to compromise\nand render useless these U.S. and British operations.\nWhatever he intended, he clearly succeeded in blowing the cover\noff NSA’s operations authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nAct for monitoring terrorists’ activities. After all, terrorist\ngroups are no different from other criminal enterprises in their need\nto keep their communications secret from the authorities pursuing\nthem. If they find out that the police are tapping their phone lines or\nintercepting other channels of communication, they can be expected\nto either stop using them or use them to divert attention away from\ntheir real plans.\nIn addition, Snowden suggested an alternative means to those who\nwanted to evade government surveillance. He recommended that\nthey use end- to- end encryption, which results in messages being\nencrypted before they are sent over the Internet. He told Greenwald,\nfor example, that encryption was “critically necessary” for anyone\nto evade NSA surveillance. Just as Robert Hanssen had deliberately\ncompromised the NSA’s interception of Soviet communications in\nWashington, D.C., in the 1990s, Snowden deliberately compromised\nthe NSA’s interception of concealed messages by potential terrorists\non the Internet. We cannot know whether or not any of the jihadists\ninvolved in subsequent terrorist attacks (such as those in Paris or\nSan Bernardino, California, in 2015) would have used the Internet\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 296\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nThe “War on Terror” After Snowden | 297\nor phone lines more freely if Snowden had not divulged the NSA’s\nsurveillance of them, but there can be little doubt that his breach\nof the secrecy envelope had serious consequences for U.S., French,\nand British intelligence. For example, François Molins, the former\nhead prosecutor of Paris, pointed out that after the Paris attacks the\nFrench investigation had run into an obstacle: end- to- end encryption.\n“We can’t penetrate into certain conversations,” he said about\n“Telegram,” the end- to- end encryption program that Snowden had\nrepeatedly recommended, and as a result “we’re dealing with this\ngigantic black hole, a dark zone where there are just so many dangerous\nthings going on.”\nThe effects of Snowden’s intervention were soon realized by the\nCIA, according to Michael Morell, who had closely followed intelligence\nabout terrorist groups in the Middle East ever since he had\nacted as the CIA’s briefer for the president on the day of the 9/11\nattack. “Terrorist organizations around the world were already starting\nto modify their actions in light of what Snowden disclosed,”\nMorell wrote in 2015. “Within weeks of the [Snowden] leaks, communications\nsources dried up, tactics were changed.” Even more\ndisturbing, suspects on the CIA’s watch list began switching to an\n“encryption platform.” Instead of continuing to rely on the Internet\nto protect their messages, they increased their use of end- to- end\nencryption, which defeated the effectiveness of PRISM’s capturing\nInternet traffic before it was encrypted by Internet companies.\nIndeed, after the Snowden breach, ISIS even provided a tutorial on\nits websites about using end- to- end encryption. So Morell and others\nat the CIA helplessly watched as this previous source of unexpected\nintelligence went dark.\nWhat further heightened Morell’s concern about this sudden loss\nof NSA intelligence from these sources was the discovery by the\nCIA in January 2014 of two documents, one 26 pages and the other\n19 pages, on a captured ISIS computer in Syria. These documents\ndiscussed the advantages of using bubonic plague germs and other\nbiological weapons against Western civilian populations. They even\nprovided a religious justification for using biological warfare against\ncivilian targets in the West. In addition, evidence uncovered from\nthe safe house used by the ISIS terrorists involved in the Paris attack\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 297\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n298 | how america lost its secrets\nsuggested they had been interested in acquiring radioactive isotopes.\nWithout the advance warning that the NSA’s surveillance of the preencrypted\nInternet had provided in the past, could the CIA now contend\nwith such unconventional threats?\nThe NSA also saw its sources disappearing from its surveillance.\nBefore the Snowden breach, the FBI, the CIA, and the DIA, which\nwere the NSA’s partners in the PRISM program, had compiled a\nwatch list of highly active foreign terrorist targets for the NSA’s\nPRISM program. These “targets” included logistics officers, bomb\nbuilders, weapons specialists, and suicide bomber recruiters. Until\nJune 6, 2013, many of these targets had frequently used Internet\nservices, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Xbox Live, to send what they\nbelieved would be hidden messages. After the PRISM story broke\nin The Washington Post on June 6, the NSA “saw one after another\ntarget go dark,” according to a senior NSA executive involved in\nthat surveillance. The NSA has watched about one thousand of\nthese targets take “steps to remove themselves from our visibility.”\nAccording to the NSA’s deputy director, Richard Ledgett, in 2016,\nthe vanishings included a group planning attacks in Europe and the\nUnited States.\nAdmiral Rogers, the new NSA director, was asked about the damage\ndone by Snowden. He was blunt and direct. Asked in February\n2015 whether or not the disclosures by Snowden had reduced the\nNSA’s ability to pursue terrorists, he answered, “Have I lost capability\nthat we had prior to the revelations? Yes.”\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 298\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nEpilogue\nThe Snowden Effect\nGovernments can reduce our dignity to something like that of\ntagged animals.\n— edward snowden, Moscow, 2016\nThe enormous effect that Snowden has had on America can\nbe divided into three categories: the good, the bad, and the ugly.\nThe good proceeds from the national conversation on the issue of\nsurveillance in 2013 that his disclosures ignited. There is no denying\nthat Snowden’s dramatic disclosures, despite the damage they did to\nU.S. intelligence, accomplished a salutary service in alerting both the\npublic and the government to the potential danger of a surveillance\nleviathan. The steady expansion of the NSA’s collection of telephone\nbilling records under the cloak of secrecy, for example, revealed a\nbureaucratic mission creep that badly needed to be brought under\ncloser oversight by Congress. Snowden’s breach provided another\nbenefit. It pointed to the security dangers proceeding from the NSA’s\nheadlong rush to outsource its computer servicing to private contractors.\nOpening this back door, as Snowden amply demonstrated,\ngreatly increased the risk that America’s secrets would fall into the\nhands of its enemies. An intelligence service has little if any value if\nit cannot keep secret its sources from its adversaries.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 299\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n300 | how america lost its secrets\nThe conversation that Snowden began is necessary for another\nreason. The relentless growth of data- collection technology had\ncome to endanger personal privacy. Smart phones in our pockets,\nGPS recorders in our cars, fitness bands on our wrists, CCTV monitors\nin stores, and network- connected devices in our homes leave a\ndigital trail of every move we make. The government can subpoena\nas part of an investigation, as we know, our personal data, including\nour Internet searches, social media postings, electronic communications,\nand credit card records. In addition, the government has its\nown tools of surveillance. Snowden, by disclosing that the government\nwas vacuuming in phone billing records and Internet activities,\nhit a sore spot in the public’s consciousness. How far did the\nsurveillance state extend? Did an Orwellian government intercept\nprivate conversations of American citizens? Should Apple, Google,\nand other Internet giants use a doomsday system of encryption to\nprevent court- ordered searches for data? Were there adequate safeguards\nagainst government snooping?\nIn popular culture, surveillance is often associated with the sinister\nmeasures taken by a totalitarian government to suppress individual\ndissidence. On television we see government agents in black\nvans operating arrays of tape recorders, following people on the\nstreet, and breaking into homes to steal files and tap telephone lines.\nIn the 2006 Academy Award– winning film The Lives of Others, for\nexample, East Germany’s Stasi police use listening devices to gather\ninformation to blackmail intellectuals to assist in the eradication of\ndissent. East Germany was not the only place in the Cold War era\nusing surveillance to suppress dissent. Even in the United States\nin the 1950s and 1960s, J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI bugged the phones\nof civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr., to root out\nsuspected subversive elements. Most Americans viewed this as a\nreprehensible use of government surveillance, and the very mention\nof the word, even before Snowden’s disclosure, evoked disquiet\namong the public. But what Snowden exposed was not any sort of\nrogue operation but programs authorized by the president and Congress\nand approved by fifteen federal judges. If one accepts that the\nnation’s security remains a legitimate function of government, the\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 300\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nEpilogue | 301\nissue is not surveillance itself; it is the proper way such surveillance\nis conducted.\nThe NSA surveillance of telephone records that Snowden exposed\nwas different in its intent from the surveillance of the Cold War. Its\ntarget was a selected list of 300 to 400 foreign jihadists living abroad.\nMany of these individuals residing in Syria, Iraq, and Pakistan had\nbeen identified by the FBI and the CIA as active bomb makers, assassins,\nand weapon specialists. This was not domestic surveillance, but\nwhen any of these suspects telephoned a phone number in the United\nStates, the NSA checked the billing records of the domestic phone\nnumber that had been called to determine all the calls emanating\nfrom it. The purpose of this search was to assemble for the FBI a list\nof contacts that a foreign suspect might have in the United States. To\nexpedite this task, it obtained from telephone companies the billing\nrecords, without any names attached, of all their users and stored\nthem in a single archive under its control. While this surveillance\ntargeted foreign terrorists, not domestic dissent, the bulk collection\nof phone records had the potential for more nefarious use, a danger\nthat Snowden brought to the public’s attention. As a result, Congress\nmodified the Patriot Act so that billing records would remain\non the computers of the phone companies for a limited time rather\nthan on those of the NSA. The NSA could still search them after\nobtaining an order from the FISA court, though it could not archive\nthe data for future use, so little harm to individual privacy could be\ndone. Snowden deserves a large share of the credit not only for this\nchange but for making the public aware of domestic surveillance.\nThe bad part of the equation is that Snowden deeply damaged an\nintelligence system that American presidents have relied on for over\nsix decades. The heart of that system was the sources and methods\nused to intercept other nations’ communications. Until Snowden, the\nNSA’s wall of secrecy kept these nations from knowing about them\nor, in some cases, even realizing that they were vulnerable to interception.\nFor example, as previously discussed, the NSA had developed\nthe remarkable ability to tap into an adversary nation’s computers,\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 301\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n302 | how america lost its secrets\neven though they had been isolated from any network. This innovation\nhad provided President Obama and his national security team\nan edge of which our adversaries were unaware from 2008 to 2013.\nHowever, Snowden deliberately nullified this advantage in 2013 by\nrevealing this technology (which was published in The New York\nTimes and other newspapers). The vast number of documents that\nhe compromised contained many other secret sources and methods.\nThe full extent of the damage Snowden did may never be fully\nknown, even though the Department of Defense spent the better\npart of a year, and tens of thousands of investigative man- hours,\ntrying to sort out just the compromised sources and methods pertaining\nto military and cyber- defense operations. In addition to the\ndirect and significant cost to taxpayers represented by this investigation,\none measure of how serious the loss has been was revealed by\nMichael McConnell, the vice- chairman of the company for which\nSnowden had worked at the time of the breach. McConnell stated\npublicly, “Snowden has compromised more capability than any spy\nin U.S. history.” McConnell had no obvious reason to exaggerate the\nloss because his company, Booz Allen Hamilton, was partly responsible\nfor the damage. It hired Snowden, as will be recalled, even after\nits vetters had detected an untruthful statement in his application.\nMcConnell said, “This will have impact on our ability to do our\nmission for the next twenty to thirty years.” By any measure, two\ndecades of lost intelligence is a steep price to pay.\nTo be sure, the practical value of peacetime intelligence about\nthe activities of adversary states is not always evident. What is far\nclearer to the public is the value of intelligence that can thwart terrorist\nattacks against subways, theaters, and other civilian targets.\nWe have seen that Snowden also deprived the NSA of much of the\neffectiveness of its PRISM program by revealing it, through the articles\npublished at his specific behest in The Guardian and The Washington\nPost that explained how it worked. This single revelation\ncompromised a system, duly authorized by Congress and the president,\nthat had been the government’s single most effective tool for\nlearning in advance about attacks in America and Europe by jihadist\nterrorists.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 302\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nEpilogue | 303\nThe ugly part of the equation is the rampant growth of the public’s\ndistrust of the institutions of government in America. According\nto recent polls, 4 out of 5 Americans distrust the government.\nSnowden did not create this new age of distrust, but his disclosures\ngreatly contributed to it, as well as to the worldwide distrust of the\nU.S. government. This post- Snowden distrust is especially powerful\nin the section of the international media that assisted Snowden in\nhis release of NSA documents. In defending Snowden, it questions\nthe truthfulness of any government official or member of Congress\nwho discloses information contradicting Snowden’s claims or showing\nthat there was some benefit to the multibillion- dollar intelligence\nsystem that he compromised. Even Senator Dianne Feinstein,\nwho herself fought the secrecy of the CIA for years, was not exempt\nfrom such distrust when she asserted in June 2013 that the program\nthat Snowden had compromised had helped avert a bloody carnage\non the New York subways in September 2009, as mentioned earlier.\nThat she was the ranking Democrat on the Senate Select Committee\non Intelligence, and briefed on the program at the time of the attack,\ndid not prevent a distrustful press from attempting to impeach her\ncredibility and that of the fourteen other members of the Senate\nSelect Committee and the twenty members of the House Select\nCommittee on Intelligence who had affirmed her assertion.\nIn this culture of distrust, any claim that any of the secrets that\nSnowden disclosed could have caused any harm is preemptively dismissed\nas government propaganda. Snowden’s word also is taken\nover that of government officials because, as The Nation explained,\nSnowden speaks “truth to power.” Such a formulation of distrust\nallows those who accept it to dismiss all assertions of government\nofficials representing power who contradict Snowden’s version of\nreality. Such is Snowden’s glorified aura that even when his revelations\nexpose purported U.S. government actions in foreign lands,\nincluding the alleged tapping of friendly government officials’ conversations,\nsuch as Angela Merkel’s, these are implicitly conflated\nwith the NSA’s domestic surveillance program, around which a\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 303\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\n304 | how america lost its secrets\npopular movement has emerged questioning its purpose and methods.\nAs a result, a legitimate debate on what should constitute our\ndomestic liberties— and potential limits to those when facing significant\nsecurity concerns— has largely obfuscated in this mind- set\nthe reality of Snowden’s weakening, durably and structurally, the\ncritical ability of the United States and its allies to address their\nmounting external security challenges. In this culture of distrust,\nwhatever contradicts the innocent whistle- blower narrative can be\npreemptively dismissed because Snowden, even though he remains\nensconced in Moscow at an unknown location, remains the ultimate\ntruth teller.\nI do not accept either this formulation of Snowden or his version\nof the events in which he was the hero. Opening a Pandora’s box of\ngovernment secrets is a dangerous undertaking. Whether Snowden’s\ntheft of state secrets proceeded from an idealistic attempt to right a\nwrong, a narcissistic drive to obtain personal recognition, an intent to\nweaken the foundations of the surveillance infrastructure in which\nhe worked, or a combination of such factors, by the time he arrived\nin Moscow, it had evolved, deliberately or not, but necessarily, into\na mission of disclosing key national secrets to a foreign power. In\nthe end, such conjectures about Snowden’s motives matter less than\nthat he was helped, consciously or not, by others with interests that\ndiffered from those of the United States. The effects on America of\nsuch a massive breach of confidence might not easily be reversible.\nEpst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 304\n9/30/16 8:13 AM\nAcknowledgments\nI am deeply grateful to the many individuals who put their knowledge\nand expertise at my disposal during the course of writing this\nbook.
