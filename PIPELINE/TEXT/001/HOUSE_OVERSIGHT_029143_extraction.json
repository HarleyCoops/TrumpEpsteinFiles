So we need two replacements (for Multiverse as Science \nand Rare Sentience). \nInitial ideas: \n* Expand the first episode \"Mathematics and Truth\" into two or likely three episodes. I'm intrigued by this \nbecause there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner's \n'unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)', astrophysics, cosmology, biology, \ngeneral systems theory. I've felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think \nthree episodes could work - if you agree, I'll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 \nparts. Also, Closer To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 \nepisodes!), so this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the \nseries. \n* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un \nof Wisconsin-Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory. \n* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my \nexpertise, but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you \nneed to tell me if you would like to include this. \n* Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability \nin biomedical and especially psychological research - the scandal in recent years. See links \nand attachments. \nhttps ://en.wikipedia. org/wiki/Replication crisis  \nhttps ://www.nature com/news/over-half- o f-p sycho lo gy-studies-fail-repro ducib ility-test-1 .18248  \nhttp ://science.sciencemag. org/content/349/6251/aac4716  \n\"Replicability vs. Reproducibility\" - http://www.replicability.tau.ac.il/index.php/replicability-in-\nscience/replicability-vs-reproducibility.html  \nFive Ways to Fix Statistics - Nature [attached]. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029145 \n* Other possibile areas you suggest \nWe would like to set a mutually agreed schedule so we can confirm and reserve the Closer To Truth \n'season' of 13 episodes for 'Radical Breakthroughs', which we need to plan well in advance - especially as \nwe begin 2018. \nSee you Jan. 5 - Looking forward to brainstorming. \nRobert \nOn Dec 28, 2017, at 7:40 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \ngreat work , but needs some editing, did not like multi verse and sensience. seems more blahblah \nOn Mon, Dec 11, 2017 at 12:50 AM, Robert Lawrence Kuhn < > wrote: \nHi: When are you back in NY? \nAttached is the complete Preproduction Book for Radical Breakthroughs - now including Misha Gromov! \nLove your feedback, suggestions. \nAlso attached is the budget and timing of funding, as presented originally, now updated for the completion \nof preproduction (phase I).
