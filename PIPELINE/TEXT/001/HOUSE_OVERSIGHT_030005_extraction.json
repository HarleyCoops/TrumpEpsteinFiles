    "full_text": "From: jeffrey E. [jeevacation@gmail.com] \nSent: 2/28/2018 4:52:58 PM \nTo: Steve Bannon \nRibis's Italian immigrant parents taught him to be tightfisted, but it was the Donald who introduced him to \ndealmaking. As a kid in the New Jersey suburbs, Ribis rose before dawn to count the empty soda bottles at the \nfamily deli \"so the suppliers couldn't cheat my mom on the deposits.\" When Trump faced bankruptcy in 1989, \nhe turned to the team of Ribis and Steve Bollenbach, now CEO of Hilton Hotels, to fend off the banks and \nbondholders. Ribis helped persuade creditors to let Trump keep his trophy holding: his casinos. It was the \ngaming company's IPO in 1995, orchestrated by Ribis, that restored Trump's wealth. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
