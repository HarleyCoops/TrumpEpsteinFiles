The young, bright options trader, who \nunderstood Black Sholes and how to use it, at Bear, made good!! \nUnless your PR advisor is Donald Trump, I am not sure that current press provides you with much benefit. \nPerhaps I am wrong? Not the first time!! \nAnyway, middle age has brought its own unique set of challenges. Aging certainly ain't for sissy's. \nRegards, \nJamie Rosenwald \nPs. David Asch and I toasted to you during our Thanksgiving weekend in Amagansett in November. \nChristina Galbraith \nMEDIA/PR \nJeffrey Epstein VI Foundation \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031591 \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
