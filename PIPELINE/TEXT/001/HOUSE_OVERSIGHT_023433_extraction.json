There may be \nsomeone as good in New York, but i'll never tell you and you really have a heck of a seminar table there. \nWhen do we do Whitman's \"Song of Myself\" 1-15 Who else is reading with us? I'm ready. \nA few other follow ups: \nDavid and Brigid point out that reality tv doesn't cost anything because it is, as it sounds, very low budget. \nNo writing , no special expertise or knowledge or research , no archival footage , no copyright clearance, \nno actors, no travel beyond the one location, certainly no clinton or woody allen or justice elena kagan or \ndavid brooks or Lena Dunham or even Professor New. That said, I think If were hiring the crew id do it \nfor less -- probably 1, 250,000 all in . But I haven't won 10 Emmys and David has . That has value too. As \ndoes Wgbh .
