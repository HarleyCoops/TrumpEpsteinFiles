(Universal \nsearch, no history applied). Results will be very different if that PC has been used to click or search any of the \nresults and has not been cleared. \nHow did you pull the results you just sent? \nUsing Google Chrome + InCognito Mode + Clearing Browser Cache = only reliable reporting. I can help set \nyou up with this. Screenshot here of results using above method - http://i.imgur.com/tfGN3Zi.png. This is the \ntrue representation of what your average searcher will find (statistically, most searches will be from users whom \nhave not clicked on your negative articles before) \nMuch progress has been made since we spoke - premium placements are getting secured over next week, \nhundreds of links have been built to your primary sites and the first movements are kicking in today (NYMag \nmoved up to 4th a few hours ago). We still have confidence we are on the right track and doing everything we \ncan to get this cleaned up - another 45 days should be enough to have a clean first page based on what has been \ndone. \nPS - The foundation site was just hacked and I'm in the process of fixing that today. You can actually see it in \nthe screenshot above (it reads Cash Advance advertisement in the short-description). This is something a \nprevious company deployed but we are now going through and securing the rest of the domains to prevent basic \nhijacks like this. \nI'm free on my cell for next few hours. \nSincerely, \nTyler Shears \nOn Fri, Jan 24, 2014 at 3:04 PM, Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nAbout 40,700,000 results (0.21 seconds) \nSearch Results \n1.
