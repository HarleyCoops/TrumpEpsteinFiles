He's been one of Trump's closest advisers through the 2016 campaign and into the \nadministration. Barrack also is a leading fundraiser for the president and oversaw the fundraising for the inauguration. \nBarrack has a longstanding relationship with Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort's onetime \ndeputy, Rick Gates. \nGates agreed to begin cooperating with Mueller's investigators in February. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030444 \n"
