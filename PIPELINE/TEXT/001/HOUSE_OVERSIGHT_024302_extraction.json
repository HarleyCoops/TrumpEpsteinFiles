The Garcia\nParties are currently entitled to ten votes per share of Class B common stock they beneficially own. All other holders of Class B common stock are entitled\nto one vote per share.

FOR an advisory vote that future advisory votes on executive compensation occur annually.\nQ: How do I cast my vote?\nBeneficialStockholders.

Beneficial stockholders should contact their broker, trustee, or nominee for instructions on how to change their proxy\nRegisteredStockholders. Registered stockholders may change a properly executed proxy at any time before its exercise by\n1. delivering written notice of revocation to the general counsel and secretary at our principal executive offices at 1930 W. Rio Salado Pkwy,\nTempe, AZ 85281;\n2. submitting another proxy that is dated later than the original proxy (including a proxy via telephone or internet); or\n3. voting in person at the annual meeting.\nQ: Who can attend the annual meeting?\nSubject to space availability, all common stockholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the annual meeting.\nSince seating is limited, admission to the annual meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration will begin at 7:30 AM (PDT). If you attend,\nplease note that you may be asked to present valid photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport.\nPlease also note that if you are a beneficial stockholder (that is, you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee), you will need to\nbring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date and check in at the registration desk at the annual meeting.\nCameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the annual meeting.\nQ: What is the voting requirement to approve each of the items, and how are the votes counted?\nITEM1–ELECTIONOFDIRECTORS. A plurality of the votes cast by the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy\nat the meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to elect each nominee. This means that the two nominees receiving the highest number of votes at the\nannual meeting will be elected, even if those votes do not constitute a majority of the votes cast. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not impact the\nelection of the nominees.\nALLOTHERITEMS. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shares of common stock present in person or represented by\nproxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve all other items. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote on the\nproposal and will therefore have the effect of a negative vote. We do not expect there to be any broker non-votes with respect to any of the proposals.\n- 3 -\nTable of Contents\nQ: When will the results of the vote be announced?\nThe preliminary voting results will be announced at the annual meeting. The final voting results will be published in a current report on Form\n8-K filed with the SEC within four business days of the annual meeting.\nQ: What is the deadline for submitting a stockholder proposal or director nomination for the 2020 Annual Meeting?\nStockholder proposals pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8 for inclusion in Carvana’s proxy statement and form of proxy for Carvana’s 2020 Annual\nMeeting of Stockholders must be received by Carvana at our principal executive offices at 1930 W. Rio Salado Pkwy, Tempe, AZ, 85281, no later than the\nclose of business on November 15, 2019.

If so, Carvana will release\nan updated time frame for stockholder proposals. Any stockholder proposal or director nomination must comply with the other provisions of Carvana’s\namended and restated bylaws and be submitted in writing to the general counsel and secretary at Carvana’s principal executive offices.\n- 4 -\nTable of Contents\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nOur business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board, which is composed of five directors. Our certificate of incorporation\nprovides that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our Board. Our certificate also provides that our Board will be\ndivided into three classes of directors, with the classes as nearly equal in number as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, a class of directors\nwill be elected for a three-year term to succeed the class whose term is then expiring.\ndirectors:\nThe following table sets forth the director class, name, age as of April 23, 2019, and other information for each member of our board of\nCURRENT\nTERM\nEXPIRES\nEXPIRATION\nOF TERM\nFOR WHICH\nNOMINATED\nNAME CLASS AGE POSITION\nDIRECTOR\nSINCE\nGregory Sullivan II 60 Director 2017 2019 2022\nDan Quayle II 72 Director 2017 2019 2022\nMichael Maroone III 65 Lead Director 2017 2020\nErnest Garcia III I 36 President, CEO and Chairman 2017 2021\nIra Platt I 55 Director 2017 2021\nWe believe that in order for our Board to effectively guide us to long-term sustainable, dependable performance, it should be composed of\nindividuals with sophistication and experience in the many disciplines that impact our business. To best serve our stockholders, we seek to have a board\nthat, as a whole, is competent in key corporate disciplines, including accounting and financial acumen, business judgment, crisis management, governance,\nleadership, people management, risk management, social responsibility and reputational issues, and strategy and strategic planning. Additionally, the Board\ndesires to have specific knowledge related to our industry, such as expertise in automotive retail and consumer finance.\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that all directors must, at a minimum, meet the criteria set forth in the Board’s code of\nconduct and the corporate governance guidelines, which specify, among other things, that the Compensation and Nominating Committee will consider\ncriteria such as independence, diversity, age, skills, and experience in the context of the needs of the Board. In addressing issues of diversity in particular,\nthe Compensation and Nominating Committee considers a nominee’s differences in viewpoint, professional experience, background, education, skill, age,\nrace, gender, and national origin. The Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that diversity of backgrounds and viewpoints is a key attribute for\na director nominee. Accordingly, to improve director diversity and best serve our stockholders, the Compensation and Nominating Committee adopted a\npolicy in 2019 to request that any search firm that it engages include women and minority candidates in the initial list from which the committee selects\ndirector candidates. The Compensation and Nominating Committee also will consider a combination of factors for each director, including whether the\nnominee possesses:\n- 5 -\nTable of Contents\n• the ability to represent all stockholders without a conflict of interest;\n• the ability to work in and promote a productive environment;\n• sufficient time and willingness to fulfill the substantial duties and responsibilities of a director;\n• the high level of character and integrity that we expect;\n• broad professional and leadership experience and skills necessary to effectively respond to the complex issues encountered by a national,\npublicly traded company; and\n• the ability to apply sound and independent business judgment.\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee has determined that all of our directors meet the criteria and qualifications set forth in the code\nof conduct for the Board of Directors, the corporate governance guidelines and the criteria set forth above for director nominees. Moreover, each director\npossesses the following critical personal qualities and attributes that we believe are essential for the proper functioning of the Board to allow it to fulfill its\nduties for our stockholders: accountability, ethical leadership, governance, integrity, risk management, and sound business judgment. In addition, our\ndirectors have the mature confidence to assess and challenge the way things are done and recommend alternative solutions, a keen awareness of our\nbusiness and the social realities of the environment in which we operate, the independence and high-performance standards necessary to fulfill the Board’s\noversight function, and the humility, professional maturity, and style to interface openly and constructively with other directors. Finally, the director\nbiographies below include a non-exclusive list of other key experiences and qualifications that further qualify the individual to serve on the Board. These\ncollective qualities, skills, experiences, and attributes are essential to our Board’s ability to exercise its oversight function for Carvana and its stockholders\nand to guide the long-term sustainable, dependable performance of our business.\nSubject to any earlier resignation or removal in accordance with the terms of our certificate and bylaws, our Class II directors will serve until\nthis our second annual meeting of stockholders, our Class III directors will serve until the third annual meeting of stockholders, and our Class I directors\nwill serve until our fourth annual meeting of stockholders. In addition, our certificate provides that our directors may be removed with or without cause by\nthe affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of our outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, for\nso long as the Garcia Parties are entitled to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock they hold. If the Garcia Parties are no longer entitled to ten\nvotes for each share of Class B common stock they hold, then our directors may be removed only for cause upon the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 ⁄ 3 % of\nthe voting power of our outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon.\n- 6 -\nTable of Contents\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee will consider stockholder nominations for membership on the Board. For the 2020 Annual\nMeeting, nominations may be submitted to Carvana Co., 1930 W. Rio Salado Pkwy, Tempe, AZ 85281, Attn: Secretary, who will forward them to the\nChairman of the Compensation and Nominating Committee. Recommendations must be in writing and we must receive the recommendation no later than\nthe close of business on January 24, 2020, and not earlier than the close of business on December 25, 2019. Recommendations must also include certain\nother requirements specified in our bylaws. The committee will apply the same criteria to the evaluation of those candidates as it applies to other director\ncandidates.\nWhen filling a vacancy on the Board, the Compensation and Nominating Committee identifies the desired skills and experience of a new\ndirector and nominates individuals who it believes can strengthen the Board’s capabilities and further diversify the collective experience represented by the\nthen-current directors. The Compensation and Nominating Committee may engage third parties to assist in the search and provide recommendations.\nPursuant to a previously informal policy formally adopted in 2019, any search firm that the committee engages is requested to include women and minority\ncandidates in the initial list from which the committee selects director candidates. Also, directors are generally asked to recommend candidates for the\nposition. The candidates would be evaluated based on the process outlined in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Compensation and Nominating\nCommittee charter, and the same process would be used for all candidates, including candidates recommended by stockholders.\n- 7 -\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nOur Board recommends that the nominees below be elected as members of the Board at the annual meeting to serve for a three-year term\nexpiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting.\nNAME AGE\nDIRECTOR\nSINCE POSITION\nGregory Sullivan 60 2017 Director\nDan Quayle 72 2017 Director\nEach nominee was recommended for re-election by the Compensation and Nominating Committee for consideration by the Board and proposal\nto our stockholders. If, before the annual meeting, any nominee becomes unable to serve, or chooses not to serve, the Board may (i) nominate a substitute\n(ii) allow the vacancy to remain until the Board identifies an appropriate candidate or (iii) reduce the size of the board to eliminate the vacancy. If the Board\nchooses to nominate a substitute nominee, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card will vote for that substitute nominee.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote “FOR” each of the director nominees.\nDIRECTOR NOMINEES\nDan Quayle has served on our Board since the completion of our initial public offering (“IPO”) in 2017.

He has served as chairman of Cerberus Global Investments\nsince 2001. Mr. Quayle earned a B.A. degree in political science from DePauw University and a J.D. from the Indiana University Robert H.

Mr. Sullivan is the co-founder and chief executive officer of\nAFAR Media, a travel media company he co-founded in 2007.

Mr. Sullivan earned a B.B.A. degree in finance from the University of Notre Dame and a J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law.

Mr. Garcia is\nalso Chairman of the Carvana Co. Board. Prior to founding Carvana, Mr. Garcia held various roles at DriveTime from January 2007 to January 2013.

Mr. Garcia holds a B.S. in management science and\nengineering from Stanford University. We believe that Mr. Garcia is qualified to continue to serve on our Board because of his extensive knowledge of our\nbusiness and strategy, as well as his experience in the automotive retail industry and leadership role with us.\nIra Platt has served on our Board since the completion of our IPO in 2017. Mr. Platt has been the president of Georgiana Ventures, LLC, a\nfirm that provides equity and debt capital to specialty finance companies, acquires portfolios of consumer finance receivables and offers consulting services\nto the specialty finance industry, since its inception in 2009.

We believe that Mr. Platt will continue to be a valuable member of our Board because of his service on\nDriveTime’s board and his extensive experience in consumer finance and the automotive retail industry.\nMichael Maroone has served on our Board since the completion of our IPO. Mr. Maroone is currently the CEO of Maroone U.S.A. LLC. From\nJuly 2005 to April 2015, Mr. Maroone served on the board of AutoNation, Inc., an automotive retailer and provider of new and used vehicles and related\nservices.

He holds a B.S.\ndegree in small business management from the University of Colorado Boulder. Mr. Maroone was selected to serve on our Board because of his advisory\nexperience and his extensive experience in the automotive retail industry\nINDEPENDENCE STATUS\nThe listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company’s audit\ncommittee, and compensation committee, and nominating committee be independent and that audit committee members also satisfy independence criteria\nset forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.\nOur Board has determined that each of our non-employee directors, including our director nominees Dan Quayle and Gregory Sullivan, meets\nthe requirements to be an independent director. In making this determination, our Board considered the relationships that each non-employee director has\nwith Carvana and all other facts and circumstances that our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence, including beneficial ownership of\nour Class A common stock.\nCONTROLLED COMPANY STATUS\nFor purposes of the corporate governance rules of the NYSE, we are a “controlled company.” Controlled companies under those rules are\ncompanies of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company. The Garcia\nParties beneficially own more than 50% of the combined voting power of Carvana Co. Accordingly, we expect to be eligible for, but do not currently intend\nto take advantage of, certain exemptions from the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. Specifically, as a “controlled company,” we would not\nbe required to have:\n• a majority of independent directors,\n• a nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the\ncommittee’s purpose and responsibilities,\n• a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and\nresponsibilities, or\n• an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees.\n- 10 -\nTable of Contents\nIn the event we choose to rely on some or all of these exemptions in the future, you would not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of\ncompanies that are subject to all of the applicable corporate governance rules of the NYSE.\nBOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our Board held five meetings, our Audit Committee held nine meetings, and our Compensation and\nNominating Committee held four meetings. Directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of stockholders and all or substantially all of the Board\nmeetings and meetings of committees on which they serve, and to spend the time needed and meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their\nresponsibilities. Each director attended last year’s annual meeting, 100% of the meetings of the Board during such director’s tenure, and 100% of the\nmeetings held by the committees of the Board on which the director served.\nOur Board has an Audit Committee and a Compensation and Nominating Committee. The composition, duties and responsibilities of these\ncommittees are as set forth below. In the future, our board may establish other committees, as it deems appropriate, to assist it with its responsibilities.\nCOMPENSATION\nAND\nBOARD MEMBER\nAUDIT\nCOMMITTEE\nNOMINATING\nCOMMITTEE\nIra Platt • •\nGregory Sullivan • •\nDan Quayle •\nMichael Maroone •\nAUDITCOMMITTEE\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for, among other matters,\n• appointing, compensating, retaining, evaluating, terminating, and overseeing our independent registered public accounting firm;\n• discussing with our independent registered public accounting firm their independence from management;\n• reviewing with our independent registered public accounting firm the scope and results of their audit;\n• approving all audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm;\n• overseeing the financial reporting process and discussing with management and our independent registered public accounting firm the interim\nand annual financial statements that we file with the SEC;\n- 11 -\nTable of Contents\n• reviewing and monitoring our accounting principles, accounting policies, financial and accounting controls, and compliance with legal and\nregulatory requirements;\n• establishing procedures for the confidential anonymous submission of concerns regarding questionable accounting, internal controls, or auditing\nmatters;\n• reviewing and approving related party transactions; and\n• overseeing our enterprise risk management program.\nOur Board has affirmatively determined that Mr. Platt, Mr. Maroone, and Mr. Sullivan meet the definition of “independent director” for\npurposes of serving on an Audit Committee under Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and the NYSE rules. In addition, our Board has determined that\nMr. Platt qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert,” as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. The written charter for our Audit\nCommittee is available at our corporate website at investors.carvana.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents.\nCOMPENSATIONANDNOMINATINGCOMMITTEE\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee is responsible for, among other matters,\n• reviewing key employee compensation goals, policies, plans, and programs;\n• reviewing and providing recommendations to the Board regarding the compensation of our directors, chief executive officer, and other\nexecutive officers;\n• reviewing and approving employment agreements and other similar arrangements between us and our executive officers;\n• administering stock plans and other incentive compensation plans;\n• identifying individuals qualified to become members of our Board, consistent with criteria approved by our Board;\n• overseeing the organization of our Board to discharge the Board’s duties and responsibilities properly and efficiently;\n• identifying best practices and recommending corporate governance principles; and\n• developing and recommending to our Board a set of corporate governance guidelines and principles applicable to us.\nThe Board has adopted a written charter for the Compensation and Nominating Committee, which is available on our corporate website at\ninvestors.carvana.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents. Each member of our Compensation and Nominating Committee is an independent\ndirector as defined by NYSE rules.\n- 12 -\nTable of Contents\nBOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE\nThe following section describes our board leadership structure, the reasons why the structure is in place at this time, the roles of various\npositions, and related key governance practices. The mix of experienced independent and management directors that make up our Board, along with the\nindependent role of our lead director and our independent board-committee composition, benefits Carvana and its stockholders.\nINDEPENDENCE;BOARDMIX\nOur Board has an effective mix of independent and management directors. It is composed of four independent directors and our current\nchairman and chief executive officer, Ernest Garcia III.\nLEADDIRECTOR\nThe Board believes that it is beneficial to Carvana and its stockholders to designate one of the directors as a lead director who is elected by a\nmajority of the Board. The lead director serves a variety of roles, including reviewing and approving Board schedules to confirm the appropriate board and\ncommittee topics are reviewed and sufficient time is allocated to each; liaising between our chairman and chief executive officer and non-management\ndirectors when necessary and appropriate (that said, each director has direct and regular access to the chairman and chief executive officer) and calling an\nexecutive session of independent directors at any time consistent with the bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Michael Maroone, an independent\ndirector and member of our Audit Committee, is currently our lead director. Mr. Maroone is an effective lead director for Carvana due to, among other\nthings, his independence, his board leadership experience with AutoNation, Inc., his strong strategic and financial acumen, his commitment to ethics, his\nextensive knowledge of the automotive retail environment, and his deep understanding of Carvana and its business.\nCHAIRMAN/CEO\nWith respect to the roles of chairman and CEO, the corporate governance guidelines provide that the roles may be separated or combined, and\nthe Board will exercise its discretion in combining or separating these positions as it deems appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances. Mr. Garcia has\nbeen our chairman and CEO since our IPO. The Board believes that combining the roles of chairman and CEO, together with the separate, independent role\nof our lead director, is currently the most effective leadership structure because Mr. Garcia has extensive knowledge and experience in a variety of relevant\nareas acquired through his professional and other experiences, including automotive retail, e-commerce, consumer finance and strategic planning. This\nknowledge and experience give Mr. Garcia the insight necessary to combine the responsibilities of strategic development and execution along with\nmanagement of day-to-day operations.\n- 13 -\nTable of Contents\nSELF-EVALUATION\nOur Compensation and Nominating Committee conducts an annual performance evaluation to determine whether the Board, its committees,\nand the directors are functioning effectively. This includes survey materials as well as conversations between each director and the lead director. The\nevaluation focuses on the Board’s and the committees’ contributions to Carvana and has an enhanced focus on areas in which the Board or management\nbelieves that the Board could improve.\nAs part of the annual Board self-evaluation, the Board evaluates whether the current leadership structure continues to be appropriate for\nCarvana and its stockholders. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the flexibility for our Board to modify our leadership structure in the future as\nappropriate.\nSECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE.\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and greater-than-ten-percent stockholders to file initial reports of\nownership and reports of changes in ownership of any of our securities with the SEC and us. We believe that during the 2018 fiscal year, all of our directors,\nexecutive officers and greater-than-ten-percent stockholders complied with the requirements of Section 16(a).\nRISK OVERSIGHT\nThe Board, as a whole and through the Audit Committee, oversees our risk management program, which is designed to identify, evaluate, and\nrespond to our high priority risks and opportunities. The risk management program facilitates constructive dialog at the senior management and board level\nto proactively realize opportunities and manage risks. Our Audit Committee is primarily responsible for overseeing our risk management processes on\nbehalf of the full board. Our management, including our executive officers, is primarily responsible for managing the risks associated with the operation and\nbusiness of our company and provides regular updates to the Audit Committee and annual updates to the full board on the risk management program and\nreports on the identified high priority risks and opportunities.\nCODEOFETHICSANDCONDUCT\nWe have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers, and directors, including those officers\nresponsible for financial reporting. Our code of business conduct and ethics is available on our website at investors.carvana.com/corporategovernance/governance-documents.\nWe intend to disclose any amendments to the code or waivers of its requirements on our website.\n- 14 -\nTable of Contents\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION\nNo interlocking relationships exist between the members of our Board and the board or compensation committee of any other company.\nCOMMUNICATIONS BY STOCKHOLDERS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nStockholders and other interested parties may contact an individual director, the lead director, the Board as a group, or a specified board\ncommittee or group, including the non-management directors as a group, by sending regular mail to\nCarvana Co.\n1930 W.

Carvana generally will not forward to the directors a communication that is primarily commercial in\nnature, relates to an improper or irrelevant topic, or requests general information regarding Carvana.\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nPrior to our IPO, none of our directors received compensation as a director from us. We have designed our non-employee director\ncompensation program to achieve the following objectives:\n• align directors’ interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders;\n• attract and retain outstanding director candidates with diverse backgrounds and experiences; and\n• recognize the substantial time commitment required to serve as a Carvana director.\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee reviews the Company’s director compensation program annually. Independent directors may\nnot receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees from us. Members of the Board who are employees of Carvana do\nnot receive compensation for their service on the Board.

We had another year of triple-digit growth in unit retails sold and revenue, while making significant\nprogress in our gross profit per unit and EBITDA margin. Our growth has few historical precedents and makes us one of the fastest-growing technology,\nconsumer, or retail companies at our scale.\nThe highlights of our 2018 performance include:\n• 113% increase in retail units sold, from 44,252 to 94,108;\n• 128% revenue growth, from $859 million to $1.96 billion;\n- 19 -\nTable of Contents\n• 41 new markets, bringing our total from 44 to 85;\n• 8 additional car vending machines, bringing our total from 7 to 15;\n• a $551 increase in gross profit per unit (incl. gift) from $1,539 to $2,090, and a $594 increase in gross profit per unit ex-Gift, from $1,539 to\n$2,133;\n• an increase in net loss margin (incl. Gift) from (19.1%) to (13.0%);\n• an increase in EBITDA margin ex-Gift, from (16.9%) to (9.9%); and\nNotethatgrossprofitperunitex-giftandEBITDAmarginex-giftarenon-GAAPmeasures.Adescriptionofthesemeasuresandareconciliationofthese\nmeasurestothenearestcomparableGAAPmeasurecanbefoundintheannexofthisproxystatement.\n- 20 -\nTable of Contents\n• a one-year total shareholder return of 71.1%, significantly outperforming our peer group companies (see “Competitiveness of our\nCompensation Program” below) as an index as well as the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Retailing Indices.\nKEYCOMPENSATIONDESIGNANDDECISIONSTOLINKPAYANDPERFORMANCE\nUnderlying our executive compensation program is a strong belief in promoting a pay-for-performance culture. We accomplish this by linking\na significant portion of the compensation of our executive officers, including our named executive officers, to our performance. In addition, the\nCompensation and Nomination Committee seeks to set challenging threshold and target performance levels that reflect our rapid growth trajectory and\nbusiness plans rather than goals based on prior years’ achievements. For each of the metrics used in our performance-based compensation plans, payouts are\nearned based upon outstanding performance as measured against pre-established financial objectives.\nCORPORATEGOVERNANCEHIGHLIGHTSREGARDINGEXECUTIVECOMPENSATION\nWe endeavor to maintain sound executive compensation policies and practices, including compensation-related corporate governance\nstandards, consistent with our executive compensation philosophy. The following summarizes our executive compensation and related governance policies\nand practices:\n- 21 -\nTable of Contents\nWHAT WE DO WHAT WE DO NOT DO\n✓ A significant portion of compensation is “at risk” and tied to long-term\ncompany performance\nû No discretionary or guaranteed incentives payments\nû No new or legacy exercise-tax gross-up provisions\n✓ Annual incentive plan metrics are solely based on company performance;\nawards are determined based on pre-established targets\nû No option repricing without stockholder consent\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nMarket-based executive compensation levels are reviewed by\nCompensation and Nominating Committee annually\nPerformance-measured incentive awards are subject to a compensation\nrecoupment policy\nExecutives are prohibited from hedging\nAn independent compensation consultant is retained to evaluate our\nexecutive compensation and make recommendations\nWe believe that we have designed executive compensation plans that effectively support our strategic and financial goals, create a culture of\nteamwork, and are directly tied to the performance of the company and shareholder outcomes. We will continue to utilize rigorous governance processes to\nmonitor and evaluate the compensation programs as well as implement best practices in compensation governance. We welcome shareholder feedback on\nour programs.\nCOMPENSATION OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES\nCarvana seeks to create and maintain a culture of teamwork and high performance. Our executive compensation programs are one of the tools\nwe utilize to accomplish this objective. Philosophically, we aim to treat our executives fairly when considering:\n• the complexity of their jobs,\n• the market for their executive talent,\n• their individual performance,\n• the financial and strategic performance of the company, and\n• the need to retain the executives.\nWithin that framework, it is critical that we meet our objectives to:\n• attract and retain the best executive talent to support our growth,\n• align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders, and\n• provide incentives that are linked directly to our long- and short-term strategy.\nWe set very challenging goals as our incentive compensation metrics and we expect that our executives will in aggregate be paid approximately\nat the median for achieving those goals through the plans outlined in this CD&A. As evidenced by our track record of growth and strategic progress, our\napproach to executive compensation has been effective.\n- 22 -\nTable of Contents\nCOMPENSATION SETTING PROCESS\nROLEOFCOMPENSATIONANDNOMINATINGCOMMITTEEANDCHIEFEXECUTIVEOFFICERINSETTINGEXECUTIVECOMPENSATION\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee has responsibility for overseeing the design, development, and implementation of the\ncompensation program for our chief executive officer and other NEOs. The committee evaluates the performance of our chief executive officer and the\nperformance of the other executive officers. Our chief executive officer assists the committee in evaluating the performance of our other executive officers,\nincluding the named executive officers other than the chief executive officer. Our chief executive officer does not participate in portions of committee\nmeetings or meetings of the Board when his compensation is discussed and determined, and has requested that his total compensation be set significantly\nbelow the market median due to his significant ownership interest in our company\nBased on these assessments, the members of the Compensation and Nominating Committee, each of whom is an independent director, make the\nfinal compensation decisions for the NEOs other than the CEO, and make recommendations to the Board for the CEO’s compensation. The Board makes\nthe final decision for the CEO’s compensation.\nINDEPENDENTCOMPENSATIONADVISOR\nOur Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that independent advice is important in developing Carvana’s executive compensation\nprograms. Since September 2017, the committee has engaged Korn Ferry as its independent compensation consultant to advise on executive compensation\nmatters. All work performed by the independent compensation consultant regarding our executive compensation program is tasked and overseen directly by\nthe committee. Our management provides information and analyses to the committee at the committee’s direction.\nIn addition to advising on our executive compensation program, Korn Ferry, at the request of and in service to the committee, provided certain\nother compensation advisory services for 2018 compensation, including assistance with establishing a compensation peer group, benchmarking aggregate\nbroad-based equity usage (including run-rate and total dilution), benchmarking director compensation, benchmarking\nnon-executive employee compensation in certain job families within our company, and developing the narrative disclosure in this Compensation Discussion\nand Analysis. Our Compensation and Nominating Committee paid Korn Ferry $103,000 for their 2018 services.\nKorn Ferry does not provide any other material services to Carvana Co. The committee has assessed the independence of Korn Ferry pursuant\nto the NYSE rules and concluded that Korn Ferry’s work for the committee did not raise any conflicts of interest.\n- 23 -\nTable of Contents\nCOMPETITIVENESS OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM\nOur executive compensation program is designed so that the sum of base pay plus total short- and long-term compensation is competitive with\nmarket practices. Market practices—or benchmarks—are based on peer-group data and compensation survey data.\nThe past year, 2018, was our first year of developing a compensation peer group. Many of our direct industry competitors are either privately\nheld companies or are larger than us in revenue size, although very few have our growth trajectory. The Compensation and Nominating Committee, with the\nassistance of its compensation consultant, Korn Ferry, reviewed and selected potential peer companies based on revenue size, industry focus, growth rates,\ncomplexity of operations, customer base, and market for talent. With the assistance of its compensation consultant, the committee approved the following\ncompensation peer group in order to determine market pay levels and pay practices for fiscal year 2018:\n• 1-800-Flowers.com, Inc.\n• America’s Car-Mart, Inc.\n• Cars.com Inc.\n• Etsy, Inc.\n• Grubhub, Inc.\n• MarineMax, Inc.\n• Monro, Inc.\n• Overstock.com, Inc.\n• RH\n• Sleep Number Corporation\n• TrueCar, Inc.\n• U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc.\n• Wayfair Inc.\n• Zillow Group, Inc.\nGoing forward, the Compensation and Nominating Committee expects to review our compensation peer group on an annual basis for continued\nappropriateness, considering changes in both our size and business and the businesses of the companies in the peer group.\nThe committee also uses compensation survey data in its evaluation of executive pay for the NEOs. Survey data provides insight into positions\nthat may not generally be reported in proxy statements and information about the compensation of executives of non-public companies. To assist the\ncommittee in evaluating fiscal year 2018 compensation levels, the committee reviewed both peer-group proxy data and information from survey databases,\nutilizing appropriate subsets based on the size of the company.\nCOMPENSATION COMPONENTS\nIn accordance with our overall compensation philosophy and program, executives are provided with a mix of base salary, short-term incentives,\nlong-term incentives and employee benefits. Our compensation philosophy places a significant portion of the potential total compensation for each NEO “at\nrisk” such that compensation will vary based on performance of Carvana. Variable compensation is a component of compensation for most of our\nemployees, but a higher proportion of our NEOs’ compensation is at risk than that of our general employee population. As shown in the pay mix chart\nbelow, our compensation program is designed to be highly performance-based with approximately 80% of each of our NEO’s compensation tied to our\nfinancial performance and stock price performance.\n- 24 -\nTable of Contents\nThe following table describes the material elements of compensation and the objectives of each element:\nPROGRAM DESCRIPTION OBJECTIVES\nANNUAL COMPENSATION:\nBaseSalary\nAnnualIncentivePlan\nLONG-TERM COMPENSATION:\nLong-TermIncentiveProgram\n• Ongoing cash compensation based on executive\nofficer’s role, responsibilities, competitive market\npositioning, and individual performance.\n• Annual cash incentive with target award amounts for\neach executive officer.\n• Actual cash awards may be higher or lower than\ntarget, based on the company’s financial\nperformance.\n• A long-term incentive program using a combination\nof time-vested and performance-based awards.\n- 25 -\n• Attract and retain qualified key managerial talent.\n• Recognize sustained individual performance.\n• Attract and retain qualified key managerial talent.\n• Encourage and reward achievement of annual\nperformance objectives.\n• Focus executives on long-term company performance\nand long-term financial and strategic success.\n• Retention.\n• Align employee and stockholder interests via\nperformance goals and stock ownership.\nTable of Contents\nBASESALARY\nThe base salaries for the named executive officers are reviewed annually by the Compensation and Nominating Committee. Individual salaries\nare determined based upon a combination of factors, including the scope of responsibilities, individual performance and experience, our company’s\nperformance, an individual’s potential for making contributions to future company performance, and competitive pay practices. The committee considers all\nthese factors in determining base salary increases and does not assign a specific weighting to any individual factor.\nIn February 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee reviewed the base salaries of our executive officers, including our named\nexecutive officers, taking into consideration the factors described above. Following this review, the committee determined to maintain the base salary of our\nCEO at its 2017 level and to increase the base salaries of the other four named executive officers to maintain the competitiveness of this compensation\nelement. All of the NEOs’ 2018 base salaries were approximately at or below the market median as determined by the compensation consultant.\nErnest Garcia III, our chief executive officer, had a base salary of $400,000 for both 2017 and 2018, with no increase. Mark Jenkins, our chief\nfinancial officer, had a 2017 base salary of $350,000 and a 2018 base salary of $375,000, an increase of 7.1%. Benjamin Huston, our chief operating officer,\nhad a 2017 base salary of $350,000 and a 2018 base salary of $375,000, an increase of 7.1%. Ryan Keeton, our chief brand officer, had a 2017 base salary\nof $315,000 and a 2018 base salary of $330,000, an increase of 4.8%. Daniel Gill, our chief product officer, had a 2017 base salary of $315,000 and a 2018\nbase salary of $330,000, an increase of 4.8%.\n2018ANNUALINCENTIVEPLAN\nOur annual incentive plan was designed to align our executive officers’ incentives with our company goals and, therefore, to be aligned with the\ninterests of our shareholders. The Compensation and Nominating Committee approves which executives are eligible to participate (other than the CEO) and\nthe level of potential awards, identifies appropriate performance measures, and determines the financial targets of each measure. The CEO makes\nrecommendations as to these matters, but the Compensation and Nominating Committee makes all decisions with respect to the implementation of the\nannual incentive plan. For the CEO’s annual incentive plan, the Compensation and Nominating Committee makes a recommendation, with the Board\nmaking the final decision. In establishing performance goals, the committee and the Board as a whole review industry and market conditions, alignment of\nthe goals with our strategy, projected general economic conditions, and both our past and forecasted performance levels.\nTargetBonusesandPayoutRanges\nFor the 2018 annual incentive plan, the committee established a target bonus at 66.7% of base salary for each of the NEOs, with a payout range\nof 0%–133% of base salary. Utilizing the same bonus target for all the NEOs promotes a culture of teamwork among the senior executives and encourages\ntheir entrepreneurial spirit. As a result, the CEO’s target 2018 total cash, including both base salary and target annual incentive plan amount, is below the\nmarket 25 th percentile of our compensation peer group.\n- 26 -\nTable of Contents\nThe resulting payout range for Mr. Garcia, our chief executive officer, is $0–$530,667, with a target of $266,667. For both Mr. Jenkins, our\nchief financial officer, and Mr. Huston, our chief operating officer, the payout range is $0–$497,500, with a target of $250,000. For both Mr. Keeton, our\nchief brand officer, and Mr. Gill, our chief product officer, the payout range is $0–$437,800, with a target bonus of $220,000.\nPerformanceMetricsandGoals\nThe performance period for the annual incentive is our fiscal year. The committee selected retail units sold, gross profit per unit ex-Gift, and\nEBITDA margin ex-Gift as the performance metrics for our 2018 annual incentive plan because these are the primary metrics we use in evaluating our own\nperformance when communicating our financial results to our investors.\nThe committee believes that these performance measures help focus the executives on growing retail units sold and revenue, increasing total\ngross profit per unit, and demonstrating operating leverage. The detailed definition of each measure and rationale of selection are provided below:\nPERFORMANCE\nMETRICS USED IN\nTHE 2018 AIP WEIGHT DEFINITION RATIONALE OF SELECTION\nRetailUnitsSold 40% The number of vehicles\nsold to customers in a\ngiven period, net of\nreturns under our\nseven-day return policy.\nGrossProfitper\nUnitex-Gift\n40% The gross profit before\ncompensation expense\nrelated to the 100k\nMilestone Gift (as\nhereinafter defined) is\nincluded in cost of sales,\ndivided by retail units sold\nin that period.\nWe view retail units sold as a key measure of our growth for several reasons.\nFirst, retail units sold is the primary driver of our revenues and, indirectly, gross\nprofit, since retail unit sales enable multiple complementary revenue streams,\nincluding financing, VSCs, GAP waiver coverage, and trade-ins. Second, growth\nin retail units sold increases the base of available customers for referrals and\nrepeat sales. Third, growth in retail units sold is an indicator of our ability to\nsuccessfully scale our logistics, fulfillment, and customer service operations.\nTotal gross profit per unit ex-Gift is driven by sales of used vehicles, each of\nwhich generates additional revenue sources including wholesale sales of vehicles\nwe acquire from customers as trade-ins, gains on the sales of loans originated to\nfinance the vehicle, revenue from GAP waiver coverage, and commissions on\nsales of VSCs. We believe total gross profit per unit ex-Gift is a key measure of\nour growth and long-term profitability.\n- 27 -\nTable of Contents\nEBITDAMarginex-Gift 20% Net loss before interest\nexpense, income tax\nexpense, depreciation and\namortization expense, and\nthe compensation expense\nrelated to the 100k\nMilestone Gift, as a\npercentage of total\nrevenues.\nWe believe that EBITDA Margin ex-Gift is an important measure of the leverage\nin our business and a useful measure to us and to our investors because it focuses\nspecifically on operational performance.\nAt the beginning of 2018, the committee established financial performance goals that were challenging and reflective of Carvana’s fiscal 2018\noperating plan, economic and market conditions, and forecasts at the time the performance goals were established. The target performance goal of each\nmetric is significantly above fiscal 2017’s actual results: over 92,000 retail units sold, a 108% increase over fiscal year 2017’s retail units sold of 44,252;\nover $2,100 for gross profit per unit ex-Gift, a $561 increase over fiscal year 2017’s gross profit per unit ex-Gift of $1,539; and EBITDA margin ex-Gift of\nless than (7.2)%, a 9.7 percentage point improvement over fiscal year 2017’s EBTIDA margin ex-Gift of (16.9)%.\nTotalPayouts\nBased on the committee’s evaluation of our 2018 actual performance against the annual incentive plan goals, 88% of the target annual bonuses\nwere paid out, amounting to 59% of the NEOs’ respective base salaries. The annual incentive bonus received by each of the NEOs is included in the\n“Non-Equity Performance Incentive Plan Compensation” column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement.\nEach of the annual incentive metrics provided a payout range of 0%–199% as a percent of the target. For Retail Units Sold, weighted 40% of\nthe total, the target was over 92,000, and our actual performance was 94,108, resulting in a payout of 118% of the target payout. For gross profit per unit ex-\nGift, weighted 40% of the total, the target was over $2,100 and our actual performance was $2,133, resulting in a payout of 103% of the target. For\nEBITDA Margin ex-Gift, weighted 20% of the total, our target was less than (7.2)% and our actual performance was (9.9)%, resulting in no payout.\nAggregating each of the respective payouts, weighted accordingly, resulted in a total payout of 88% of target. Applying the payout of 88% of target to each\nof our NEOs respective target bonuses, Mr. Garcia achieved a $235,733 payout amount; Messrs. Jenkins and Huston achieved a payout of $221,000 each,\nand Messrs. Keeton and Gill achieved a payout of $194,480 each.\nLONG-TERMINCENTIVEPROGRAM\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that stock-based performance compensation is essential to align the interests of\nCarvana’s management and its shareholders in enhancing the long-term value of our equity and to encourage executives to remain with the company.\nAmong the varied types of equity awards the committee is authorized to use under the equity plan, stock options are the ones that the committee has\ndetermined are preferable for use with NEOs, because their\n- 28 -\nTable of Contents\nvalue is more leveraged to future value appreciation and depends upon a future increase in the value of our common stock. The committee also has\ndetermined that restricted stock unit grants to NEOs should be used for the purposes of retention or recognition of outstanding performance in part because\nrestricted stock units are less volatile than stock options.\n2018AnnualGrant\nFor fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee determined to award an equal blend of time-based stock options and restricted\nstock units to provide a mix composed of awards whose value depends upon a future increase in the value of the common stock (time-based stock options)\nand awards that serve primarily as a retention tool (time-based restricted stock units).\nFor the 2018 annual grant, the committee targeted a grant value equal to the amount of each executive’s base salary. The committee initially\ntargeted the annual grant based on a 10-day average stock price as of April 2, 2018 ($21.61). Based on that price, Mr. Garcia would have received 15,988\noptions and 9,255 RSUs; Messrs. Jenkins and Huston would have received 14,989 options and 8,677 RSUs; and Messrs. Keeton and Gill would have\nreceived 13,190 options and 7,635 RSUs. However, the grants were not awarded until mid-July when the stock price had more than doubled ($44.21). To\ncompensate the executives for the disadvantage of receiving stock options with a much higher exercise price, the Committee determined to grant additional\nRSUs. The grant value of the additional RSUs is equal to one-half of the in-the-money value difference between the options granted based on the March\nstock price and the options granted based on the July stock price, resulting in a total of 13,987 RSUs granted to Mr. Garcia, 13,113 to Messrs. Jenkins and\nHuston each, and 11,540 to Messrs. Keeton and Gill each.\n2018SpecialPerformance-ContingentGrant\nFor fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee and the Board also granted a one-time special performance-contingent RSU\naward for driving exceptional company performance to achieve an important milestone in the development of the business. The RSUs were granted on\nApril 30, 2018, to the NEOs other than the CEO; the CEO received his award on May 1, 2018. Mr. Garcia was granted 14,572 RSUs ($393,298 grant\nvalue), Messrs. Jenkins and Huston 13,662 RSUs ($358,081 grant value), and Messrs. Keeton and Gill 12,022 RSUs ($315,097 grant value). All of these\ngrants will vest 100% on the date of the first periodic report filed where positive quarterly EBITDA is reported. None of the RSUs were vested as of the end\nof 2018.\n2018100kMilestoneGift\nOn September 10, 2018, we announced a commitment by our chief executive officer, Ernest Garcia III (“Mr. Garcia”), to contribute 165 shares\nof Class A common stock to us from his personal shareholdings for every one of our then-existing employees, including the NEOs, upon their satisfying\ncertain employment tenure requirements. In connection with these contributions, we have made corresponding grants of 165 restricted stock units under our\n2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan to each employee who has satisfied the requirements and we intend to make grants to the remaining then-existing employees\nas they satisfy the requirements (the “100k Milestone Gift” or “Gift”). Messrs. Jenkins, Huston, Keeton, and Gill all received the grant in 2018, which had a\ngrant date fair value of $10,562.\n- 29 -\nTable of Contents\nPERQUISITESANDBENEFITS\nCurrently, we do not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program.\nAccordingly, we did not provide perquisites to our executive officers in 2018, including our named executive officers, except that each of the NEOs, along\nwith certain other employees, can use one of the company inventory vehicles (which generally will be replaced every three years); each, along with many of\nour employees, may use a company-provided cellular phone; and each, along with all of our employees, may participate in our 401(k) match benefit which\nis based on salary.\nWe do not expect that any future perquisites or other personal benefits will be a significant aspect of our executive compensation program. All\nfuture practices with respect to perquisites or other personal benefits will be approved and subject to periodic review by the Compensation and Nominating\nCommittee.\nTERMINATION,SEVERANCEANDCHANGEINCONTROLBENEFITS\nWe do not have employment or severance agreements with our executives.\nIn the event of a change in control of Carvana Group, all outstanding unvested Class B Unit awards held by participants in the Carvana Group\nequity incentive plan, whose employment has not previously terminated, will accelerate in full, subject to certain escrow demand rights held by a purchaser\nof control of Carvana Group.\nIf an executive is terminated involuntarily without cause within twenty-four months following a change in control as defined by our 2018\nequity award agreements, all outstanding vested stock options and time-based RSUs of that executive will become fully exercisable or vested. An executive\nwhose employment is terminated because of death or disability will receive one year from the time of termination to exercise any then-vested options\ninstead of the usual 90 days, but not past the expiration date of the options. If a person’s employment is terminated for disability, and that person later dies\nwithin a year, the legal representative of the person’s estate may exercise the options within one year of the date of death, though not past the expiration date\nof the options.\nIf a change in control occurs before the performance-contingent RSUs are vested, outstanding shares will vest in a proportionate number based\non the company’s progress toward positive EBITDA, starting from the EBITDA loss baseline as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding\nthe award (-$41.5 million) to the EBITDA as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the date of the closing of the change in control.\nExcept for these arrangements, none of our named executive officers have entered into any plans, arrangements or agreements with Carvana\nproviding for payments upon termination of employment or change in control of Carvana, other than payments generally available to all salaried employees\nthat do not discriminate in scope, terms, or operation in favor of the executive officers of Carvana.\n- 30 -\nTable of Contents\nCOMPENSATION-RELATED POLICIES\nCOMPENSATIONRECOVERY(“CLAWBACK”)POLICY\nIn 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee approved the adoption of a “clawback” policy, which would provide for the clawback\nor recoupment of any compensation granted, earned, or vested that is tied to performance metrics, in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from\nmaterial noncompliance with certain financial reporting requirements that reveals that such performance (or level of performance) was not achieved.\nPOLICYREGARDINGHEDGINGANDPLEDGINGOFCOMPANYSTOCK\nCarvana’s insider trading policy prohibits all employees from buying or selling Carvana securities while aware of material nonpublic\ninformation and prohibits the disclosure of material nonpublic information to others who then trade in our securities. As part of this policy, certain other\nCarvana-securities-related transactions by directors, officers and other employees are also prohibited or subject to specific notice and pre-approval\nrequirements. The policy is premised on the belief that even in those circumstances where the proposed transaction may not constitute a violation of law or\napplicable regulations, it is nonetheless inappropriate for any director, officer, or other employee to engage in short-term or speculative transactions in our\nsecurities which may be viewed as reducing their incentive to improve our performance or inconsistent with the objectives of our stockholders in general.\nTherefore, it is our policy that directors, officers, and other employees may not engage in any transactions involving our securities which constitute short\nsales, puts, calls, or other similar derivative securities. The policy also prohibits certain other transactions, including hedging or monetization transactions—\ne.g., zero-cost collars, forward sale contracts, and arrangements pledging company securities as collateral for a loan (without adequate assurance of other\navailable assets to satisfy the loan).\nCOMPENSATION AND RISK\nWe believe that our compensation programs create appropriate incentives to drive sustained, long-term increases in shareholder value. These\nprograms have been designed and administered in a manner that discourages undue risk-taking by employees. Relevant features of these programs include:\n• Focus on weighting compensation toward four-year and greater vesting schedules of equity awards;\n- 31 -\nTable of Contents\n• individual executive pay generally targeted at median level against comparable executive roles at an appropriate set of peer\ncompanies, except the chief executive officer, for whom we target significantly below median level due to his significant\nownership interest in us;\n• robust clawback policies permitting the recoupment of past incentive pay from executive officers in the event of certain kinds of\nmisconduct, and forfeiture of incentive awards in the event the executive engages in various types of conduct deemed detrimental\nto Carvana’s interests, including theft or fraud against Carvana and engaging in competition with Carvana;\n• no employment agreements with executive officers;\n• the use of retail units sold, gross profit per unit ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift as performance metrics, which incents\nemployees to increase earnings and manage net assets efficiently;\n• restrictions on trading in Carvana Class A common stock to reduce insider trading compliance risk, as well as prohibitions on\npledging and hedging Carvana capital stock.\nIn light of these features, we conclude that the risks arising from our executive and employee compensation policies and practices are not\nreasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.\nTAX AND ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS\nCarvana considers the tax and accounting aspects of the elements of compensation we offer in determining the most effective method for\ncompensating our executives. This includes, but is not limited to, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.\nSection 162(m) generally limits the tax deduction available to public companies for annual compensation paid to the chief executive officer and certain\nother named executive officers in excess of $1 million.\nAs a result of 2017 tax legislation, compensation paid in a fiscal year in excess of $1 million to, or on behalf of, an individual who is a “covered\nemployee” is not expected to be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, unless such compensation qualifies for transition relief\n(relating to written binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017, which were not subsequently materially modified). Therefore, certain compensation\npaid under our existing equity plans and certain of our long-term equity awards originally designed with the intent that such amounts qualify as\n“performance-based” compensation may not be deductible in the future. Although the committee may consider the effect that Section 162(m) and the\npotential lack of deduction for amounts paid in excess of the deduction limit may have on Carvana, the committee continues to retain flexibility to make\ncompensation decisions, in the exercise of its business judgment, that are based on factors that it determines to be appropriate (as determined by the\ncommittee in its sole discretion) to enable Carvana to continue to attract, retain, reward, and motivate its highly-qualified executives. This flexibility may\ninclude amending or modifying the design elements of our historical compensation programs.\n- 32 -\nTable of Contents\nCOMPENSATION AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE REPORT\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee has reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with\nmanagement.

See “Certain\nRelationships and Related Party Transactions – Relationship with DriveTime – Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement.” The incremental cost to Carvana\nof aircraft used under the aircraft time sharing agreement for a non-business flight is calculated by multiplying the aircraft’s per-mile variable\noperating cost by a flight’s total mileage, which includes the mileage of an empty return flight. Variable operating costs include: (1) landing, parking,\npassenger ground transportation, crew travel, and flight planning services expenses; (2) supplies, catering, and crew traveling expenses; (3) aircraft\nfuel and oil expenses; (4) maintenance, parts, and external labor (inspections and repairs); and (5) any customs, foreign permit, and similar fees. Fixed\ncosts that do not vary based upon usage are not included in the calculation of direct operating cost. On certain occasions, a named executive officer or\na named executive officer’s spouse or other family member may fly on the corporate aircraft as additional passengers.

Mr. Garcia’s 2018 annual total compensation was $2,075,726, as disclosed in the “Summary\nCompensation Table” above. The ratio of our median-compensated employee to Mr. Garcia is 1-to-57.\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nPOLICIES FOR APPROVAL OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nWe have adopted a written policy with respect to the review, approval, and ratification of related party transactions. Under the policy, our Audit\nCommittee is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions. In the course of its review and approval of related party transactions, our\nAudit Committee will consider the relevant facts and circumstances to decide whether to approve such transactions. In particular, our policy requires our\nAudit Committee to consider, among other factors it deems appropriate:\n• the related person’s relationship to us and interest in the transaction,\n• the material facts of the proposed transaction, including the proposed aggregate value of the transaction,\n• the impact on a director’s independence in the event the related person is a director or an immediate family member of the director,\n• the benefits to us of the proposed transaction,\n• if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services, and\n• an assessment of whether the proposed transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to\nemployees generally.\nThe Audit Committee may only approve those transactions that are in or are not inconsistent with our best interests and those of our\nstockholders, as the Audit Committee determines in good faith.\nAMENDED AND R ESTATED OPERATING AGREEMENT\nIn connection with the organizational transactions we effected in connection with our IPO, we amended and restated Carvana Group’s existing\noperating agreement, which we refer to as the “LLC Operating Agreement.” In addition, on March 2, 2018, Carvana Group signed an amendment of its\nLLC Agreement to, among other things, create a class of convertible preferred units. The convertible preferred units were created in connection with the\nDecember 5, 2017, issuance and sale of 100,000 shares of convertible preferred stock of Carvana Co. The amendment was effective December 5, 2017. As\nof December 31, 2018, the 100,000 shares of convertible preferred stock had all been converted into shares of Class A common stock and are no longer\noutstanding.\n- 39 -\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the issuance of our senior notes (see Carvana’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018, page 66–67), Carvana Group\namended its LLC agreement to create a class of non-convertible preferred units, which Carvana Co. purchased with its net proceeds from the issuance of\nthese senior notes.\nThe operations of Carvana Group, and the rights and obligations of the holders of our LLC Units (who we refer to as “LLC Unitholders”), are\nset forth in the LLC Operating Agreement.\nEXCHANGE AGREEMENT\nOn April 27, 2017, we entered into an exchange agreement with Carvana Co. Sub LLC (our wholly owned subsidiary) and the LLC\nUnitholders. Under the exchange agreement, LLC Unitholders (and certain permitted transferees thereof) may exchange at any time their LLC Units for\neither shares of our Class A common stock or for cash, whichever we decide. To the extent LLC Unitholders also hold Class B common stock, they will be\nrequired to deliver to us the same number of shares of Class B common stock as Class A common stock being exchanged for. We will then cancel those\nshares of Class B common stock. As LLC Unitholders exchange their interest in Carvana Group, our indirect interest in Carvana Group will increase\ncorrespondingly.\nWhen an LLC Unitholder makes an exchange, they will receive four shares of Class A common stock for every five Class A Units or, at our\noption, cash equal to the value of a share of Class A common stock multiplied by 0.8 times the number of Class A Units being exchanged. The value of the\nClass A common stock is determined by the average of the volume-weighted average prices for a share of Class A common stock for each of the three\nconsecutive full trading days ending on and including the last full trading day immediately prior to the related date of exchange. Class B Units are subject to\nvesting and a participation threshold, and, as a result, LLC Unitholders exchanging Class B Units will receive a number of shares of Class A common stock\nequal to the Class A common stock value (determined the same way as above) less the applicable participation threshold multiplied by 0.8 times the number\nof Class B Units being exchanged, divided by the same Class A common stock value, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Exchange Agreement.\nREGISTRATION R IGHTS AGREEMENT\nIn connection with the IPO, we entered into a registration rights agreement with certain LLC unitholders. These LLC unitholders are entitled to\nrequest that we register their shares on a long-form or short-form registration statement on one or more occasions in the future, which registrations may be\n“shelf registrations.” All of these LLC unitholders will be entitled to participate in certain of our\n- 40 -\nTable of Contents\nregistered offerings, subject to the restrictions in the registration rights agreement. We will pay expenses in connection with the exercise of these rights. The\nregistration rights described in this paragraph apply to (1) shares of our Class A common stock held by certain LLC unitholders, and (2) any of our capital\nstock (or that of our subsidiaries) issued or issuable with respect to the Class A common stock described in clause (1) with respect to any dividend, stock\nsplit, recapitalization, reorganization, or certain other corporate transactions (“Registrable Securities”). These registration rights are also for the benefit of\nany subsequent holder of Registrable Securities, provided that any particular securities will cease to be Registrable Securities when they have been sold in a\nregistered public offering, sold in compliance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act or repurchased by us or our subsidiaries. In addition, any Registrable\nSecurities held by a person other than an LLC Unitholder and their affiliates will cease to be Registrable Securities if they can be sold without limitation\nunder Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nTAX REC EIVABLE AGREEMENT\nWe have entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with LLC Unitholders that will provide for the payment from time to time by us to such\npersons of 85% of the amount of the benefits, if any, that we realize or, under certain circumstances, are deemed to realize as a result of\n1. the increase in our wholly owned subsidiary’s proportionate share of the existing tax basis of the assets of Carvana Group and an adjustment in\nthe tax basis of the assets of Carvana Group reflected in that proportionate share as a result of any future exchanges of LLC Units held by an\nLLC Unitholder for shares of our Class A common stock or cash, and\n2. certain other tax benefits related to our making payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that we actually realize and, except in connection with a change in control, we will not\nmake any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement until after we have directly or indirectly realized (or have been deemed to have realized) benefits\nin excess of such payments. These payment obligations are obligations of Carvana Co. and not of Carvana Group. No payments were made during the year\nended December 31, 2018.\nINDEMNIFICA TION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS\nWe have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our officers and directors. The indemnification agreements provide the officers\nand directors with contractual rights to indemnification, expense advancement, and reimbursement, to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law.\nAdditionally, we may enter into indemnification agreements with any new directors or officers that may be broader in scope than the specific\nindemnification provisions contained in Delaware law.\n- 41 -\nTable of Contents\nCONTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS\nOn September 10, 2018, we announced a commitment by our chief executive officer, Ernest Garcia III, to contribute shares of Carvana Co.\nClass A common stock from his personal shareholdings to Carvana at no charge, intended to fund equity awards of 165 restricted stock units (or roughly\n$10,000 at the time of the announcement) to each of our then-current employees upon their satisfying certain employment-tenure requirements. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2018, Carvana and Mr. Garcia entered into contribution agreements pursuant to which Mr. Garcia contributed approximately\n0.2 million shares of Carvana Co. Class A common stock to Carvana, at no charge. We subsequently granted approximately 0.2 million restricted stock\nunits. Although we do not expect Mr. Garcia to incur any tax obligations related to these contributions, we have indemnified Mr. Garcia from any such\nobligations that may arise.\nRELATIONSHIP WITH DRIVETIME\nPrior to November 1, 2014, Carvana, LLC was a wholly owned subsidiary of DriveTime. On November 1, 2014, DriveTime distributed the\nunits of Carvana, LLC to the unit holders of DriveTime on a pro rata basis, which we refer to as the “Spinoff.” DriveTime is controlled by our controlling\nstockholder, Ernest Garcia II, who is also the father of our Chief Executive Officer, Ernest Garcia III. Following the Spinoff, the unitholders of DriveTime\ncontributed the Carvana, LLC units to Carvana Group.\nSubsequent to the Spinoff, we entered into several agreements with DriveTime and affiliated companies that were intended to facilitate our\ntransition to a standalone company, which are described below, along with subsequent agreements. We will refer to DriveTime and its subsidiaries and\naffiliates, other than us, as “DriveTime”. There can be no assurances that DriveTime or its affiliated companies will enter into any new agreements or\narrangements with us, or extend or renew existing agreements or arrangements, on the same terms, similar terms, or at all.\nATLANTA,GAHUBLOCATIONLEASEGUARANTEE\nIn May 2013, DriveTime guaranteed our obligations under the lease governing our occupancy of the property on which an Atlanta hub is\nlocated. We do not compensate DriveTime for the guarantee. The initial lease term and rent payments commenced December 1, 2013, and the current term\nexpires on November 30, 2019. Under the lease we may enter into one more two-year extension term. Base rent during the initial term was $9.5 thousand\nper month but may increase by 3% of the then-current base rent during each extension term. Monthly rent payments for January 1, 2018, through\nNovember 30, 2018, were $10.4 thousand per month, and as of December 1, 2018, are $10.7 thousand per month through November 30, 2019. In addition to\nbase rent, we are responsible for our proportionate share of common area maintenance charges.\n- 42 -\nTable of Contents\nLEASEAGREEMENT\nIn connection with the Spinoff, we entered into a lease agreement dated November 1, 2014, with DriveTime that governs our access to and\nutilization of space at DriveTime inspection and reconditioning centers (“IRCs”) for vehicle inspection and reconditioning in Blue Mound, Texas, and\nDelanco, New Jersey, and previously for inspection and reconditioning in Winder, Georgia. The lease agreement was most recently amended in December\n2018. The agreement also governs utilization of office space and parking spaces at various IRCs and retail facilities that we use as hubs.\nUnder the amended lease agreement, hubs generally have cancellable two-year terms subject to certain two consecutive one-year renewal\noptions and subject to the terms of any master lease under which we are subleasing. We increased our utilization of the DriveTime IRCs in Blue Mound,\nTexas, and Delanco, New Jersey, to 100% as of July 2018. Under the lease agreement, we pay a monthly rental fee related to our pro rata utilization of\nspace at such facilities plus a pro rata share of each facility’s actual insurance costs and real estate taxes. As it relates to locations where we recondition\nvehicles, our share of facility and reconditioning-supplies expenses are calculated monthly by multiplying the actual costs for operating the inspection\ncenters by an amount related to our pro rata share of total reconditioned vehicles and parking spaces used at such IRCs in a given month. Total expenses\nrelated to this lease agreement were approximately $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nHOUSTON,TXVENDINGMACHINELEASEGUARANTEE\nOn July 14, 2015, DriveTime guaranteed our obligations under the lease governing our occupancy of the property on which our Houston\nvending machine is located. We do not compensate DriveTime for the guarantee. The initial lease term commenced January 8, 2016, and we began paying\nbase rent on May 7, 2016. Base rent during the initial term is $23.0 thousand per month, and the initial term expires on April 6, 2026. We have the option to\nextend the initial term for four additional consecutive five-year periods. Base rent during each extension term will increase 10% of the then-current base\nrent for each subsequent extension.\nTEMPE,AZOFFICELEASE\nIn September 2016, we entered into an agreement to lease the second floor of our corporate headquarters in Tempe, Arizona beginning April\n2017. Pursuant to this lease, we paid an initial monthly base rent of $107.0 thousand, which increases throughout the duration of the lease. The lease has an\ninitial term of 83 months and we have three 5-year extension options. At the request of the landlord, DriveTime agreed to partially guarantee our lease\npayments until the 30th full calendar month of the lease. We do not compensate DriveTime for the guarantee.\nIn connection with this lease, we entered into a sublease with DriveTime for our use of the first floor of the same building. Under the sublease,\nwhich is coterminous with DriveTime’s master lease and has a term of 83 months, subject to our right to exercise three 5-year extension options, we pay\nDriveTime rent equal to the amounts due under the master lease, including initial monthly base rent of $102.0 thousand, beginning April 1, 2018, which\nincreases throughout the duration of the sublease and master lease. Total expenses related to this lease agreement were approximately $0.9 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2018.\n- 43 -\nTable of Contents\nTOLLESON,AZINSPECTIONANDRECONDITIONINGCENTERLEASE\nIn December 2016, we entered into a lease agreement with Verde Investments Inc. (“Verde”), an affiliate of DriveTime, for an IRC in Tolleson,\nArizona. The lease commenced in February, 2017. In August 2018, we entered into an additional lease agreement with a coterminous initial term with\nVerde for contiguous space to use in connection with such center, which began that same month. The leases expire in December 2031 subject to our right to\nextend for four 5-year terms. Pursuant to the leases, we pay an initial base rent of $137.5 thousand per month, which is adjusted each year beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2018, and $57.1 thousand per month, which is adjusted each year beginning on January 1, 2020, respectively, each in accordance with the\nConsumer Price Index, subject to a minimum increase of 2% per year and a maximum increase of 5% per year.

Services provided to Carvana and its subsidiaries by Grant Thornton LLP for the year ended December 31, 2018 are described below\nand under “Audit Committee Report.”\nFEES AND SERVICES\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate fees for professional audit services and other services rendered by Grant Thornton LLP for the\nyears ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nSERVICES 2018 2017\nAudit Fees $1,524,986(1) $1,061,451(3)\nAudit-Related Fees $ — $ —\nTax Fees $ 349,220(2) $ 110,489\nAll Other Fees $ — $ —\n(1) Includes the aggregate fees for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements and internal controls, and the reviews of each of our quarterly\nconsolidated financial statements. These fees also include procedures performed related to our follow-on offering completed in April 2018,\nregistration of shares on Form S-3 in May and December 2018, and the issuance of our senior notes in September 2018.\n(2) Includes the aggregate fees for tax return preparation and other tax compliance services.\n(3) Includes $475,782 in fees related to our initial public offering in April 2017 that were reported in “All Other Fees” in our proxy statement prepared in\nconnection with our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.\nIn considering the nature of the services provided by the independent auditor, the Audit Committee determined that such services are\ncompatible with the provision of independent audit services. The Audit Committee discussed these services with the independent auditor and Carvana\nmanagement to determine that they are permitted under the rules and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by the SEC to implement\nthe Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\nThe Audit Committee has adopted a policy that requires advance approval of all audit services as well as non-audit services to the extent\nrequired by the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002. Unless the specific service has been previously pre-approved with respect to that year,\nthe Audit Committee must approve the permitted service before the independent auditor is engaged to perform it.\nThe Audit Committee approved all services provided by Grant Thornton LLP. Representatives of Grant Thornton LLP are expected to be\npresent at the annual meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and we expect that they will be available to\nrespond to questions.\n- 54 -\nTable of Contents\nRatification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP requires affirmative votes from the holders of a majority of the shares present in person\nor represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote. If Carvana’s stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP, the\nAudit Committee will reconsider the appointment and may affirm the appointment or retain another independent accounting firm. Even if the appointment\nis ratified, the Audit Committee may in the future replace Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm if it is determined that\nit is in Carvana’s best interests to do so.\nThe Audit Committee and the Board of Directors recommend that you vote “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as\nthe independent registered public accounting firm of Carvana for the year ending December 31, 2019.\n- 55 -\nTable of Contents\nA UDIT COMMITTEE REPORT\nThe Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. The Audit Committee is composed of three independent\ndirectors (as defined by the New York Stock Exchange Listing Standards), met nine times in 2018, and operates under a written charter, which is posted on\nour website at investors.carvana.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents. As provided in the charter, the Audit Committee’s oversight\nresponsibilities include monitoring the integrity of our financial statements (including reviewing financial information, the systems of internal controls, the\naudit process, and the independence and performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm) and our compliance\nwith legal and regulatory requirements. However, management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process,\nincluding our systems of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee\n• reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, with our management;\n• discussed with our independent auditors, Grant Thornton LLP, the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (“PCAOB”) Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees); and\n• received the written disclosures and the letter from Grant Thornton LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Grant\nThornton LLP’s communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Grant Thornton LLP the\nindependence of Grant Thornton LLP.\nBased on the Audit Committee’s review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the\naudited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRespectfully submitted by:\nIra Platt\nGregory Sullivan\nMichael Maroone\n- 56 -\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3 – SAY ON PAY\nWe are asking stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the\n“Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” the “Summary Compensation Table,” and the related compensation tables and narrative. This item is being\npresented pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although this advisory vote is not binding, the Compensation and Nominating\nCommittee will consider the voting results when evaluating our executive compensation program.\nOur executive compensation programs are designed to support our long-term success and reflect our pay-for-performance culture. Our company\nhas grown dramatically over the years. Our growth has few historical precedents and makes us one of the fastest-growing technology, consumer, or retail\ncompanies at our scale, and in 2018 we continued to grow rapidly, with another year of triple-digit unit and revenue growth while simultaneously making\nsignificant progress in gross profit per unit and accelerating our operating leverage. We have a strong belief in promoting a pay-for-performance culture,\nand, accordingly, as described in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” of this proxy statement, the Compensation and Nominating Committee has\nset challenging performance targets based not on last year’s achievements but continued rapid growth, and has structured our executive compensation\nprogram to tie total compensation to long-term stockholder value, as reflected primarily in our stock price. We believe that our executive compensation\nplans effectively support our strategic and financial goals, create a culture of teamwork, and are directly tied to the performance of the company and\nshareholder outcomes.\nThe Board recommends a vote “FOR” approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement.\nITEM 4 – SAY ON PAY FREQUENCY\nPursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking stockholders to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on\nexecutive compensation. Stockholders may specify whether they prefer such votes to occur every year, every two years, or every three years, or they may\nabstain. The Board recommends that this vote occur every year.\nAlthough the stockholders’ vote on this proposal is not binding, the Board will consider the voting results in determining the frequency of\nfuture advisory votes. Notwithstanding the Board’s recommendation and the outcome of the stockholder vote, the Board may in the future decide to conduct\nadvisory votes on a more or less frequent basis and may vary its practice based on factors such as discussions with stockholders and the adoption of material\nchanges to compensation programs.\nThe Board recommends stockholders vote, on an advisory basis, to conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation every “ONE YEAR.”\n- 57 -\nTable of Contents\nOTHER MATTERS\nWe are not aware of any matters other than those discussed in the foregoing materials contemplated for action at the annual meeting. The\npersons named in the proxy card will vote in accordance with the recommendation of the Board on any other matters incidental to the conduct of, or\notherwise properly brought before, the annual meeting. The proxy card contains discretionary authority for them to do so.\nINCORPORATION BY REFERENCE\nThe “Audit Committee Report” included in this proxy statement shall not be deemed soliciting material or filed with the SEC and shall not be\ndeemed incorporated by reference into any prior or future filings made by us under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we\nspecifically incorporate such information by reference.

In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers, and other employees\nof Carvana may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, facsimile, email, or other similar means.\n- 59 -\nTable of Contents\n100K MILESTONE GIFT\nANNEX\nOn September 10, 2018, we announced a commitment by our chief executive officer, Ernest Garcia III, to contribute 165 shares of Class A\ncommon stock to us from his personal shareholdings for every one of our then-existing employees upon their satisfying certain employment tenure\nrequirements. In connection with these contributions, we have made corresponding grants of 165 restricted stock units under our 2017 Omnibus Incentive\nPlan to each employee who has satisfied the requirements and intend to make grants to the remaining then-existing employees as they satisfy the\nrequirements (the “100k Milestone Gift” or “Gift”). Under U.S. GAAP, the 100k Milestone Gift is treated as compensation expense, a portion of which\nrelates to the production of our used vehicle inventory and is therefore capitalized to inventory and subsequently recognized within costs of sales when the\nrelated inventory is sold.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we also present the\nfollowing non-GAAP measures: gross profit ex-Gift, gross profit per unit ex-Gift, EBITDA ex-Gift, and EBITDA margin ex-Gift. We believe the\npresentation of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our\nmanagement team, and it also improves investors’ understanding of our underlying operating performance and their ability to analyze our ongoing operating\ntrends. All historic non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nGROSSPROFITEX-GIFTANDGROSSPROFITPERUNITEX-GIFT\nGross profit ex-Gift and gross profit per unit ex-Gift are non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and\nshould not be considered an alternative to gross profit, as determined by GAAP. Gross profit ex-Gift is defined as gross profit before compensation expense\nrelated to the 100k Milestone Gift included in cost of sales. Gross profit per Unit ex-Gift is Gross Profit ex-Gift divided by units sold. We use Gross Profit\nex-Gift to measure the operating performance of our business and Gross Profit per Unit ex-Gift to measure our operating performance relative to our units\nsold. We believe that Gross Profit ex-Gift and Gross Profit per Unit ex-Gift are useful measures to us and to our investors because they exclude the expense\nassociated with the 100k Milestone Gift recognized in cost of sales. We expect the 100k Milestone Gift to be a one-time award program for which we will\nrecognize varying amounts of expense beginning in the second half of 2018 and continuing through the first half of 2020, and therefore we believe the\nrelated expense does not reflect our core operations, is not included in our past operations, and may not be indicative of our future operations. Additionally,\nthe shares issued to settle the 100k Milestone Gift are offset by share contributions from Mr. Garcia to Carvana, therefore we expect the impact on shares\noutstanding to be nearly zero. We believe that excluding it enables us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period and relative to our\ncompetitors.\n- 60 -\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the gross profit ex-Gift amounts to each corresponding gross profit amount, which are the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasures and include expenses attributable to the 100k Milestone Gift, and calculations of each gross profit per unit ex-Gift amount are as follows (dollars\nin thousands, except per unit amounts):\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2018 2017 2016\nUsed vehicle gross profit $ 94,319 $32,806 $ 5,944\n100k Milestone Gift in used vehicle cost of sales 3,870 — —\nUsed vehicle gross profit ex-Gift $ 98,189 $32,806 $ 5,944\nUsed vehicle unit sales 94,108 44,252 18,761\nUsed vehicle gross profit per unit ex-Gift $ 1,043 $ 741 $ 317\nWholesale vehicle gross profit $ 5,552 $ 1,845 $ 257\n100k Milestone Gift in wholesale vehicle cost of sales 133 — —\nWholesale vehicle gross profit ex-Gift $ 5,685 $ 1,845 $ 257\nWholesale vehicle unit sales 15,125 6,509 2,651\nWholesale vehicle gross profit per unit ex-Gift $ 376 $ 283 $ 97\nTotal gross profit $196,709 $68,091 $19,197\n100k Milestone Gift in total cost of sales 4,003 — —\nTotal gross profit ex-Gift $200,712 $68,091 $19,197\nUsed vehicle unit sales 94,108 44,252 18,761\nTotal gross profit per unit ex-Gift $ 2,133 $ 1,539 $ 1,023\nEBITDAEX-GIFTANDEBITDAMARGINEX-GIFT\nEBITDA ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift are non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and\nshould not be considered an alternative to net loss or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP. EBITDA ex-Gift is defined as net loss before\ninterest expense,\n- 61 -\nTable of Contents\nincome tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and the compensation expense related to the 100k Milestone Gift. EBITDA margin ex-Gift is\nEBITDA ex-Gift as a percentage of total revenues. We use EBITDA ex-Gift to measure the operating performance of our business and EBITDA Margin\nex-Gift to measure our operating performance relative to our total revenues. We believe that EBITDA ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift are useful\nmeasures to us and to our investors because they exclude certain financial and capital structure items and the expense associated with the 100k Milestone\nGift that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring operations, in part because they may vary widely\nacross time and within our industry independent of the performance of our core operations. In particular, we expect the 100k Milestone Gift to be a\none-time award program for which we will recognize varying amounts of expense beginning in the second half of 2018 and continuing through the first half\nof 2020, and therefore we believe the related expense does not reflect our core operations, is not included in our past operations, and may not be indicative\nof our future operations. Additionally, the shares issued to settle the 100k Milestone Gift are offset by share contributions from Mr. Garcia to Carvana;\ntherefore, we expect the impact on shares outstanding to be nearly zero. We believe that excluding these items enables us to more effectively evaluate our\nperformance period-over-period and relative to our competitors. EBITDA ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures provided by other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculations. A reconciliation of EBITDA ex-Gift to net loss which\nincludes 100k Milestone Gift expense and is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and calculation of EBITDA margin ex-Gift is as follows (dollars\nin thousands):\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2018 2017 2016 2015 2014\nNet loss $(254,745) $(164,316) $(93,112) $(36,780) $(15,238)\nDepreciation and amortization expense 23,539 11,568 4,658 2,800 1,706\nInterest expense 25,018 7,659 3,587 1,412 108\n100k Milestone Gift 11,821 — — — —\nEBITDA ex-Gift $(194,367) $(145,089) $(84,867) $(32,568) $(13,424)\nTotal revenues $1,955,467 $858,870 $365,148 $130,392 $41,679\nNet Loss Margin (13.0)% (19.1)% (25.5)% (28.2)% (36.6)%\nEBITDA Margin ex-Gift (9.9)% (16.9)% (23.2)% (25.0)% (32.2)%\n- 62 -\nANNUAL MEETING OF CARVANA CO.
