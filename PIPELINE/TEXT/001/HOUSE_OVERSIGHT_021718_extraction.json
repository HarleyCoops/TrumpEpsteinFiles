Prod� Oirect:of Hedy Szabo, Business Manager\nWhat a city owes its reside·nts\nThough it is the biggest city in\nU.S. history to file for bankruptcy,\nDetroit is only one' of 26 urban\nmunicipalities that qave gone into\nbankruptcy or state rec�ivership for\nfiscal insolvency since 2008. Detroit\nshould draw attention and debate to\na challenging issue underlying all\nthese public insolvencies: What\nlevel of public services will we protect\nand guarantee for U.S. cities?\nThe Bankruptcy Court will have\nto fa ce that question. It will have to\ndetermine whether Detroit can cut '\ninto current services any more than\nit already has. Unless. the state or\nfederal government steps in with\nfunds for operating costs, the bahkruptcy\nwill function as a zero-sum\ngame, with residents fighting creditors\nfor a share of city revenue.\nCreditors have contracts to monetize\nwhat they are seeking, but how\nshould the court detennine the public\nspending that residents need\ntoday 'and tomorrow?\nPoliticians and judges who manage\nlocal fiscal crises speak of\nmaintaining basic services and\ne'nsuring residents' minimal health\nand safety, but these concepts are\nsbort on specifics. While our laws\nprovide an entitlement to a public\neducation, and we have long struggled\nto interpret what constitutes a\nlegally adequate ed�cation, there is\nlittle to nothing that would tell us\nwhat other services the local public\nsector must provide.\n. As a matter of law, ther,e is no\nsuch thing as a crime rate that is too\nhigh or an ambulance response time\nthat is too long. Should tbere be?\nFor now, it is left: to politics and\nmora/ judgment to determine whether\nit is acceptable that less than one\nin three streetlights are operational\nin Detroit O( that th� city has 80,000\nabandoned and blighted structures\nthat it cannot afford to demolish. In\nDetroit, as in many other struggling\ncities, dramatic police layoffs mean\nthat the average wait time after a\n911 call for a police officer is 58 .\nminutes, and a resident can rarely\nsummon an officer at all jf the\n. reported crime is not in progress and\nviolent.\nAs for other public functions that\na high-poverty city (especially one\nwith..severe winters) might hope to\nhave - such as reliable bus service,\nplayground equipment, indoor\nbasketball F0urts, after-school programs,\nactive libraries and community\ncenters for the elderly - these\nMichelle Wilde Anderson\nservices are decades into deep cuts '\nand widespread closures. Indeed,\nhaving curtailed everything beyond .\nemergency services, it would be\ntempting to refer to a government\nlike Detroit's as a night-watchman\nstate - the libertarian ideaJ of a\ngovernment focused only on publ'ic\n. safety,\nThat is, we'd be tempted 'to use\nsuch a term for Detroit, and cities\nlike it, were it not such a cruel irony:\nDetroit had'more than 15,200 violent\ncrimes and, 500 acts of arson in\n2012. The night watchmen are\nunderstaffed and underpaid.\nAccording to a 2012 study by economists\nAaron' Chalfin and Justin\nMcCrary, public spending in Detroit\non each police officer (including all .\nwages, benefits and retirement costs)\nis less than 'two-thirds what it is just\n45 miles away in the prosperolls\nuniversity town of Ann Arbor.\nAs a political and moral matter, as\nmuch as a legal one, Detroit represents\nan opportunity to take a stand·\nfor urban habitability. What belongs\non our list of minimum standards for\na city? Detroit invites us to have a\npublic conversation about what services\nand public spaces we expect\nfrom city governments for human\ndignity and for humans to flourish,\nWe have a chance to say that no one\nshould have to wait hopelessly for\nan ambulance, that a violent crime\nin a neighborhood every few hours\n. is intolerable.\nPaying for such commitments\nshould not just be the burden of\ncreditors, Many of the city's creditors\nare rank-and-file public employees\nand reHrees who have counted\non a public pension and are not eligible\nfor Social Security. Detroit's\nbankruptcy plan could send them\ninto poverty in their old age.\nBasic services and safety in our\ncities are the responsibility pf\nstates, the fe deral government, the\nprivate sector and voters. It is all of\nthem - alt of us - who have a\nrole to play in the stabilization that\nDetroit ·is seeking. through bankruptcy.\nAll of us have a responsibility\nto help them give basic ·health\nand safety real meaning, and to\nmake this bankruptcy a safety net,\nnot a punisliinent.\n- Michelle Wilde Anderson is .an\nassistant professor of law ..at UC\nBerkeley School of Law.\nMrs. Anthqny We iner is Hillary 2.1\nI sat there watching the television\nscreen as Anthony Weiner squirmed\n.\nthe weight of the offenSive conducl.\n• •\nChnstme M.
