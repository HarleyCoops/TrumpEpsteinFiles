[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: Fwd: Alert: The 2017 Tax Reform Act \nImportance: High \nRichard Kahn \nHBRK Associates Inc. \n575 Lexington Avenue 4th Floor \nNew York, NY 10022 \ntel \nfax \ncell \nTAX ALER JANUARY 23, 2018 \nThe 2017 Tax Reform Act - Key \nProvisions Impacting Fund Managers \nand Their Funds \nFor further information about this Alert, \nplease contact: \nAlex Gelinas \nPartner \n212.573.815g  \nagelinas@sglawyers.com \nSteven Etkind \nPartner \n212.573.8412  \nsetkind@sglawyers.com \nPlease feel free to discuss any aspect of \nthis Alert with your regular Sadis & \nGoldberg contact or with any of the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026778 \npartners whose names and contact \ninformation can be found at the end of \nthe Alert. \nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), which was signed into law by President Trump on December \n22, 2017, contains the most sweeping federal tax law changes since 1986. Most provisions of the Tax \nAct take effect for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. This Client Alert is not intended \nto be a comprehensive review of this massive legislation. The Alert focuses on certain provisions of \nthe Tax Act that may have the most significant impact on asset management firms, their owners, their \ninvestment vehicles, and the investors in such funds. Certain changes made by the Tax Act are \npermanent but many others are scheduled to expire after 2025 unless extended by further \nCongressional legislation. \nI. Carried Interest Survives in Modified Form \nThe Tax Act contains changes to the treatment of \"carried interests\", but such changes are not as \nnegative as the prior legislative changes that had been proposed but never adopted. The granting of a \n\"future profits only\" interest in a partnership in connection with the performances of services to the \npartnership continues to be eligible for tax-free treatment under the new law. For certain owners of \n\"Applicable Partnership Interests\" (of the sort that would generally be issued by an investment \npartnership to the general partner), the Act applies a three-year holding period requirement for capital \ngains derived by the partnership (or from the disposition of the profits interest) to be eligible for the \nlong-term capital gains tax rate (instead of the generally applicable one-year holding threshold). \nThe change in carried interest taxation clearly impacts managers of hedge funds more than managers \nof private equity funds or real estate funds, which typically have a longer than three-year holding period \nfor investments in their portfolio companies or real estate assets. The new tax treatment applies to \nincome realized in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and existing carried interests are not \ngrandfathered. Thus, it appears that any unrealized capital gains which have already been allocated to \na general partner on the books of the partnership would be subject to the new tax treatment at the time \nthe partnership realizes such gains in 2018 or subsequent years. \nNote, however, that the Tax Act does not change the current federal income tax treatment of carried \ninterest allocations of \"qualified dividends\" to individuals, which are also taxed at long-term capital gains \nrates. The capital gains from the carried interest that fail to satisfy the new three-year holding period \nrequirement are treated as \"short-term capital gains\" which are taxable at ordinary income rates. \nThe \"Applicable Partnership Interest\" held by the general partner or an affiliate should not include any \nportion of the partnership interest that is attributable to capital contributed to the partnership by the \ngeneral partner. The exact manner on how such exception will apply will need to be addressed in future \nIRS notices or regulations to be issued. Limited partners holding capital interests in private investment \nfunds are also not affected and therefore retain the one-year holding period requirement for long-term \ncapital gain treatment. \nNote also that the term \"Applicable Partnership Interest\" does not include an interest held directly or \nindirectly by a corporation and it currently appears that such exception includes holdings by both C \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026779 \ncorporations and S corporations. It is likely that further guidance will be issued on this question, as it \nmay be advantageous for certain general partners to convert their existing entities that hold the carried \ninterest to S corporations, and such general partners may have until March 15, 2018 to accomplish such \nconversion. \nManagers of hedge funds and other partnerships that do not hold capital assets for more than three \nyears before their sale may consider whether the carried interest incentive allocation should be replaced \nwith an incentive fee structure. Also, the reduced after-tax value of a carried interest partnership \nallocation may impact the management company's executive compensation arrangements. \nAlthough an earlier version of the tax legislation would have repealed the exemption in the Code which \nprovides that a limited partner's income is exempt from self-employment tax, the final version of the \nTax Act does not contain such change in law. \nII. New 21% Corporate Income Tax Rate and Reduction of the Maximum Rates Applicable to \nIndividuals \nThe Tax Act reduces the 35 percent corporate rate to a flat 21 percent corporate rate. There is no special \nhigher rate for personal service corporations (as existed under prior law). The new 21 percent rate is \neffective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The corporate alternative tax (AMT) \nhas also been repealed. Such corporate tax changes are permanent. In contrast, the highest applicable \nfederal income tax rate for individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers is reduced from 39.6% to \n37%. In addition, the 3.8% \"add-on\" Medicare contributions tax on an individual's net investment \nincome remains in effect. \n1. Possible Use of a \"C\" Corporation as a Tax Shelter \nSince the new 21% corporate tax rate is now well below the highest rate applicable to high income \nindividuals, some investment managers may conclude that some or all of their management entities \nthat are pass through partnerships should convert to corporate form. In addition, certain partnership \nfunds that are engaged in trade or business, such as active loan origination or real estate activities may \nfind it advantageous to convert to corporate form. \nThe advantage to the corporate form of organization is that the C corporation's net income after taxes \nis not taxable to its shareholders until it is distributed (e.g., either as a dividend or as a redemption of \nstock (i.e., as a capital gain)). Corporations that are engaged in active businesses are able to retain and \nreinvest their earnings. Also relevant to choice of entity decisions is the fact that the Tax Act restricts \nthe ability of individuals to deduct more than $10,000 in state and local taxes, but corporations can \ncontinue to deduct such taxes as under prior law. \nHowever, there are certain anti-abuse provisions that remain in the Internal Revenue Code that limit \nthe use of a C corporation as a tax shelter. Lurking in the Code is a provision which allows the Internal \nRevenue Service to impose a 20 percent additional \"accumulated earnings\" income tax on the \n\"accumulated taxable income\" of a corporation if such taxable income is allowed to accumulate \"beyond \nthe \"reasonable needs of the business\". There is a $250,000 safe harbor for most corporations, while \npersonal service corporations are allowed a safe harbor of only $150,000. There is also a 20 percent tax \non the \"personal holding company income\" (i.e., passive investment income) of certain closely held C \ncorporations (i.e., when five or fewer individuals own, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent of the \ncorporation's stock and at least 60 percent of the corporation's adjusted ordinary income is personal \nholding company income (e.g., passive investment income)). These penalty taxes on corporations have \nreceived little attention in recent decades. However, with the enactment of the sharply lower corporate \ntax rate, these anti-abuse rules are likely to become a significant focus of the IRS in its audits of tax \nreturns of privately held corporations. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026780 \n2. The New Deduction for Qualified Business Income of Pass Through Entities \nCongress also wanted to provide an income tax rate reduction for those businesses that are organized \nas partnerships or S corporations or which are owned by sole proprietors. In order to meet this goal, the \nTax Act provides an income tax deduction for individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers equal to (i) \n20 percent of their domestic \"qualified business income\"; plus (ii) 20 percent of any qualifying dividends \nfrom real estate investment trusts, qualifying income from publicly traded partnerships, and gain \nderived from sale of such publicly traded partnerships that would be treated as ordinary \nincome. Therefore, such deduction results in an effective federal income tax rate of 29.6% on such \nqualifying income for a top bracket individual. The deduction does not apply to investment income (i.e., \ncapital gains, dividends (other than certain ordinary income dividends paid by REITs), and most interest \nincome). In addition, it does not apply to reasonable compensation income and guaranteed payments \npaid to the taxpayer from the business. \nThe 20 percent of \"qualified business income\" deduction described in (i) above is also generally limited \nto the greater of either (a) 50% of the W-2 wages paid with respect to the qualified trade or business, \nor (b) the sum of 25% of the W-2 wages paid with respect to such business plus 2.5% of the unadjusted \ntax basis of all qualified business property of such business. Thus, if the partnership, S corporation or \nsole proprietorship does not pay \"W-2 wages\" and the second limitation is a minor amount or not \napplicable, the owner or pass through taxpayer's tax deduction would be a minor amount or zero. \nUnfortunately, partners or owners of certain types of professional service businesses, including \nfinancial services providers, investment managers, brokers, consultants, lawyers and accountants (and \nothers), are not permitted to claim the \"qualified business income\" deduction unless the taxpayer's \nadjusted gross income is below certain levels ($207,500 for individuals and $365,000 for married couples \nfiling jointly). Even in such case, the benefit of the available deduction is phased out ratably as the \ntaxpayer's income exceeds $157,500 if single, or $315,000 if filing a joint tax return. Therefore, fund \nmanagers organized as pass through entities are not likely to, and investment funds organized as \npartnerships will not, derive a significant benefit from this deduction. \nISSUES FOR PARTNERSHIP FUNDS \n1. Repeal of Itemized Deductions Previously Available to Non-Corporate Taxpayers for Non-Business \nInvestment Expenses \nFor 2018 through 2025, the Tax Act completely repeals the deductions previously allowed to individuals \nand other non-corporate taxpayers for \"miscellaneous itemized deductions\" (which were subject to a \n2% floor and a phase-out rule under prior law). It is important to note that for individual investors in \npartnership funds that are not treated as engaged in a trade or business, the investor's share of the \nfund's investment expenses, including management fees, would now pass through as non-deductible \nmiscellaneous itemized deductions. If the fund is properly classified as an active \"trader\" rather than a \nmere investor, then such expenses would be completely deductible as trade or business expenses. This \nTax Act change obviously puts considerable strain on the fund manager and its tax advisors with respect \nto the trader vs. investor issue. At this time, there is a lack of clear guidance from the Internal Revenue \nService on what level of trading activity is sufficient for a professionally managed fund to qualify as a \n\"trader fund\". \nIn cases where a partnership fund's expected activities are not likely to qualify for trader status or \nanother trade or business, the fund's sponsor may find that US high net worth individuals may now \nprefer to invest in the offshore corporate feeder fund instead of the onshore partnership fund. The US \nincome tax reason for this would be that since the offshore feeder is classified as a corporation for US \ntax purposes, its net income would be calculated under the rules applicable to corporations, for which \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026781 \nthere are no miscellaneous itemized deductions. Thus, assuming that the foreign feeder is a passive \nforeign investment company (PFIC), if the US high net worth shareholder is able to make the \"qualified \nelecting fund\" election, the net income the investor would be required to report on his federal income \ntax return would be calculated after deducting all of the corporation's expenses, including management \nfees and investment expenses. \n2. Non-US Partner's Gain on Sale of Partnership Interest may be Taxable as US Trade or Business \nIncome; New Withholding Requirements apply to the Purchaser or the Fund \nThe Tax Act specifically provides that gains realized by a non-US partner on a sale or exchange of a \npartnership interest will be treated as effectively connected US trade or business income (\"Ed\") to the \nextent that such partner would have been allocated [Cl had the partnership sold all of its assets. This \nprovision is consistent with the IRS position in Revenue Ruling 91-32, and overrules a recent Tax Court \ncase which had rejected the position taken in such IRS Ruling and instead held that since a partnership \ninterest is treated as a capital asset, the foreign person's gain on its sale could escape US income taxation \nas a non-business capital gain. \nTo the extent that a partnership has any [Cl-generating assets (including US real property interests), a \nseller of a partnership interest will have to provide a certificate that it is not a foreign person, and in the \nabsence of such a certificate a purchaser (which could include the fund) will be required to withhold \n10% of the gross purchase price. Further, the Tax Act provides that if the purchaser does not withhold, \nthe partnership is required to withhold on distributions to such purchaser to cover the withholding. The \nTax Act provides that the new withholding obligation for purchasers is effective for sales or other \ndispositions of partnership interests after December 31, 2017. \n3. New Limitation on Deduction of Net Interest Expense \nUnder prior law, subject to some restrictions and limitations, business interest paid or accrued by a \nbusiness was fully deductible. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act limits \nthe deduction for \"net business interest\" expense for every type of business, regardless of entity form, \nto 30 percent of adjusted taxable income. Business interest paid or accrued after the effective date on \nindebtedness, including debt that was incurred prior to the effective date of the Tax Act, is subject to \nthis limitation. \nThe term business interest does not include investment interest described in Code section \n163(d). Operating companies, such as management entities, and investment funds that are engaged in \na business and have outstanding indebtedness could be subject to such deduction limitation. For this \npurpose, \"adjusted taxable income\" is determined at the entity level for partnerships, and is similar to \nEBITDA (i.e., net earnings before deducting interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for \ntaxable years 2018 through 2021. A more restrictive 20% of [BIT limitation (net earnings before \ndeducting interest expense and taxes) applies for 2022 and later years. \nCertain taxpayers are exempted for the new interest deductibility limitation, including small businesses \nwith average annual gross receipts of $25 million or less for the three prior taxable years, as well as real \nestate businesses that elect out of such limitation. The Conference Committee Report on the Tax Act \nclarified that interest paid on shareholder loans by a blocker corporation is \"business interest\" that is \nsubject to this new limitation. Blocker corporations for a lending business would have business interest \nincome, which reduces the effect of this new limitation on net business interest expense (i.e., deductible \nbusiness interest expense in excess of business interest income). \n4. Deemed Repatriation Tax \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026782 \nOne of the major tax raising provisions in the Tax Act is a one-time tax imposed on the accumulated \nearnings held in foreign subsidiaries of US companies. This provision is broader that it may first \nappear. Under the Tax Act, any 10% US shareholder of a foreign corporation (determined on December \n31, 2017) will be required to include in income, for the taxable year 2017, its proportionate share of the \nforeign corporation's undistributed earnings, if the foreign corporation is either a controlled foreign \ncorporation (CFC) or has at least one 10% US shareholder that is a corporation. \nThis law change could generate significant phantom income with respect to 10%-or-greater owned \nforeign portfolio companies both (i) for US taxable investors (including the general partner and its \nowners) in partnership funds organized in the United States and/or for US sponsors of non-US \nfunds. The Tax Act provides for reduced tax rates on such income for corporate investors of 8% (for \nearnings invested in tangible business assets) and 15.5% (for cash and cash equivalents), and 9.05% and \n17.54% for investors taxed as individuals. \n5. Tax-Free Section 1031 Like Kind Exchanges Eliminated Except for Real Property Transactions \nThe Tax Act eliminates the ability to qualify for tax-free exchange treatment under Code section 1031 if \nthe property being exchanged is personal property. Consequently, for transactions occurring after \nDecember 31, 2017, exchanges of artwork, equipment, vehicles or other personal property held for \ninvestment or for use in a business, including Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, for like kind property \nwill not eligible for Section 1031 tax treatment. Exchanges of real property continue to be eligible for \nSection 1031 exchange treatment. \n6. Certain Tax Accounting Rules Have Been Revised \nUnder prior law, net operating losses (NOLs) could be carried back two years and carried forward for \ntwenty years. Under the Tax Act, NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 generally \ncannot be carried back, but can be carried forward indefinitely. However, only 80% of a company's \ntaxable income is permitted to be offset by NOLs. The remainder of the unused NOLs will carry forward. \nThe Tax Act also expands the category of corporations and partnerships that are eligible to use the cash \nmethod of accounting. Certain businesses may derive a tax benefit by switching from the accrual \nmethod to the cash method of accounting. \n7. Deferred Compensation \nThe Tax Act generally leaves the current tax rules for deferred compensation intact. However, the Act \nalso includes a new deferral provision for certain types of broad-based employee equity, which may \napply to certain private companies. \n8. Estate and Gift Tax Changes \nIn 2017, an individual could give or transfer at death up to $5,490,000 without paying gift or estate taxes. \nThe Tax Act doubles the federal estate and gift tax unified exemption amount for estates of decedents \ndying and gifts made after December 31, 2017, and inflation adjustments will continue to \napply. Therefore, in 2018, an individual has approximately an $11.2 million exemption, and a married \ncouple has approximately $22.4 million of available shelter from federal gift and estate taxation. Note \nthat the large exemption which applies to gifts may be useful in federal income tax planning. For \nexample, large lifetime gifts of appreciated securities, artwork and other personal property (including \npossibly, a carried interest) to relatives who are in lower income tax brackets, or who reside in states \nwith lower, or no state income taxes could save the family substantial federal income and/or state \nincome taxes when such property is sold by the recipient of the gift. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026783 \nSadis & Goldberg LLP \nPlease feel free to discuss any aspect of this Alert with your regular Sadis & Goldberg contact \nwhose names and contact information are provided below. \nAlex Gelinas, 212.573.8159, agelinas@sglawyers.com  \nDaniel G.
