In our view, a Republican sweep would\nfirst lead to JPY strength on risk aversion, but eventually be the most bullish outcome for\nthe USD/JPY. The price action last week – a shallow dip – tells us two things about the\nUSD/JPY. First, the view that a GOP sweep would boost the USD/JPY was probably more\nwidely shared than we had thought, so a dip failed to stretch. Second, there may be\nmore potential USD/JPY buyers than sellers, which is in stark contrast to last year, when\nthere were many more potential USD/JPY sellers than buyers (Case for a stronger yen in\n2016 18 December 2015). The “buy-on-dip” cycle in USD/JPY is likely to continue as we\nexpect the pair to reach 115-120 by end-2017. We remain constructive about Japanese\nequities and see banks, insurance continue outperforming REITs near-term.\nInvestment Strategy\nJapan\nShusuke Yamada, CFA >>\nFX/Equity Strategist\nMerrill Lynch (Japan)\n+81 3 6225 8515\nshusuke.yamada@baml.com\nPaul Ciana, CMT\nTechnical Strategist\nMLPF&S\n+1 646 855 6007\npaul.ciana@baml.com\nHigher US rates (esp. if steepening) to boost USD/JPY\nUSD/JPY performs best at the time of UST bear-steepening as better risk sentiment\nreduces the JPY’s safe haven demand and a wider yield spread increases the USD\ndemand from Japanese investors (Exhibit 2). For our US strategists, the clean sweep\nmeans fiscal easing and higher rates, supporting their higher real rate view (A win for\nbond bears and USD bulls 09 November 2016). The USD/JPY has recently tracked real\nyield spread closely (Chart 1), and the pair is gradually producing higher carry as\nmonetary policy is diverging between the US and Japan (Chart 2). In Japan, fiscal easing\nis also a possibility in light of reduced odds of TPP implementation and a potential early\nsnap election. Any positive impact of Japanese fiscal easing on growth is likely to\nmanifest itself in higher inflation expectations under the BoJ’s yield-targeting regime,\nwhich means Japanese real interest rates can actually fall.\nUnauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\nWatch Abe-Trump meeting – coordination or conflict?\nGiven the high uncertainty, clarifications on Trump’s policies on trade and currency will\nbe important for the Japanese market going forward. A potential Abe-Trump meeting in\nNew York this Thursday (17 Nov), as reported by Japanese media, warrants attention. We\nsuggested that Trump presidency could potentially reduce flexibility of Abe's political\nand diplomatic strategy, reduce positive market risk from Japanese politics, and increase\nnegative risk from Japan's national security. But this is not known until we see actual\nTrump presidency. If the President-elect shows an understanding for the existing Japan-\nUS alliance and refrains from protectionist rhetoric, it could reduce concerns about\ndeterioration of the bilateral relationship, supporting USD/JPY and potentially exporter\nshares (though reduced odds of TPP implementation is unlikely to change drastically).\nTrading ideas and investment strategies discussed herein may give rise to significant risk and are not\nsuitable for all investors.

This is the opposite of the situation some months ago (USD/JPY’s\ndownside risk to 110 – sell on rally 10 February 2016). First, CFTC speculative position\nremains yen long though short-term traders are probably positioned for the upside\nalready (Chart 3). Second, we believe domestic activity to raise hedge ratio has run its\ncourse as the USD/JPY swept through the sensitive level this year. As 2HFY16 (Oct ‘16-\nMar ‘17) has started, most life insurance companies are reportedly inclined to increase\nexposure to unhedged foreign bonds though they generally remain price sensitive. In our\nview, this is reflected in the USD/JPY’s consolidation during Tokyo trading hours after\nthe pair hit 100 on the Brexit vote (Chart 4). The fact that USD/JPY has failed to break\n100 multiple times since then suggests the market looking for USD/JPY’s dip, light\npositioning, and the market’s judgment that USD should be more expensive than 100\nJPY. The market is probably more vulnerable to the USD/JPY’s upside than downside.\nChart 3: CFTC non-commercial futures position (bln USD)\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\nEUR GBP CHF CAD NZD AUD JPY\nNov '15 Nov '16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nChart 4: USD/JPY cumulative % change by trading zone\nDuring Japan Trading Hour(8am-4pm Tokyo)\n% GOP\n6\n4\n2\nNY Hour (0am-8am Tokyo)\nLondon hour (4pm-12pm Tokyo)\nsweep\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-8\n-10\n-12\n-14\n-16\n-18\n-20\nBrexit\n-22\nNov-15 Jan-16 Mar-16 May-16 Jul-16 Sep-16 Nov-16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nTechnical: constructive\nDaily overbought momentum (RSI) is overall a positive for USD/JPY’s uptrend.\nOverbought conditions can persist longer in uptrends, but at some point this could\n2 Japan Macro Watch | 14 November 2016\nreverse.

The insurance sector has been the best performer since the US election on the\nback of a steeper US Treasury curve and higher rates. Michael Hartnett observes\n“violent rotation out of deflation to inflation plays”, including a move from REITs to US\nbanks. This should apply to Japan, where banks and insurance have underperformed\nREITs amid relentless fall of the long-term yield and introduction of negative interest\nrate by the BoJ (Chart 5). The domestic policy condition has changed, however, as the\nBoJ is now reluctant to cut rate as it pays greater attention to the health of the financial\ninstitution. The BoJ now intends to prevent the yield curve from flattening excessively.\nWhile higher foreign yields may not lift yen rates as the BoJ controls the 10-year sector,\nreflationary environment outside Japan at least reduces the risk of a deeper cut at home.\nOutperformance of Japanese equities at the time of UST bear steepening has\nhistorically been led by cyclicals, banks and insurance (Exhibit 2). David Gleeson is\ncautious about REITs, while Futoshi Sasaki is constructive on banks. The move can\nstretch further near-term.\nExhibit 2: US Treasury curve (2s10s) move and market performance (past 43 quarters simple average, %) – USD/JPY, Japan equity (local ccy term), and Japanese cyclical, bank,\ninsurance tend to outperform at the time of UST bear-steepening\nUSDJPY\nDollar\nindex\n(DXY)\nMSCI\nJapan\nMSCI\nJapan /\nex Japan*\nJapan sector*\nDiscretion\nFinancials Materials\nary\nIT Industrials Energy Telecom Staples Utilities\nHealth\ncare\nBear steep 4.12 -0.60 8.58 3.32 11.68 9.97 9.96 9.46 8.58 5.88 3.27 2.86 2.83 1.89\nBear flat 1.90 0.31 3.88 0.58 3.49 -0.44 5.44 4.09 3.88 4.26 3.66 2.34 -0.06 5.21\nBull steep -1.85 -0.35 -2.32 -2.76 -3.03 -2.44 -4.70 -4.22 -2.32 -3.46 2.44 1.44 -3.64 -0.47\nBull flat -4.49 1.26 -7.31 -5.05 -8.91 -11.10 -9.94 -8.23 -7.31 -9.61 -0.37 -1.50 -4.16 -1.59\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nUsed Bloomberg Treasury yield index.\nCurve movements defined based on 2yr move (up or down) and 2s10s move (up or down) so these include twist movements, but even if we exclude these, implications for USDJPY and Japan equity do not change\nsignificantly.\n11 quarters of bear steepening = average 16bps increase in 2yr yields and 33bps 2s10s steepening; 10 quarters of bear flattening = average 26bps increase in 2yr yields and 20bps 2s10s flattening; 10 quarters of bull\nsteepening = average 48bps decline in 2yr yields and 28bps 2s10s steepening; 12 quarters of bull flattening = average 27bps decline in 2yr yields and 30bps 2s10s flattening\nJapan / ex-Japan = MSCI Japan / MSCI Kokusai ratio\nJapanese sectors follow MSCI definition\nChart 6: If inflation, rates surprise to upside, Japanese banks likely to outperform REITs\n2.3\n2.1\n1.9\n1.7\n1.5\n1.3\n1.1\n0.9\n0.7\n0.5\nNov-06 Nov-07 Nov-08 Nov-09 Nov-10 Nov-11 Nov-12 Nov-13 Nov-14 Nov-15 Nov-16\nBank/Reit\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n4 Japan Macro Watch | 14 November 2016\n3 risks – reality vs hope, higher yields, politics\nThe biggest risk to our view is that actual US fiscal easing turns out to be minimal. But\nwe believe the USD/JPY’s move will be quicker than whatever reality emerges in coming\nmonths. China’s unexpected RMB devaluation or any explicit rhetoric to guide USD\nweakness by the new US administration could eventually trigger significant JPY strength.\nThe other risk is a rapid increase in US long-term yields triggers risk-off trade,\nsupporting Japanese yen. However, we believe a potential correction in US equity is\nunlikely to reverse the medium-term direction of USD/JPY (though it could cause a\nshort-term pullback as our technical analysis suggests) because higher yields and\nUSD/JPY are backed by fundamentals for now –prospect for fiscal easing. Finally, politics\nis a significant concern. The President-elect has previously criticized the Japan-US\nsecurity alliance. A shift away from the Japan-US security alliance could lead to higher\ngeopolitical risk for Japan. It could also lead to more defense spending and expansion of\nJapanese military capability and could lift prospect for fiscal expansion. A combination\nof higher geopolitical risk and defense spending is probably less bearish USD/JPY than\nJapanese equities.\nJapan Macro Watch | 14 November 2016 5\nDisclosures\nImportant Disclosures\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%\nNeutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%\nUnderperform N/A ≥ 20%\n* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend.
