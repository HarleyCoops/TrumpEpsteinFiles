But in the course of conversations I've had recently, as a I research a new book \non President Trump and the forces arrayed against him, what has become clear is that Robert Mueller and his \noffice are preparing for a life or death confrontation with the President and the mother of all constitutional \ncrises. \nMy discussions have been with both White House advisors and people close to the investigation. No source \ninvolved in this story would speak on the record. \nThe sources firmly believe that Special Counsel has ready an aggressive legal theory for the indictment of \nthe president for obstruction of Justice. In the last few weeks, as the President has indulged his pardon \nauthority, the Mueller team has also developed a legal strategy to oppose the ikely pardon of former National \nSecurity Advisor, Michael Flynn, who had previously struck a plea bargain which could include his testimony \nagainst the President. \nRobert Mueller, according to one person familiar with the Special Counsel's thinking, could hardly contain \nhis disgust when Rudy Giuliani, the President's new lawyer—hired to makes a television case for the President \nand to push back against the Mueller team—in May airily dismissed the notion that a president can be indicted. \nAdding insult to injury, Giuliani—who a White House source said had likely learned of aspects of the pending \nindictment—said Mueller agreed with that assessment. White House sources believe Giuliani was daring the \nSpecial Counsel to tip his hand. Mueller, in character, contained his outrage and continued to hold his cards \nclose as his team finished preparing the obstruction case and refined the legal theories under which it would \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030402 \nclaim the right to haul the president into court. \nThe Mueller team, according to sources both near the investigation and the White House, has prepared a \ncase, but it requires the approval of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who—with the recusal of \nAttorney General Jeff Sessions from the Russia-related investigation—oversees the Mueller team. He would \nneed to set aside He could do this based on a finding that the former opinion was inaccurate re the president \nbeing above the law. ttherby creating an inability to indict a sitting president. Indeed, Rosenstein, as recently \nas April, publicly declared that the President was not a target. This may have been a form of fig leaf to soothe a \nPresident who regularly demands aides assure him he is not being pursued: the President does not become a \nformal target until Rosenstein agrees to designate him as one. \nAny proposed indictment would confront Rosenstein with matters with which he has been intimately \ninvolved. The case, according to my conversations , is fundamentally Trump versus the FBI, Justice \nDepartment, and Mueller investigation itself. In many ways, it boils down to the word of former FBI Director \nJames Comey against the word of Donald Trump. Rosenstein, at the President's behest, drafted a memo \njustifying the Comey firing for how the former FBI Director handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation. \nBut that justification, in an embarrassment for Rosenstein, was shortly brushed aside by the President when he \nadmitted that he fired Comey to disrupt the Russian investigation. What's more, the indictment is said to charge \nthat the firing of Andrew McCabe, the former Deputy Director of the FBI, who reported directly to Rosenstein \nafter the Comey dismissal, was an instance of illegal retaliation tampering or consipracy by the President \nagainst a potential witness. \nAccording to a source with knowledge of the strategy, it will be all the more controversial because if finds \nthe entire narrative of the case for obstruction in plain sight. Almost nothing about the case involves new \ninformation. \"This indictment could have been drafted without anyone being interviewed,\" said this source. \nRather it takes well covered public events and moves them to a set of circumstantial conclusions. There is no \nsmoking gun beyond the often flagrant, custom-breaking, events of the President's 16 months in office. Indeed, \nmuch of the evidence is based on the President's public statements and tweets about those events. \nThis is, according to White House sources who have gotten wind of this approach, good news: the case then, \nis just an issue of what motives you ascribe to the President's behavior—behavior that is, the President's \nsupporters believe it is easy to show, impulsive and not thought out. Hence no intent. For the Mueller team, it \nis precisely that careless behavior and flagrant disregard for the rules that they aim to put on trial. \nThere is no certainty that the Special Counsel's office will ultimately pursue its plan to indict the President. \nBut, according to a source the worry is that the plan is \"more advanced\" than previosly believed. . The \ninvestigation continues and new evidence or other factors might push both prosecutors and the grand jury in \nanother direction. Just passing its first anniversary, the Mueller investigation has conducted itself with \nremarkable secrecy. Descriptions of a proposed indictment provide one of the few insights into its strategy and \nits sense of the political peril in front of it. \nIt may be noteworthy that there appears now not to be plan for an indictment related to collusion, although, \nlegal experts say, that could come later. \nThe White House view is that without the underlying collusion charge, Mueller will be presenting a weak \nand politically-motivated case. The Mueller view seems to be that the obstruction charges go to the heart of \nexposing how Trump has abused his power and turned the White House into a corrupt fiefdom. \nThe President's scheme to obstruct the FBI's investigation into connections between the Trump campaign \nand Russian efforts to undermine the U.S. election, according to Mueller began on the 7th day of the Trump \nadministration. Three days prior to this, on January 24, National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, lied to the \nFBI about his contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. These were contacts, directed by an \nunnamed person. \nThat unnamed person, in the view of several lawyers who discussed the case with me, is very likely Trump \nhimself, and might imply that Trump encouraged Flynn to lie to the FBI, promising to protect him—using his \ninfluence or pardon powers. \nOn January 27th, seven days after Donald Trump's inauguration, the President had the one-on-one dinner \nwith FBI \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030403 \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
