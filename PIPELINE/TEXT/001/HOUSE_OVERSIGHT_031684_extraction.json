Rybolovlev purchased it for $127 million in 2013 through his art dealer, the \nSwiss businessman Yves Bouvier. Bouvier, the owner and operator of several freeports, \nbought the painting for $80 million with the intention of selling it to Rybolovlev at a steep \nprofit. Its owner before Bouvier, the New York City-based gallerist Robert Simon, found \nthe painting at an estate auction in New Orleans in 2005. He paid just $10,000. \nOn Thu, May 30, 2019 at 5:41 PM Michael Wolff • wrote: \nYou have an art guy? \nOn Thu, May 30, 2019 at 5:40 PM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nIn addition my art guyd said the painting wasn't very good \nOn Thu, May 30, 2019 at 5:37 PM Michael Wolff •cflEll wrote: \nStarting to smell sweet, the way you put it! \nOn Thu, May 30, 2019 at 5:35 PM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nreminder trump overuled congress on yemen. \nOn Thu, May 30, 2019 at 5:33 PM Michael Wolff wrote: \nSo MBS was paying him off?
