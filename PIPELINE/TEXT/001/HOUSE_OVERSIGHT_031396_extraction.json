Boyd to Sen. Ben Sasse (R-\nNeb.), who has questioned how the department handled its inquiry of\nfinancier Jeffrey Epstein.\nEpsteinʼs case had been the subject of an investigation by the Miami\nHerald, which detailed how then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, now\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-justic…1718903bfc_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.c9ebae38dfe7\n2/6/19, 7I29 PM\nPage 1 of 3\nPresident Trumpʼs labor secretary, shelved a 53-page indictment that\ncould have put Epstein behind bars for life.\nEpstein, who counts among his friends Trump and former president Bill\nClinton, assembled a high-powered legal team to address the\nallegations he faced. Ultimately, he pleaded guilty in 2008 only to state\ncharges of soliciting prostitution. Victims told the Herald they felt\nbetrayed by the arrangement.\nThe departmentʼs newly announced investigation is likely to be of\nlimited consequence. According to Boydʼs letter, it is being handled by\nthe Office of Professional Responsibility, which explores allegations of\nemployee wrongdoing. The officeʼs findings, at worst, typically result\nin employees being fired, and they are not usually made public, though\nBoyd wrote to Sasse that the office would “share the results with you\nat the conclusion of its investigation as appropriate.” It is possible,\neven likely, the investigation could drag on so long that Acosta, already\noutside the Justice Department, would by then be out of government\nentirely.\nIn a statement, Sasse said: “The victims of Epsteinʼs child sex\ntrafficking ring deserve this investigation — and so do the American\npeople and the members of law enforcement who work to put these\nkinds of monsters behind bars. Parents should be grateful for the men\nand women at the DOJ who are committed to transparency and\naccountability and for the soon-to-be Attorney General who is\ncommitted to pursuing justice.”\nA representative for Acosta, who did not respond to requests for an\ninterview for the Heraldʼs investigation, did not immediately return a\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-justic…1718903bfc_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.c9ebae38dfe7\n2/6/19, 7I29 PM\nPage 2 of 3\nmessage seeking comment for this report.\nMartin G. Weinberg, an attorney for Epstein, said in a statement that\nEpsteinʼs plea was “fairly negotiated by experienced teams of\nattorneys representing each party.”\n“It was anything but a sweetheart deal,” Weinberg said. “And it was\ncarefully and fully reviewed not only by senior prosecutors within the\nSouthern District of Florida Office but also at multiple levels of the\nDepartment of Justice in D.C.”\nThe government, he said, “avoided litigation risks including the risks of\nan acquittal and Mr. Epstein went to jail, served a period of probation,\nlived up to each and every obligation under the Agreement, and has\nfully conformed his conduct to the law for well over 10 years.”\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-justic…1718903bfc_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.c9ebae38dfe7\n2/6/19, 7I29 PM\nPage 3 of 3\n"
