While his victory is highly likely, the question remains—down which \npath will he take Egypt? Al-Sisi's support for the anti-Morsi protesters \nmay indicate support for the democratization of Egypt and the will of the \npeople. On the other hand, his bid looks like a giant leap backwards for \nEgypt, a return to a military dictatorship. Egypt has several potential paths \nforward under an al-Sisi government, none of which are ideal. \nUnfortunately, Egypt appears to be justifying analysts' worst fears and \nwill likely return to a Mubarak-style military autocracy under al-Sisi. \nThe first option is a military government that enacts economic and \npolitical reforms that improve the lives of the citizenry, not just the \nmilitary or the elites. This will lead to a slower evolution toward \ndemocracy. On the plus side, slower evolution under a stable government \nwould allow structural changes to take root, fostering effective institutions \nand greater stability. The negative side is that evolution of this sort would \nbe neither smooth nor straightforward. It would come in fits and spurts, \npunctuated by returns to oppression and violence. It would also be \nextremely slow, and easy for a demagogue to reverse. Unfortunately, \ngiven Egypt's current situation, option one is highly unlikely. Given the \nhigh levels of repression and violence, the only reforms the government \nwill likely enact would involve greater centralized power in its hands. \nFurthermore, there are a myriad of ways for a government to pay lip \nservice to democratization without actually decreasing its power. Another \noption is that Egypt becomes stuck in a proverbial time loop—repeating \nthe revolution every year or two when the government fails to deliver on \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031570 \nactual, on-the-ground improvements. This would not necessarily make \nEgypt worse off, but it could further weaken the economy as revenue from \nkey industries, such as tourism, continues to decline. It would not improve \nconditions either, as improvements, unfortunately, take longer that the \nvoting public generally likes. The potential upshot of this option is that, \nhopefully, over time, mass action would become more and more cohesive \nand leaders start to emerge from the morass. This would bring developed \npolitical parties into Egypt's political system and potentially, leaders from \noutside the military and the elite as well. This, however, will remain only a \ntemporary option. Revolutions, or even mass action, are difficult to \nmaintain over time. Moreover, if some improvements, particularly \neconomic improvements, do occur, the majority of the country will \nacquiesce to a nondemocratic government. The best example of this is the \nChinese government, which has managed economic growth without any \naccompanying political liberalization. Eventually, either a government \nwill improve conditions for the average Egyptian, or it will become so \nrepressive that mass action ceases to be a viable option. The third option is \na total crackdown on any and all political movements and the return of a \nrepressive and autocratic government. The impetus behind this path is the \nidea that establishing stability is the first and foremost priority of the \ngovernment. If you establish stability, the rest will follow. Or, if the \ngovernment is truly cynical, it simply does not care what happens as long \nas the ruler and his or her cronies are taken care of Right now, it looks as \nthough Egypt has chosen to go with option three, the return to repression \nunder military rule. The first step for any autocracy is to get a firm grip on \nthe political process, weeding out the opposition. This is precisely what \nhas been occurring. Massive repression of the Muslim Brotherhood is the \nmost obvious example of this process. While there are some legitimate  \nsecurity concerns regarding the Muslim Brotherhood ties to ongoing  \nviolence, banning the entire organization and labeling them all as terrorists \nis like using a sledgehammer on a nail—overkill and likely to create a \nmess. It does, however, have the benefit of getting the only meaningful \npolitical party out of the current political scene and that is a key step in \npolitical consolidation. Other examples of consolidation abound, including \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031571 \nharsh treatment of dissents and a crackdown on journalists. While Egypt \nis headed down the path of autocracy, this does not suggest the futility of \nchange or of promoting democracy in Egypt, nor, say, that the Arab \nSpring was a failure. Autocracy will not be a permanent fix for the factors \nthat nourished the Arab Spring. It will work for a while, maybe even a \ndecade, but eventually, repression will not be enough, and the \ndemonstrations will begin again. A little liberty is a dangerous thing—\nespecially when it bears fruit. The Arab Spring in Egypt may not have \nbrought about democracy, but that does not mean it failed. Egypt now \nknows the impact mass action can have on its government. They have seen \nnot one, but two governments fall as a direct result of protests and popular \naction. Egypt may be moving back toward a military dictatorship, but now \nthe people have a taste of liberty. No matter how repressive the military \nestablishment decides to be, the genie is out of the bottle. \nKathryn Alexeeff holds a master's degree in Security Studies from \nGeorgetown University and has worked at the Atlantic Council's South \nAsia Center. \nArticle 2.  \nNow Lebanon \nWhat Saudi-Iran talks could mean for \nLebanon and the region  \nAlex Rowell \nMay 16, 2014 -- In a potentially momentous surprise move that could \nherald an alleviation of political and sectarian conflict across the Middle \nEast, Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal announced on \nTuesday an invitation to his Iranian counterpart to travel to Riyadh to enter \nnegotiations over the rival countries' \"differences.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031572 \nSaudi and Iran, powerhouses of Sunni and Shiite Islam respectively, \npresently support opposing sides in many of the Middle East's major \nconfrontations, and are often seen as having radically divergent and \ncompeting visions for the future of the region. \nWhich is why, in Lebanon — a country where the two powers wield \nextensive influence over their respective allies — the news of a possible \nrapprochement has already sparked confidence that political deadlock on a \nnumber of key disputes may be resolved, perhaps even defying \nexpectations of a presidential vacuum by ushering in a successor to \nPresident Michel Suleiman in time for the expiry of his term on 25 May. \n\"I [now] believe we will have an elected president on the 25th,\" said MP \nAhmad Fatfat of the Saudi-supported Future Movement. \"That [Prince \nFaisal's] invitation was public means they already agreed on many points \nunder the table. That means the negotiations regarding the new president \nhave already been done.\" \nBeyond the elections, Fatfat added the talks would likely also yield wider \nbenefits in terms of security and the economy. Earlier this week, Saudi \nlifted what has been described as an \"unofficial ban\" on its citizens \ntraveling to Lebanon, fueling hopes of a boost to the country's struggling \ntourism industry. Saudi analysts concurred that the overall situation in \nLebanon would likely improve in the near future. \n\"I think in Lebanon there is already agreement [between Saudi and Iran],\" \nsaid Jamal Khashoggi, veteran Saudi journalist and former advisor to then-\nambassador Prince Turki al-Faisal. \"The agreement in Lebanon is to \ncontain the situation.\" \nIn neighboring Syria, however, where Iranian-backed regime forces \ncontinue to suppress a Saudi-supported armed rebellion, Khashoggi \nexpects very little to materialize from Saudi-Iranian talks. \n\"I'm not optimistic,\" he told NOW. \"The Saudis and Iranians are still far \napart. The Iranians must relinquish their expansionism toward the \nMediterranean, or we have to give up Syria. And I don't think we can \nafford to give up Syria. And besides, even if we decide to give up Syria, \nthe Syrian people are not going to give up Syria.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031573 \n\"So basically, the Iranians are acting like the Israelis — they want peace, \nand they want to keep the land.\" \nOther analysts, while conceding any progress would be slow, had \nsomewhat more positive forecasts on the Syrian front. \n\"[Syria] is a tough one to happen quickly, but at least if they start talking \nthen it's a good thing,\" said Andrew Hammond, policy fellow at the \nEuropean Council on Foreign Relations and author of The Islamic Utopia: \nThe Illusion of Reform in Saudi Arabia. \n\"Fundamentally, the chances of the Syrian tragedy being brought to an \nend, or the beginning of this disaster being brought to an end, require these \ntwo countries to come to an agreement [...] They are the keys to the \nSyrian conflict, so they have to start talking, even though it will take a \nlong time.\" \nAccordingly, with little chance of the two reaching agreement on Syria in \nthe immediate future, the talks may in fact focus on other areas of dispute, \nsuch as Iraq, where a new coalition government is being formed following \nparliamentary elections on 30 April. \n\"The other issue is Iraq, now that the election is over and all the horse-\ntrading is beginning,\" said Hammond. \"I wonder whether that actually \nmay have been the main impetus for this invitation.\" \nPerhaps the most significant changes resulting from Faisal's initiative in \nthe long run, however, will pertain to Saudi itself Having been \"shocked,\" \nas Hammond put it, by the United States' decision to pursue warmer ties \nwith Tehran last year, and initially threatening a \"major shift\" in its \nrelations with Washington as a consequence, Riyadh may now be \ngrudgingly coming to terms with the new order envisaged by President \nObama. \n\"It does suggest there is a potential for them to reassess the situation and \ntry and move things forward, find some way of having a new relationship \nwith the Iranians, given the fact that the Americans clearly want to move \nforward, and the smaller Gulf states do as well,\" said Hammond. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031574 \nAlex Rowell joined NOW in Beirut as a reporter and blogger in February \n2012. A British citizen, he was raised in Dubai and studied economics in \nLondon. \nArticle 3. \nThe Economist \nIndia's next prime minister: The Modi era  \nbegins  \nMay 18th 2014 -- IN THE days since May 16th when Narendra Modi and \nhis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stormed to victory in India's general \nelection much commentary has wrestled with the idea of history. Most \ncommentators seem to agree that May 2014 marks an historic moment. \nOne reason is the scale of Mr Modi's landslide victory, which scooped up \n282 seats for the BJP and thus an absolute majority in parliament. That is \nfirst time since 1984 that any party has won a majority for itself It is also \nthe first time ever that a party other than Congress has done so. \nConversely, the defeat for Congress is far worse than anything in its long \nhistory of dominating Indian politics: it won fewer than a sixth the seats of \nits rival, getting just 44. In much of north India, the political heartland, \nCongress was wiped out. Some correctly ask if its eventual recovery \n(assuming that will happen one day) would require being rid of the Nehru-\nGandhi dynasty that has been at its heart for so long. \nYet the size of Mr Modi's victory, and Congress's defeat, tells only part of \nthe dramatic story. The immense dissatisfaction with Congress was \nundeniable. Voters were unhappy with high inflation, slowing growth, \nweak leadership, corruption and much more. Such voter grumpiness, \nusually summed up as \"anti-incumbency\", is all but inevitable for a party \nthat had been in power for a decade. Yet more has happened here. Take, \nfor example, the utter defeat of the Bahujan Samaj Party of Mayawati, the \nDalit leader in Uttar Pradesh. She was not an incumbent and her party \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031575 \nmanaged to collect some 20% of the votes cast in the state. Indeed, after \nthe BJP and Congress, it got the most votes nationally of any party in the \nelection. Yet it failed to win a single constituency. By contrast the BJP not \nonly collected a huge tally of votes but also turned those efficiently into \nseats. With 31% of the national vote-share, they captured nearly 52% of \nthe seats in parliament. \nThat suggests an important shift in Indian politics. The BJP did \nextraordinarily well because it approached the election in a far more \nprofessional, strategic and efficient way than its rivals. The methods it \nemployed were modern, and the skill at which Mr Modi and his fellow \nleaders conducted their campaigns rivalled the sort of performances put in \nby American presidential contenders (and with similar quantities of money  \nto spend). Rahul Gandhi of Congress, in the end, proved to be a hopeless \namateur, poorly advised without even decent media-management skills or \nthe ability to present a strong campaign message. Many regional figures \nproved similarly out of date in their campaigning. The BJP's roadshows \nand rallies, the door-knocking by volunteers, the influence on India's press \nand television channels, the ability to set the agenda of discussion, all went \nto making the election a remarkably one-sided affair. The chief minister of \nBihar, Nitish Kumar, tendered his resignation on May 17th, after his party \nwas flattened by the BJP in the state. (Assam's chief minister, from \nCongress, has also offered to quit.) That was not because of anti-\nincumbency—voters in Bihar are happy with the work Mr Kumar has \nbeen doing—but because the BJP's campaign was vastly superior. \nMr Modi in his first speeches after his victory has sounded magnanimous \nand made the right noises about running the country for all, bringing \neveryone along. He also mentioned, only partly accurately, that the BJP's \nsuccess transcended caste politics and religious appeals. If that were \nentirely true, it would be another reason to call this election result historic. \nIn fact the BJP did make some use of caste and religion, as when Mr Modi \nplayed up his \"other backward classes\" background while campaigning in \nUttar Pradesh, or when he criticized Bangladeshi (read: Muslim) \ninfiltrators in Assam and West Bengal. It is troubling, too, that the new \nparliament will have the fewest Muslim members of any since 1952, while \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031576 \nthe ruling BJP has not a single Muslim MP among its cohort of 282; \nMuslims are reckoned to comprise at least 14% of the Indian population. \nBut largely Mr Modi told the truth: the BJP's manifesto and Mr Modi's \nspeeches emphasised economic and development matters. The victory he \nachieved is more the result of his talk of strong government and \nimprovements to the material lives of voters than anything else. That is \nencouraging. It suggests that he will now seek to govern in a way that \nencourages economic growth, job creation and better infrastructure, along \nwith further reductions in poverty and inflation. Mr Modi has been \ndropping strong hints that he hopes to remain in power not only for the \ncurrent five-year term, but to win re-election and reshape India's economy \nand political landscape. In other words, he is considering his long-term \nprospects by keeping in mind the rise of a powerful new constituency that \nwill only gather more influence as the years pass: the young, urban, \neducated and impatient set of voters who aspire for material gains to their \nlives. We argued before that such voters, for whom there is only \"one \nGod, that is GDP\", will increasingly decide the outcome of Indian \nelections. Mr Modi and the BJP look set to corner their support. \nWhat comes next? On May 20th the BJP will meet, apparently to elect Mr \nModi formally as their leader. That, apparently, is a precursor to the \nformation of a government which is going to include the immediate allies \nof the party that make up the National Democratic Alliance. It could, too, \nbe made from of a wider coalition, since the BJP—if it is to push through \nlegislative changes quickly—will need additional help from other parties \nthat control powerful states, and to win more support in the upper house of \nparliament. \nUnease persists about the role of the Hindu-nationalist right, whose \nfootsoldiers undoubtedly helped a great deal in getting BJP candidates \nelected. With Mr Modi having been an activist member in the right-wing \nRashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) since he was a boy, some on the \nright have expectations that he will pursue an agenda of Hindutva (for \nexample getting a temple erected in Ayodhya, or changing the \nconstitutional status of Muslim-majority Kashmir). Others look for \nevidence that nationalism of a protectionist variety will have a strong \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031577 \ninfluence on Mr Modi's policies. For example over the weekend BJP \nspokesmen have been saying that the party still intends to reverse an \nexisting policy that would allow foreign investors to open supermarkets in \nlarger cities, and even then only under limited circumstances. \nMr Modi would be wiser to downplay the influence of both sorts of \nnationalists. To sustain confidence that he can get the economy growing \nfaster will require pulling off some difficult feats, not least attracting more \nforeign capital into a host of industries which could include insurance, \nbanking, defence and many parts of infrastructure. He needs to send a \nclear message, as he picks ministers and begins to offer policy, that India \naspires to become strong on the back of economic growth, more \ninternational trade, deeper global engagement—and not by promoting \nnationalist tendencies at home. He has a decent record of reaching out to \nother countries, notably Japan, in his time as chief minister of Gujarat. \nSince his victory on May 16th he has fielded calls from Barack Obama, \nDavid Cameron and a host of other global well-wishers eager to engage \nIndia internationally. Mr Obama for example made clear that India's \nprime minister would be welcome to visit the United States. The \nAmericans in particular want a decisive break from an earlier period, when \ninteraction with Mr Modi concerned his record in handling communal \nviolence in his state in 2002. Mr Modi in other words, by winning so \nemphatically on May 16th, appears both to have made history and escaped \nit. That is no mean feat at all. \nArticle 4. \nThe Christian Science Monitor \nAn India ready to dream big  \nEditorial \nMay 18, 2014 --Years before Narendra Modi won this month's election \nthat now allows him to become India's next leader, the former tea-stall \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031578 \nworker asked this question on behalf of the world's second most-populous \nnation: \n\"It is often said that India does not dream big and that is the root cause of \nall our problems. Why can't we dream like China, Europe or America?\" \nNote how Mr. Modi compares India to other continental powers. This \nreveals just how much today's 1.25 billion Indians, who are digitally \nhitched to the global flow of ideas, have adopted new views of their \ncapacity for progress — not only for India but for themselves. \nDuring his campaign, Modi tapped into this rising aspiration for India to \nemulate the best in other countries. One in eight voters went to the polls \nfor the first time, a sign of the fact that two-thirds of the population is \nunder 35. He and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised economic \ngrowth, clean governance, and decisive leadership, all of which Modi \ndelivered as chief minister of Gujarat state — although sometimes too \nharshly or divisively. \nHis record and his campaign promises really reflect an India ready to join \nthe global community. Voter turnout was a record 66 percent. And the \nelectoral results cut across the old divides of caste, rural vs urban, old vs. \nyoung, poor vs. middle-class. On those measures alone, India has \nsurpassed China, which is not even allowed to have elections, and the \npolitical disunity in Europe and America. \nThe BJP's election sweep was achieved in part out of public frustration \nwith the long-ruling Congress party. Its corrupt, paternalistic, and dynastic \nstyle no longer fits an India of smart phones and social mobility. More \nthan two-thirds of Indians are dissatisfied with their country's direction, \naccording to a Pew poll. In throwing off the past, voters have allowed the \nBJP to rule with a clear majority in the lower house of parliament. Such a \nfeat was achieved only once before, in 1984, after the assassination of \nIndira Gandhi boosted the Congress party in an election. \nAs prime minister, Modi must not forget he is riding an awakening of \nIndian expectations as much as leading them. His checkered past as a \nHindu nationalist, and in sometimes treating India's Muslims as less than \ncitizens, cannot color his leadership in a constitutional democracy. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031579 \nReligion, including Hinduism and Islam, can help Indians define their \nindividual identity. But in a country of such size and diversity, one that is \nhome to a third of the world's poor, only secular rule can ensure the unity \nneeded to fulfill people's collective hopes. \n\"India has won,\" Modi tweeted after his victory. This apparent humility \nmay serve him well in preventing an overreach of his powers. India does \nnot need big-man style rule now that a historic election has shown Indians \nare ready to dream big. \nArticle 5. \nHiirriyet \nWill it be Cyprus' year?  \nYusuf Kanli \n19 May 2014 -- The highlight of the one-day trip to North Cyprus by \nForeign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu might best be his bold declaration that \ntime has come to end the 50-year-old Cyprus problem. Can there be \nrelevance between the age and the time for the resolution of a problem? \nObviously not, but a minister expressing conviction that time has come to \nend a problem carries incredible importance and naturally boosts \nexpectations to that end. \nIs it really the high time, best opportunity, right moment, last chance or \nwhatever for a Cyprus deal? All through the past many decades, somehow \nmany prominent and otherwise effective personalities, including not only \nDavutoglu and people of his caliber, but many premiers, presidents and at \nleast every American leader since George Bush Sr. have declared many of \nthe past years as the \"Cyprus year\" but that Cyprus year never came... \nWill it come this time? Sure... the Cyprus problem could easily be \nresolved if the two sides on the island ever develop sufficient political \nwill; prepare their respective societies to be receptive to a painful \ncompromise and international actors stop paying lip service to the idea of \na resolution, but instead genuinely support a resolution. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031580 \nDo the two sides on Cyprus have political will? Does Turkey want a \nsettlement? Is Greece prepared for a deal that might trigger a larger deal \nwith Turkey over the Aegean and Thrace issues? Of these questions only \none element is affirmative; Turkish Cypriots want a settlement. In 2004, \nthey not only demonstrated simultaneous referenda, but repeated polls \nhave shown since then that the pro-settlement resolve of Turkish Cypriots \nis over 65 percent. Greek Cypriots? Polls show a decreasing 41 percent are \nreceptive to the idea of resolution, less than 30 want federation. Officially, \nboth Greece and Turkey support a compromise deal on Cyprus. How \nsincere are they? Last time, in 2004, despite all of the pledges made \nbefore, Greece eventually could not support a plan for resolution. Will it \nsupport a compromise deal this time? Let us hope it will. Turkey will \nsupport any deal supported by Turkish Cypriots, provided it somehow \nmaintains a presence on the island. Why should it not, after all, if Britain, \na country far away, has two sovereign bases just because it was the \nprevious colonial power? Was it not Turkey that leased the island to \nGreece? \nInternational actors all keep on vowing to support a deal on Cyprus. Why \nwould the British want a settlement knowing that despite the recent \nagreement it signed in haste with the Greek Cypriots, British bases on \nCyprus will be the next and joint target for all Cypriots if ever they resolve \ntheir bilateral quagmire? Russians would not want a resolution either. \nWhy should they? To upset their peculiar position as the major energy \nsupplier of Europe, (particularly) to Germany? Or to render life even more \ndifficult to the Russian population and collaborators engaged in bleaching \nbusiness? \nWhy would Americans support a compromise deal if they benefit more \nfrom the British bases on the divided Cyprus? The upcoming visit of \nAmerican Vice President Joe Biden this week and the anticipated visit to \nthe island within weeks by Secretary of State John Kerry of course \ndemonstrate an interest in the Cyprus problem. A visit by a U.S. vice \npresident — the first in 52 years — of course will be meaningful. \nPlans to ease European energy dependency on Russia might play a role for \nan accelerated demand for a Cyprus deal push. Don't the Americans know \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031581 \nbetter than anyone else a Cyprus peace requires engagement in goodwill \nand determination by both sides and of course at least Turkey, if not \nTurkey and Greece together? Why would Greek Cypriots want a \nresolution as long as they enjoy alone the \"sole legitimate government\" of \nCyprus and the Turkish Cypriot part of the island is considered only as \n\"areas not under the government's control?\" \nYes, Davutoglu may wish to see accelerated peace talks and a \ncommitment from Nikos Anastasiades to work for a deal \"as soon as \npossible.\" In view of the latest European Court of Human Rights and these \nplain realities, can that be possible anytime soon? \nArticle 6. \nThe National Interest \nStars Are Aligned for a Solution in Cyprus  \nOzdil Nami  \nMay 19, 2014 -- The Cyprus problem is at a critical juncture as there \nexists a unique opportunity for its solution. If this opportunity is utilized, a \nunited Cyprus will be the keystone of a wider area of cooperation and \nstability in the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. A glance at the issues \nthat are affected by or directly resulted from the prolongation of the \nproblem clearly highlights the need for an early settlement in \nCyprus. \nThe 50th Year on the UN Agenda \nThe Cyprus problem has been on the agenda of the United Nations for \nhalf-a-century. For decades, it has consumed considerable diplomatic and \npolitical effort, domestic and international alike, but to no avail. As such, \nit has gained a reputation as an intractable and inexorable problem that \neluded an ultimate settlement. The island of Cyprus, nearly half the size of \nthe state of Connecticut, has subsequently become synonymous with \nconflict, despite its nostalgic narrative as a haven of peaceful coexistence. \nSince the drawing of the Green Line in 1963, Nicosia, the Janus-faced \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031582 \ncapital of both North and South Cyprus, remains today as the last divided \ncity in Europe and the only divided capital in the world. However, the \nCyprus problem has to change face and move on from this conundrum \ncharacterized by a relentlessly enduring state of conflict to an inspirational \nsuccess story of peace. Time is ripe for such a change, especially in view \nof current dynamics that are molding together both on the island and in the \nregion. \nMissed Opportunities \nApril 24, 2014 marked the 10th anniversary of the referenda held on the \nUN Comprehensive Settlement Plan (the Annan Plan) on both sides of the \nisland. This was the first time in the history of Cyprus negotiations that a \ncomprehensive settlement document, comprising 9,000 pages, was put to \nseparate simultaneous referenda. The Turkish Cypriots accepted the plan \nwith an overwhelming majority (65 percent), despite the great sacrifices it \nentailed for them. They did not only vote in favour of a solution, but also \nfor moving beyond the traumatic past and building a common future \nwithin the EU through a new partnership with Greek Cypriots. \nUnfortunately, the Plan failed due to the resounding 'no' vote (76 percent) \nof the Greek Cypriots. Nevertheless, the Turkish Cypriot aspiration for a \nsolution has prevailed even in the face of deep frustration ensuing the \nGreek Cypriot rejection of the Annan Plan and the continued isolation \nimposed on Turkish Cypriots in all aspects of life. The fact that they have \nbeen left out in the cold, while the Greek Cypriot side has unilaterally \nbecome a member of the EU, did not change the Turkish Cypriots' resolve \nfor settlement. Yet, it further complicated the prospects of reconciliation \non the island. \nThriving Opportunities from Within \nAgainst this background, the Turkish Cypriot side has intensified its \nendeavors to overcome this crisis of confidence and engaged sincerely \nwith the Greek Cypriot side for the preparation of the ground for a new \ndialogue. Subsequently, the two sides were able to initiate a series of \nagreements in early 2008, which paved the way for the resumption of full-\nfledged negotiations after a four-year stalemate. Since then, intermittent \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031583 \nnegotiations have been underway, with significant progress attained on the \nmajority of the chapters of the Cyprus problem as a result of the intensive \nefforts put forward by the two sides in reaching convergences. \nFurthermore, with the recent agreement on the Joint Declaration of \nFebruary 11, 2014, an important milestone in the negotiations has been \nreached, which clearly provides for the broad outline of a solution and the \nmain principles upon which the new partnership will be established. \nHence, the announcement of the Joint Declaration triggered a very \npositive atmosphere that was further fostered by the support of a wide \nspectrum of actors on both sides as well as the extensive espousal received \nby the international community. \nThe Far-Reaching Consequences of the Problem \nIn light of this promising political climate on the island, combined with \nthe existence of some external factors that are currently at play, there is an \nhistoric opportunity that should not be missed in bringing the long-\noverdue Cyprus problem to a closure. The recent developments in our \nregion strongly signal a pressing need in this direction. It is beyond doubt \nthat the Cyprus problem holds back the potential of cooperation in a \nbroader context. Since its conception, the relations between Turkey and \nGreece have been negatively affected by it. A full-scale rapprochement \nbetween the two countries has been held hostage to the chronic status quo \non the island. In the course of time, this has been exploited as an excuse to \noppose Turkey's bid for EU membership through the blocking of some \nchapters in her accession talks. EU-NATO strategic cooperation has also \nbeen hampered in a similar fashion due to the non-existence of diplomatic \nrelations between South Cyprus and Turkey. As a NATO member, Turkey \nhas proven to be an indispensable strategic partner of the Transatlantic \ncooperation since the inception of the Cold War. Although a NATO \nCouncil decision in late 2002 enabled the participation of the non-EU \nmembers of NATO in the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), \nthe Greek Cypriot side has been blocking Turkey's involvement both in \nthe ESDP and her prospective membership in the European Defense \nAgency (EDA). As a result, no meaningful dialogue can practically be \nestablished between the EU and NATO, creating a situation whereby the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031584 \nCyprus problem is literally obstructing the deepening of the EU-NATO \nstrategic relations. The current crisis in Ukraine clearly highlighted, once \nagain, the need for closer cooperation between the two institutions. \nExternal Dynamics Necessitating a Settlement \nThe crisis in Ukraine also brings forward the necessity of alternative \nenergy supplies en route to Europe. Recently, the island of Cyprus has \ndriven considerable attention as a result of the newly found energy \nreserves in the Eastern Mediterranean. Common sense dictates that \nTurkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, together with neighboring countries, \nadopt a win-win approach and share the benefits of the natural resources \nof the region on an equitable basis. Such cooperation and the resulting \ninterdependency could only bring much needed stability and prosperity to \nthe region and help restore the ties between Turkey and Israel. \nThe Promise of a Solution \nCyprus lies at a strategic crossroads between the East and the West. \nHowever, as all these developments indicate, the island's full potential can \nonly be utilized with the solution of the Cyprus problem. A solution will \nnot only provide for peace on the island, but will also prompt a wave of \ncooperation in its wider region. Therefore, all relevant actors, including \nthe two sides on the island, should act in a spirit of good-will and \ncompromise in bringing an end to this half-century-old problem. The \nTurkish Cypriot side is ready to do its utmost in this regard, with a view to \nrealizing the island's destiny to become a hub for peace and stability rather \nthan a source of conflict and tension. \nOzdil Nami is the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Turkish Republic of \nNorthern Cyprus. \nArticle 7. \nThe diplomat \nChina's Instructive Syria Policy \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031585 \nAdrien Morin \nMay 18, 2014 -- The crisis in Syria erupted early in 2011 as part of the \nArab Spring and worsened as the year went on. A first draft resolution to \nintervene in Syria was proposed by France, Germany, Portugal and the \nU.K., on October 4. This proposal was vetoed by Russia and China, \nmarking the start of a long diplomatic impasse with Moscow and Beijing \non one side and the Western powers on the other. China and Russia would \nlater veto two more draft UN resolutions. Three years after the clashes in \nSyria began, and with the civil war now being supplanted in media \nheadlines, it is worth reviewing Chinese policy. Has Beijing purposefully \nbeen more assertive toward Western powers, and the U.S. in particular? \nWestern Concerns \nChinese foreign policy worries the West on a number of fronts. One \nconcern is the formation of a \"united front\" of China and Russia, to \noppose Western goals. Certainly, China and Russia have together vetoed \ndraft resolutions supported by the three other permanent members of the \nSecurity Council. The world has meanwhile witnessed China's impressive \nrise in recent decades as well as Russia's attempts to return to Great Power \nstatus. Perhaps an anti-Western alliance of those two actors could indeed \nchallenge the U.S. and its allies. In the meantime, the West finds itself \nfrustrated by Chinese foreign policy pragmatism, or as the critics would \nhave it, the absence of values. This is de facto incompatible with Western \nmoral ideals, which invoke human rights or other ethical arguments. \nChinese realpolitik is seen as amoral, if not immoral. Chinese policy is \nalso not up for domestic debate — a lack of transparency and little civic \nengagement make sure of that. Those who fear that Chinese foreign \npolicy is driven by the intent of challenging (and eventually supplanting) \nthe West would view Beijing's support for the Syrian regime as \nideological. This concern rises as China becomes more popular in the \nMiddle East. Mostafa Kamel, a member of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, \n\"expressed admiration for China's position and proposition on the Syrian \nissue and said that Egypt is willing to strengthen communications and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031586 \ncoordination with China on the issue.\" Could the influence of Western \npowers in the region be weakened, for the benefit of China? All these \nconcerns come back to one issue: China's new role within the \ninternational community. As a new — and still growing — power, some \nobservers fear that China may soon have the ability to challenge and \nthreaten the Western liberal model that has dominated international \norganizations since the end of the Cold War. \nThe Reality \nThese concerns are misplaced. First, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) \nhas a high level of suspicion toward Western proposals at the international \nlevel and within the executive organs of the United Nations in particular. \nChina seems to view the UN as a potential tool to oppose what it considers \nWestern interventionist policies around the world, and it is clear that the \nChinese government was greatly disappointed when the United States and \nits allies acted on their own to impose, by force, a regime change in Iraq in \n2003. The frustration was even greater during the Libyan crisis that ended \nwith the overthrow and execution of former leader Muammar Gaddafi. \nIndeed, from Beijing's perspective, resolution 1973 of the United Nations \nseeking to impose a no-fly zone in Libya did not give any foreign power \nthe right to intervene militarily on Libyan territory and against the Libyan \nregime. Beijing learned a lesson. The second element may be more \nimportant: Beijing's stance on the Syrian crisis is consistent with China's \nlong-term foreign policy and its fundamental principles. The basis of \nChinese foreign policy is articulated in the Five Principles of Peaceful \nCoexistence, enunciated by Zhou Enlai in 1954: 1) mutual respect for \nsovereignty and territorial integrity; 2) mutual non-aggression; 3) non-\ninterference in each other's internal affairs; 4) equality and mutual benefit; \nand 5) peaceful coexistence in developing diplomatic relations and \neconomic and cultural exchanges with other countries. \nSince the opening of the country under Deng Xiaoping in 1978, Chinese \nforeign policy can be more generally characterized as pragmatic. \nPragmatism and the five principles are the key to understanding China's \nresponse to the Syrian crisis and indeed its general approach to foreign \nrelations. This model excludes moral or ethical arguments from the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031587 \npractice of foreign policy, and as such is antithetical to Western ideals, \nwhich raises questions, misunderstandings, and fears among the Western \npowers as China emerges a major world power. The notion of peaceful \ndevelopment is also important, and is central to Xi Jinping's \nadministration. This concept means that China seeks peaceful relations \nwith other members of the international community to establish fruitful \neconomic relations that will serve Chinese development goals. To achieve \nthis goal, China needs a stable environment. The concept of peaceful \ndevelopment means, according to Xi Jinping, that \"China will never seek \nhegemony or expansion.\" \nAlthough Western powers may not approve of the \"Chinese Model,\" it \ndoes explain Chinese policy on the Syrian crisis. \nIt is also worth noting the influence of China's domestic situation on \nChinese policy in Syria. Beijing cannot legitimize any insurrection abroad, \nas it has to deal domestically with separatist issues (such as in Tibet, \nXinjiang, or Inner Mongolia.). To show that domestic considerations can \nlogically obliterate considerations of human rights, George Abu Ahmad, \ntaking domestic policies of Iran, Russia or China as an example, explains \nthat \"the exceptional decision to attack the population is, therefore, not \nonly a sovereign right of the twentieth-century state, but the paramount \nright that guarantees a state's integrity.\" This perspective helps us to \nunderstand the way in which China may have internalized the causes of \nthe Syrian crisis in the context of its own domestic separatist issues and \nthus cannot provide any legitimacy to an insurrection abroad. \nA final point to make is China's inability and unwillingness to take on a \n\"superpower\" role within the international community. China has no \nexperience being a political leader on the international stage, and as a \nresult has mostly abstained in the Security Council on any draft resolution \nthat did not directly affect its own domestic situation. Nor does it like to \ntake any strong stances that could lead to diplomatic clashes with a major \npower, especially the U.S. It seems improbable, given the record of \nChinese positions in the UN, that China would have opposed the Western \nresolutions on Syria without the support of Russia. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031588 \nThe South China Sea, the Senkaku/Diaoyu, and the ADIZ \nSome may argue that China is clearly adopting a more assertive policy in \nEast Asia — using the South China Sea, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands \ndispute, or the Air Defense Identification Zone as examples. However, \nthere is a difference, and this has to do with the \"sphere of influence\" of \nChina and, more specifically, with the sovereignty and integrity of \nChinese national territory (as Beijing defines it). For the CCP, the Syrian \ncrisis is a \"pure\" foreign policy issue, as the Chinese government has no \nterritorial claim in Syria or in the Middle East in general. On the other \nhand, Beijing has always considered the South China Sea and the \nSenkaku/Diaoyu islands as part of its sphere of influence and by \nvigorously defending its claims on those territorial disputes, the CCP \npurports to do nothing but protect its territorial integrity. It's arguable that \nthis concern with territory has been the very first priority of China \nthroughout its history. The debate over the East China Sea ADIZ, which \nChina established in November, can also be related to the territorial \nintegrity of the Middle Kingdom. However, Western criticisms should be \nbalanced against the knowledge that the ADIZ is an American invention \n(1950), which South Korea (1951) and Japan (1969) adopted long before \nChina did. At any rate, the South China Sea, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, \nand the ADIZ issues are domestic issues for the CCP, rather than \"pure\" \nforeign policy matters. \nThis article doesn't seek to take a normative position. Rather, the point is \nthat in the Syrian crisis China has followed a consistent foreign policy, in \nline with its principles and traditions. The outcome of this policy may not \nsatisfy many Western actors, but that is not enough to accuse China of \nfollowing a more assertive foreign policy toward Western powers and the \nU.S. in particular. Of course, the new status of China in the international \ncommunity allows it to make its voice heard, instead of the silence that \nmay have prevailed before its economic arrival. But the considerations of \nthe CCP as it formulates its foreign policy have remained the same since \nthe creation of the PRC. In the future, China is likely to be more capable \nof achieving its goals in its \"domestic\" Northeast Asian claims, but there \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031589 \nis no evidence showing that the CCP is purposefully becoming more \nassertive in its foreign policy towards the West. \nNapoleon said two-hundred years ago that, when China wakes \"she will \nshake the world.\" It may not be time to start shaking yet. \nAdrien Morin is a postgraduate student of International Affairs at Peking \nUniversity. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
