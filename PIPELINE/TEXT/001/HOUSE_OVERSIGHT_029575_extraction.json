Fingers crossed. \nI'm going upstairs to hunt for my copy of Lolita, or will get on my kindle and reread on our way to \nAustralia. I may have lent it to one of my kids. I would recommend reading My Antonia by Cather next \ntime you're on a long plane trip. The prose is gorgeous, and the book has-- come to think of it-- similar \nthemes to Lolita in that it's about a man whose whole life is stamped forever by his impression of a young \ngirl. \nThank you for this help with Serena. I'm so sorry about what happened with WA. I will keep the \"bootleg\" \nepisode and hope to release someday. It's so good, and he was so kind to read the poem with me and you \nwere so kind to make it happen. \nLisa \nElisa New \nPowell M.
