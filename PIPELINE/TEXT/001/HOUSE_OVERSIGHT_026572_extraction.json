Morgan View\nDo US elections change anything?\n� Asset allocation –– The equity market has priced out the Romney win scenario,\nbut from these levels, our economic and market outlook and risks are\nunchanged. These keep us medium-term overweight equities and credit, despite\nthe likely volatility as the fiscal cliff is negotiated. Within equities, we stay\nunderweight the US, and move most of the overweight into EM Asia. We have\nmoved some of our credit overweight from the US to Europe.\n� Economics –– The data flows continue to confirm that June/July was likely the\nbottom in global activity growth, and that we are gently lifting from those\nlevels, even as it will take well into next year before growth returns to trend.\n� Fixed Income –– Look for yields to head higher, but focus more risk on spread\ncompression trades.\n� Equities –– We focus our overweights on EM Asia, Cyclical stocks and US\nHome builders.\n� Credit –– We see the current dip as an opportunity to add risk.\n� Currencies –– Be long the dollar during the fiscal cliff negotiations.\n� Commodities –– A further set of better Chinese economic data keeps us long\nbase metals.\n� Equity markets are taking the Obama victory quite badly, with US stocks\ndown some 4% on Wednesday and Thursday. This has pushed up global bond\nmarkets, and credit spreads are wider, but commodities are largely ignoring this\nturmoil. We don’t think an Obama victory truly changes the economic outlook,\nor risks, but it does eliminate the Romney hope that appeared to have been in\nmarket pricing.\n� By definition, the Romney scenario is now priced out of the market. The US\nelections confirm the status quo in Washington, and to us, they do so also for\nthe broad economic and market outlook, from current levels. Hence, we do not\nsee much reason to change our investment allocations, and remain medium-term\noverweight both credit and equities against cash, government debt, and\ncommodities. We do so on the basis of value – still high risk premia – fading\nrisks on fiscal policy in the US into next year; an expected rebound in global\ngrowth; and super easy monetary policy, with more QE coming if growth were\nto disappoint.\n� In recent weeks, we have switched out of our long-standing US risk overweight,\ninto an underweight, on the argument that the US had the most committed\ncentral banker, its growth has been least disappointing, and its fiscal risks were\nfurther into the future. This relative risk has changed, with Chinese economic\ndata confirming that its economy is rebounding, while the ECB now creating a\nperiod a relative financial “peace”. The US, in contrast, is at the start of intense\nnegotiations on how to avoid a fiscal-cliff induced recession next year. Neither\nside of the aisle has an interest in being blamed for a recession. But markets will\nstill be buffeted by a steady news flow on wide gaps between each side’s\nposition.\nSee page 7 for analyst certification and important disclosures.\nGlobal Asset Allocation\nJan Loeys AC\n(1-212) 834-5874\njan.loeys@jpmorgan.com\nJPMorgan Chase Bank NA\nJohn Normand\n(44-20) 7134-1816\njohn.normand@jpmorgan.com\nJ.P.

Morgan View\n09 November 2012\n�\n�\nAs a result, we stay underweight US equities and have moved risk from our\nUS credit longs into Europe. Our initial US equity underweight was against\nEurope and EM Asia. Our recent downgrade of Q1 growth in the Euro area\nand better activity data in China made us move the lion’s share of the\noverweight versus the US into EM Asia (see Wednesday’s Global Market\nOutlook and Strategy).\nChinese activity data continue to surprise on the upside. October data for\nIP, retail sales and fixed investment each came above our expectations. This\ncreates upside risk, but no change yet, to our forecasts which already assume a\ngentle rise in quarterly growth rates from under 7% early this year to just\nabove 8% in Q1. Better data reduce the need for renewed fiscal and monetary\nstimulus. The 18th Party Congress started yesterday, will last a week, and will\nbe followed by the announcement of the next leadership. More important for\nthe economic outlook will be the Annual Central Economic Working\nConference that will be held in December. We expect it to support continued\nmoderate fiscal policy, a neutral monetary policy, and further economic\nrebalancing towards domestic consumption. It may also lower the 2013\ngrowth target to 7%. For more details, see Haibin Zhu in today’s GDW.\nFixed Income\n�\n�\n�\n�\nBonds rallied strongly, in the slipstream of the tumbling equity market.\nPresident Obama’s re-election perhaps also diminishes expectations of a\nchange in course at the Fed.\nThe ECB and the Bank of England stood pat at their policy meetings this\nweek, but the latter delivered a curveball today, announcing that its net\ncoupon income from QE would be transferred to the UK Treasury from next\nyear on. The near-term effect is a slight monetary easing, as the money will\nbe used to reduce the amount of gilts in issue, similar to QE itself.\nBeyond that, this is another small step towards perceptions that monetary\npolicy is no longer independent from fiscal policy, like the Bank of Japan’s\njoint statement with two government ministers last month. Nobody knows the\ntipping point at which these perceptions feed into much higher inflation\nexpectations, just that we’ll know it when we see it.\nCore euro bond yields are towards the low end of the range, and we expect\nthem to head higher. But we focus more risk on spread compression trades,\nvia overweights in Euro area peripherals, US MBS, and EM local bonds vs\nDM.\nEquities\n�\n�\n�\nEquity markets fell sharply post US elections, but we are not changing our\nstrategy.\nFrom a month ago, we avoided directional longs in our GMOS model equity\nportfolio due to elevated positions by spec investors (see Charts A10 and A12\nin today’s Flows & Liquidity). We preferred to focus instead on regional and\nsectoral trades. We stay with the same strategy focusing our\nrecommendations on EM Asia across regions, and Cyclical stocks and US\nHome builders across sectors.\nThe rebound in the October global manufacturing PMI is what keeps us long\nCyclical vs. Defensive equity sectors.

Morgan View\n09 November 2012\nnecessarily. Last summer, as equity markets rebounded in June and July,\nCyclical sectors actually underperformed. The thin grey line in the top chart\nshows that Cyclical sectors have recaptured only a quarter of the\nunderperformance seen between March and August and thus provide a better\nentry point. Position indicators suggest that investors are underweight\nCyclicals and overweight Defensives which is turn means that Defensive\nsectors are more vulnerable to position unwinding.\n�\nWe introduced an underweight in US equities in mid October to position for\nthe US fiscal cliff risk. Obama’s win makes it more likely that this risk will\nintensify into year-end. Across regions we favor EM Asia and Europe vs. the\nUS. While the US is facing fiscal cliff risks, Asian equities are benefiting\nfrom concrete signs that economic activity is rebounding in China. European\nequities are benefiting from greater improvement in financial conditions,\nalthough they are more vulnerable to noise around the Greek and Spanish\nissues.\nCredit\n�\n�\n�\nUS credit spreads edged wider in response to the fall in equity markets\nfollowing the US elections. US HG widened 7bp to 160bp, undoing around\nhalf of October’s peak-to-trough moves. Similar moves registered in other\nUSD credit markets. At 107bp, the CDX.IG is now back to early-August\nlevels, even as the CDS-Bond basis moved back into negative territory with\ncorporate bond spreads again moving above CDS.\nCredit spreads may be repricing the risk of a fiscal-cliff induced recession in\n2013. For context, we expect the eventual outcome of the negotiations to lead\nto about 2% of GDP in fiscal contraction, not enough to tip the economy back\ninto recession in itself, and considerably lower than the 4% drag under the full\nenactment of all revenue raising measures and spending cuts currently set to\nbecome law on Jan 1.\nFrom our point of view, the elections confirm the status quo both in\nWashington and in market conditions – i.e. we should expect more of the\nsame and it has been a great year for credit. Therefore, we see the current\ndip as an opportunity to add risk, and expect spreads to continue to tighten\ninto year end, albeit at a slower rate than in recent months. We stay down in\nquality and outline in GMOS this week some relative value arguments for\nEuro HY vs US HY. On that front, European credit shrugged off the election\noutcome, tightening marginally in the HG space and widening very slightly in\nthe HY space.\nForeign Exchange\n�\n�\nThe post-US election drama is unfolding as expected. Four more years with\nthe same cast is delivering a higher USD versus most currencies but JPY due\nto deleveraging ahead of the fiscal cliff, and lower USD/CNY forwards due to\navoidance of US-China trade conflict (see An FX guide to America’s toss-up\nelection, FX Markets Weekly, Nov 2). The only surprise has been that FX\nvolatility remains so subdued (VXY unchanged at 7.4%) in a week when the\ntrade-weighted dollar and equity volatility have rallied. Chalk it up to\npositioning, as most indicators suggest that institutions investors entered the\nUS polls with aggregate USD positions close to flat.\nNow, sausage-making season begins. US recession is guaranteed if the fiscal\ncliff is enacted on schedule, and neither Congress nor the President welcomes\nMore details in ...\nUS Credit Markets Outlook and Strategy, Eric Beinstein\net al.\nHigh Yield Credit Markets Weekly, Peter Acciavatti et al.\nEuropean Credit Outlook & Strategy, Steven Dulake et\nal.\nEmerging Markets Cross Product Strategy Weekly, Eric\nBeinstein et al.\n3\nJan Loeys\n(1-212) 834-5874\njan.loeys@jpmorgan.com\nGlobal Asset Allocation\nThe J.P. Morgan View\n09 November 2012\n�\n�\nthat outcome. But avoiding the worst case requires a short-term bargain plus a\nlong-term compromise on a scale not seen in Washington since the Clinton-\nCongressional budget showdown of 1995/96. As with sausage making, this\nprocess won’t be pleasant to watch. It would be easier to return in several\nweeks when the final product is ready, but for those who cannot avoid, ignore\nthe likely volatility, and add to defensive trades.\nWashington needs at least a month to broker deferral of a decent part of the\nfiscal cliff before it can assume the monumental task of comprehensive fiscal\nreform next year, and the currencies most vulnerable to an impasse are\nexpensive. If no grand bargain is reached before the end of the year, full\nimplementation of the cliff implies enough fiscal tightening to drive the dollar\nup 3%-5% versus commodity currencies, given typical patterns during global\ngrowth shocks. Even if these tax increases are reversed later in the year, the\nfirst response would be a higher USD versus all currencies but the yen, given\nhow long that investors are of cyclical currencies and how short they are the\nyen.\nStay short USD/JPY and buy USD vs high-beta (AUD, NZD, SEK and GBP)\nin cash and options for a move of a few percent in coming weeks. In options,\nsell a 1-mo NZD/USD call (0.8250 strike, 0.83 RKI), buy a bearish 2-mo\nAUD/USD seagull (buy 1.03-1.01 put spread, sell 1.05 call) and buy a bearish\n2-mo GBP/USD seagull (buy 1.57-1.55 put spread, sell 1.6250 call). Buy\nUSD/SEK in cash.\nCommodities\n�\n�\n�\nCommodities are up some 1% this week, led by precious metals, which\nrallied almost 4%. The strong gains in gold are probably due to the US\nelection result as Obama’s victory means no change to Fed policy and so\ncontinued QE and negative real yields. Gold also tends to gain when there is\nhigh fiscal uncertainty, just as it did last year during the acrimonious debt\nceiling debate which cost the US its AAA rating. We stay long gold.\nChinese economic data came out stronger than expected this week, providing\nsupport for our view that Chinese economic growth has bottomed and will\nrebound through next year. China’s slowing activity growth has been a major\ndrag on commodities over the last few years and the improving economy is\nwhat makes us long base metals.\nThe expected rebound in Chinese growth does not imply that we will go back\nto the double-digit growth rates that we saw before the crisis, and immediately\nafter. The periods when China’s economy grew at a pace above 8% coincided\nwith very strong price gains on commodities, as it boosted global demand.\nChina’s leadership is in the process of reorienting its economy towards\ndomestic consumption and to reduce reliance on exports and capital\ninvestments. As a result, Chinese growth will likely settle in a 7%-8% range\nover the medium term, a growth pace that in the past has not put upwards\npressure on commodity prices.\nFX weekly change in USD\n1.0%\n0.5%\n0.0%\n-0.5%\n-1.0%\nUSD\nTWI\nSource: J.P.
