Plaintiffs Are Entitled to Jurisdictional\nDiscovery as to Privatbank’s\nInvesting Activities in the United\nStates\n[37] Plaintiffs point out that Privatbank’s\nwebsite and its 2001 Annual Report\nstate that Privatbank engages in transactions\ninvolving securities issued in the\nUnited States. (2001 Annual Report at 3,\nattached to Affidavit of Frances E. Bivens\nat Exhibit B). There is no allegation that\ntransactions are related to the claims asserted\nhere. Accordingly, they are only\nrelevant to this Court’s determination of\nwhether the exercise of general jurisdiction\nover Privatbank is warranted pursuant\nto Rule 4(k)(2) for having such ‘‘continuous\nand systematic general business\ncontacts’’ with the United States. See\nAerogroup Int’l, Inc., 956 F.Supp. at 439.\nBecause plaintiffs have identified a genuine\nissue of jurisdictional fact, the question\nof general jurisdiction cannot be resolved\non the pleadings and affidavits\nalone. Thus, plaintiffs are entitled to jurisdictional\ndiscovery regarding the extent\nof defendant Privatbank’s general business\ncontacts with the United States in the\nyears 1992—1998, a period that includes\nthe relevant period in this action and five\npreceding years. See In re Magnetic Audiotape\nAntitrust Litig., 334 F.3d at 207–\n08; see also, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 84\nF.3d at 569–70 (holding that the time period\nrelevant for determining extent of a\ndefendant’s contacts for general jurisdiction\npurpose should include a number of\nyears prior to the events giving rise to the\nclaims asserted).\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, the\nSovereign defendants’ motion to dismiss is\ngranted in part and denied in part. Plaintiffs’\nclaims alleging takings in violation of\ninternational law, promissory estoppel, equitable\nestoppel, and unjust enrichment—\ncounts seven, nine, and ten in the complaint—are\nhereby dismissed as against\nthe Sovereign defendants. In addition, the\nmotion of individual defendants Horath\nand Buchmann to dismiss the complaint\nfor lack of personal jurisdiction is granted\nand all claims asserted against those defendants\nare hereby dismissed.\nBecause this Court finds that an issue of\njurisdictional fact exists as to the existence\nof general jurisdiction pursuant to Rule\n4(k)(2) as to corporate defendant Privatbank,\nits motion to dismiss is denied without\nprejudice to its renewal pending conclusion\nof jurisdictional discovery on that\nissue.\n,\nIn re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON\nSEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nBurnett v.

A ‘‘foreign state’’ is\nstatutorily defined:\n(a) A ‘‘foreign state’’ TTT includes a political\nsubdivision of a foreign state or an\nagency or instrumentality of a foreign\nstate as defined in subsection (b).\n(b) An ‘‘agency or instrumentality of a\nforeign state’’ means any entity -\n(1) which is a separate legal person,\ncorporate or otherwise, and\n(2) which is an organ of a foreign\nstate or political subdivision thereof,\nor a majority of whose shares or other\nownership interest is owned by a foreign\nstate or political subdivision\nthereof, and\n(3) which is neither a citizen of a\nState of the United States TTT nor\ncreated under the laws of any third\ncountry.\n28 U.S.C. § 1603. There is no dispute\nthat the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a\nforeign state. The status of each of the\nPrinces and NCB are discussed below.\n1. Prince Sultan and Prince Turki\nSeveral courts have recognized that\n‘‘[i]mmunity under the FSIA extends also\nto agents of a foreign state acting in their\nofficial capacities [since] ‘[i]t is generally\nrecognized that a suit against an individual\nacting in his official capacity is the practical\nequivalent of a suit against the sovereign\ndirectly.’ ’’ 23 Bryks v. Canadian\nBroad. Corp., 906 F.Supp. 204, 210\n(S.D.N.Y.1995) (quoting Chuidian v. Philippine\nNat’l Bank, 912 F.2d 1095, 1101\n(9th Cir.1990) (‘‘Nowhere in the text or\nlegislative history does Congress state that\nindividuals are not encompassed within 28\nU.S.C. § 1603(b).’’)); see also Velasco v.\nGov’t of Indonesia, 370 F.3d 392, 398–99\n(4th Cir.2004) (collecting cases extending\n23. The FSIA is silent on the subject. Neither\nthe Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit\nFSIA immunity to individuals sued in their\nofficial capacities); Byrd v. Corporacion\nForestal y Industrial de Olancho S.A., 182\nF.3d 380, 388 (5th Cir.1999) (acknowledging\nthe FSIA protects individuals to\nthe extent they act within their official\nduties); El–Fadl v. Cent. Bank of Jordan,\n75 F.3d 668, 671 (D.C.Cir.1996) (dismissing\nclaims against government officials since\nthey were sued in their official capacities);\nLeutwyler, 184 F.Supp.2d at 286–87 (‘‘[I]t\nhas been generally recognized that individuals\nemployed by a foreign state’s agencies\nor instrumentalities are deemed ‘foreign\nstates’ when they are sued for actions undertaken\nwithin the scope of their official\ncapacities.’’) (citing Bryks, 906 F.Supp. at\n210); Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran,\n999 F.Supp. 1, 11 n. 3 (D.D.C.1998) (noting\nfavorable practice of applying FSIA to individuals).\nThus, this Court finds that immunity\nmay be available to Prince Sultan,\nas the third-highest ranking member of\nthe Saudi government, and to Prince\nTurki, as the Director of Saudi Arabia’s\nDepartment of General Intelligence, to the\nextent their alleged actions were performed\nin their official capacities.\n[10] The Federal Plaintiffs argue that\nthe FSIA cannot apply to Prince Turki\nbecause, as of September 10, 2003 when\nthe complaint was filed, Prince Turki was\nthe Saudi ambassador to the United Kingdom,\na position the Federal Plaintiffs allege\nis not entitled to immunity under the\nFSIA. In support of this argument, the\nFederal Plaintiffs cite Dole Food Co. v.\nPatrickson, 538 U.S. 468, 480, 123 S.Ct.\n1655, 155 L.Ed.2d 643 (2003), in which the\nSupreme Court held that instrumentality\nstatus is determined at the time of the\nfiling of the complaint.\nhas specifically addressed the issue.\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n789\n24. After the parties submitted their briefs and\nargued the FSIA issue, the Ashton Plaintiffs\nfiled supplemental affidavits, without leave of\nthe Court, to contest, for the first time, the\ntiming of the PIF’s majority ownership. See\n03 MD 1570 Docket # 455. The parties agree\nthat the PIF bought 50% of NCB shares in\nMay 1999. See John Fawcett Sept. 23, 2004\nSupplemental Affidavit at Ex. 1 (‘‘Fawcett\nSupp. Aff.’’). Later in 1999, the PIF sold 10%\nof its shares to the General Organization for\n[11] The Court disagrees with this reliance\non Dole Food. The Supreme Court\nresolved two questions in Dole Food. ‘‘The\nfirst [was] whether a corporate subsidiary\ncan claim instrumentality status where the\nforeign state does not own a majority of its\nshares but does own a majority of the\nshares of a corporate parent one or more\ntiers above the subsidiary. The second\nquestion [was] whether a corporation’s instrumentality\nstatus is defined as of the\ntime an alleged tort or other actionable\nwrong occurred or, on the other hand, at\nthe time the suit is filed.’’ Id. at 471, 123\nS.Ct. 1655. The Supreme Court held that\na foreign state’s ownership of an entity\nmust be direct for the entity to be considered\nan instrumentality. Id. at 474, 123\nS.Ct. 1655. The Supreme Court also ruled\nthat ownership must be determined as of\nthe date on which the complaint was filed.\nId. at 480, 123 S.Ct. 1655. Neither of\nthese points of law speaks, however, to the\ncircumstances under which an individual is\ncovered by the FSIA. Indeed, numerous\nother courts that have addressed this issue\nhave held that the relevant inquiry for\nindividuals is simply whether the acts in\nquestion were undertaken at a time when\nthe individual was acting in an official capacity.\nSee, e.g., Velasco, 370 F.3d at 398–\n99; Byrd, 182 F.3d at 388; Bryks, 906\nF.Supp. at 210. This Court considers that\nprecedent to be more consistent with the\nFSIA and unaltered by the decision in\nDole Food. Thus, it deems Prince Turki\nthe equivalent of the foreign state inasmuch\nas the complaints allege actions taken\nin his official capacity as the head of the\nDGI. Accordingly, both Prince Sultan and\nPrince Turki are immune from suit for\ntheir official acts unless an exception under\nthe FSIA applies.\n2. National Commercial Bank\nNCB submits that it is an instrumentality\nof the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and\ntherefore immune from suit. See Decl. of\nNizar Bin Obaid Madani, Assistant Minister\nof Foreign Affairs of Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia ¶ 2, at Berger Decl. Ex. 7 (‘‘It is\nthe position of the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs that NCB is a government instrumentality\nof the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.’’).\nTo enjoy immunity from suit under\nthe FSIA, NCB must demonstrate that it\nis an agency or instrumentality, or a political\nsubdivision of the Kingdom. 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1603(a). As explained above, the FSIA\ndefines an ‘‘agency or instrumentality’’ as\n(1) ‘‘a separate legal person, TTT(2) which\nis an organ of a foreign state or political\nsubdivision thereof, or a majority of whose\nshares or other ownership interest is\nowned by a foreign state or political subdivision\nthereof,’’ and (3) a non-U.S. citizen.\n28 U.S.C. § 1603(b). Accordingly, NCB\nclaims that (1) it is a separate legal person,\n(2) at the time the suit was filed a majority\nof its shares were owned by an administrative\nunit of the Saudi Ministry of Finance,\nthe Public Investment Fund (‘‘PIF’’), 24 and\n(3) it is not a citizen of the United States\nSocial Insurance. Fawcett Supp. Aff. at Ex.\n2. Late in 2002 the PIF agreed to buy 30% of\nthe remaining shares from the bin Mahfouz\nfamily, but Plaintiffs claim the purchase was\nnot completed until January 2003, after the\nlawsuit was filed on September 4, 2002. See\nFawcett Supp. Aff. at Ex. 3 & 4 (news accounts\nof sale). For the reasons that will be\nexplained below, the Court finds it unnecessary\nto resolve this dispute at this time.\n790 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nor created under the laws of a third country.\n[12] In Dole Food, the Supreme Court\nheld ‘‘that only direct ownership of a majority\nof shares by the foreign state satisfies\nthe statutory requirement’’ outlined in\n§ 1603(b). 538 U.S. at 474, 123 S.Ct. 1655.\nAccordingly, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s\nownership of NCB must be direct for\nNCB to enjoy immunity under the FSIA.\nThat is, NCB will not be deemed an instrumentality\nof the Kingdom if the PIF, its\nmajority owner, is determined to be an\nagency, instrumentality, or organ of the\nKingdom. See § 1603(b)(2) (stating agency\nor instrumentality is entity whose majority\nownership interest is held by either\nthe foreign state or a political subdivision\nthereof); Filler v. Hanvit Bank, 378 F.3d\n213 (2d Cir.2004) (holding an organ’s ownership\nof two banks did not, in turn, make\nthe banks organs or instrumentalities of\nforeign state); see also In re Ski Train\nFire in Kaprun, Austria, 198 F.Supp.2d\n420, 426 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (holding ski resort\nowner, which was owned in part by instrumentality\nof Austrian government, was not\ninstrumentality because it was not owned\ndirectly by the state or a subdivision thereof);\nHyatt Corp. v. Stanton, 945 F.Supp.\n675, 688 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (concluding ‘‘that\ncorporations a majority of whose shares\nare owned by agencies or instrumentalities\nof foreign states are not themselves agencies\nor instrumentalities’’). Thus, NCB\nmust demonstrate that the PIF is the\nequivalent of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nor a political subdivision thereof.\nThe PIF was established by Royal Decree\nwith the sole function of ‘‘financing\nTTT investments in productive projects of\na commercial nature whether they belong\nto the Government or the industrial lending\ninstitutions connected to it or to its\npublic corporations and whether these\nprojects are undertaken independently or\nin partnership between these administrative\nparties and private institutions.’’ PIF\nCharter ¶ 2, at Berger Aff.

Id. ¶ 5; Supplemental Al–Wohaibi\nAff. ¶¶ 8–10 (hereinafter ‘‘Supp. Al–Wohaibi\nAff.’’).\na. Status of the PIF\nIn Filler v. Hanvit Bank, a case with\nfacts very similar to those presented here,\nthe Second Circuit reiterated Dole Food ’s\nrequirement of direct ownership for instrumentality\nstatus. Two defendants were\ncommercial banks majority-owned by the\nKorean Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(‘‘KDIC’’), a ‘‘governmental institution’’\nrun by the Korean Ministry of Finance\nand the Economy of the Republic of Korea.\nFiller, 378 F.3d at 215–16. In determining\nif KDIC was an organ of Korea,\nthe court considered several factors:\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n791\n(1) whether the foreign state created\nthe entity for a national purpose; (2)\nwhether the foreign state actively supervises\nthe entity; (3) whether the foreign\nstate requires the hiring of public employees\nand pays their salaries; (4)\nwhether the entity holds exclusive rights\nto some right in the [foreign] country;\nand (5) how the entity is treated under\nforeign state law.\nId. at 217 (citing Kelly v. Syria Shell\nPetroleum Dev. B.V., 213 F.3d 841, 846–47\n(5th Cir.2000) (alteration in original)).\nThe Second Circuit held that the KDIC\nwas an organ of Korea because it was\nformed by statute and presidential decree;\nit performs the governmental functions of\nprotecting depositors and promoting financial\nstability; its directors are appointed\nby the Ministry of Finance and Economy;\nits president is appointed by the President\nof the Republic of Korea; and many of its\noperations are overseen by the Ministry of\nFinance and Economy. Id.\nThe banks argued that once the court\ndetermined KDIC was an organ of the\nforeign state, the banks automatically became\ninstrumentalities or agencies of the\nstate because KDIC owned a majority of\ntheir stock. Id. The Second Circuit rejected\nthis argument, finding such a holding\nwould ‘‘permit an infinite number of subsidiaries\nto enjoy sovereign immunity, TTT\nwould be incompatible with the purpose of\nthe FSIA, which is to grant governmental,\nnot private corporate immunity, and TTT\nwould reflect infidelity to the Supreme\nCourt’s reasoning in Dole Food.’’ Id. at\n218. Accordingly, it reiterated that ‘‘ ‘a\nsubsidiary of an instrumentality is not itself\nentitled to instrumentality status’ TTT\nand that ‘only direct ownership of a majority\nof shares by the foreign state satisfies\nthe statutory requirement.’ ’’ Id. (quoting\nDole Food, 538 U.S. at 473–74, 123 S.Ct.\n1655).\nThe Second Circuit determined the\nKDIC was an organ of Korea by considering\nwhether it was created and supervised\nby a foreign state and whether public employees\nwere performing public functions.\nId. at 217. Under its reasoning, it would\nappear the PIF is also an organ. It was\ncreated by royal decree, it is supervised by\nthe Kingdom’s Council of Ministers and\nstaffed with government employees. See\nPIF Charter.\nYet, under the ‘‘legal characteristics’’\ntest, the PIF could qualify as a political\nsubdivision. See Hyatt, 945 F.Supp. at\n680. In Hyatt, a court in this district\nreasoned that a statutory requirement of\nan agency or instrumentality, as opposed\nto a political subdivision, is that it is a\n‘‘separate legal person TTT that can function\nindependent of the state.’’ Id. at 684.\nIf an entity could sue and be sued, own\nproperty, and contract in its own name, it\nwould be considered an agency or instrumentality\nand not a political subdivision.\nId. at 685. NCB submits the PIF sues\nand is sued as, and generally holds property\non behalf of, the Ministry of Finance.\nAl–Wohaibi Aff. ¶¶ 9, 12.\nNCB argues the Court should employ\nthe ‘‘core functions’’ test outlined in Transaero,\nInc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana,\n30 F.3d 148 (D.C.Cir.1994), to find that the\nPIF is the equivalent of the Kingdom.\nUnder this test, if the entity’s core functions\nare governmental, it is considered\nthe state itself. Id. at 153. If its functions\nare commercial in nature, it is considered\nan instrumentality. Id. This Court is governed\nby Second Circuit precedent and\nfinds Filler and Hyatt to be controlling.\nEven if it were to adopt Transaero, however,\nthe Court finds on the record before it\nthat the PIF’s emphasis on commercial\nprojects precludes a finding that its core\nfunctions are governmental in nature. See\nPIF Charter ¶ 2 (noting the PIF’s primary\n792 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nfunction of ‘‘financing TTT investments in\nproductive projects of a commercial nature’’).\nNCB also urges that O’Connell Machinery\nCo. v. M.V. ‘‘Americana,’’ 734 F.2d 115\n(2d Cir.1984), mandates the finding that\nthe PIF is a political subdivision of the\nKingdom. In O’Connell, the Second Circuit\nreasoned that the legislative history of\nthe FSIA indicated that ‘‘political subdivisions’’\nwere intended to include ‘‘all governmental\nunits beneath the central government.’’\nId. (quoting H.R.Rep. No.\n1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 15, reprinted in,\n1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6613). Given the\nPIF’s position under the Ministry of Finance,\nO’Connell could lead to the conclusion\nthat the PIF is a political subdivision\nof the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Id.; but\nsee In re Ski Train Fire, 198 F.Supp.2d at\n425 n. 9 (distinguishing O’Connell on\ngrounds that the court based its holding on\na finding that the Italian government double-tiered\nits administrative agencies);\nHyatt, 945 F.Supp. at 683–84 (finding definition\nof ‘‘political subdivision’’ in O’Connell\ntoo broad and suggesting the case\nshould be limited to its facts and not applied\nwidely). In the twenty years since\nO’Connell was decided, however, courts\nhave been inclined to limit the FSIA’s\ngrant of immunity. See, e.g., Dole Food,\n538 U.S. at 473–74, 123 S.Ct. 1655; Filler,\n378 F.3d at 218. Accordingly, the Court\nwill not rely on O’Connell here.\nb. Limited Jurisdictional Discovery\nis Warranted\n[13] The Court finds that resolution of\nthe PIF’s and thereby NCB’s status is not\ndeterminable on the current record and,\ntherefore, limited jurisdictional discovery\nis warranted. As explained above, the\nPIF could qualify either as an organ or\npolitical subdivision of the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia. Additionally, the affidavits on\nwhich the parties ask the Court to rely\nhave not been subjected to cross examination\nand are rather self-serving. The parties\nshould have the opportunity to take\ndiscovery of the jurisdictionally relevant\nfacts. First City, 150 F.3d at 177; see also\nIn re Magnetic Audiotape Antitrust Litig.,\n334 F.3d 204, 208 (2d Cir.2003) (instructing\ndistrict court to permit discovery before\ngranting motion to dismiss based on factsensitive,\nmulti-factor test). Accordingly,\nNCB’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction based on the FSIA\nis denied without prejudice. Limited jurisdictional\ndiscovery will be permitted to\nexplore PIF’s function, organizational\nstructure, and place within the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia.\nD. Application of FSIA Exceptions\nto the Princes and Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia\nThree exceptions to foreign sovereign\nimmunity are implicated in these motions—the\ncommercial activities exception,\n28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2), the state sponsor of\nterrorism exception, 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(7), and the torts exception, 28\nU.S.C. § 1605(a)(5).\n1. Commercial Activities Exception\n[14] Section 1605(a)(2) states:\nA foreign state shall not be immune TTT\nin any case TTT in which the action is\nbased TTT upon an act performed in the\nUnited States in connection with a commercial\nactivity of the foreign state elsewhere;\nor upon an act outside the territory\nof the United States in connection\nwith a commercial activity of the foreign\nstate elsewhere and that act causes a\ndirect effect in the United States.\n28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2). The statute defines\n‘‘commercial activity’’ as ‘‘either a\nregular course of commercial conduct or a\nparticular commercial transaction or act.\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n793\nThe commercial character of an activity\nshall be determined by reference to the\nnature of the course of conduct or particular\ntransaction or act, rather than by reference\nto its purpose.’’ 28 U.S.C. § 1603(d).\nThe Supreme Court has explained, ‘‘when\na foreign government acts, not as a regulator\nof the market, but in the manner of a\nprivate player within it, the foreign sovereign’s\nactions are ‘commercial’ within the\nmeaning of the FSIA.’’ Weltover, 504 U.S.\nat 614, 112 S.Ct. 2160. Courts must inquire\nwhether the foreign state’s actions\n‘‘are the type of actions by which a private\nparty engages in trade and traffic or commerce.’’\nId. (internal citations omitted).\n[15] Judge Robertson determined that\nthe commercial activity exception did not\napply to the Burnett Plaintiffs’ claims\nagainst Prince Sultan and Prince Turki\nbecause ‘‘the act of contributing to a foundation\nis not within our ordinary understanding\nof ‘trade and traffic or commerce’\nnor, apparently was it within the contemplation\nof TTT Congress.’’ Burnett II, 292\nF.Supp.2d at 18 (citing H.R.Rep. No. 94–\n1487, at 16, reprinted in 1976\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 6615). Thus, the consolidated\nPlaintiffs do not assert that the commercial\nactivities exception is applicable to\nany of the Defendants raising FSIA defenses\nhere. This Court adopts Judge\nRobertson’s reasoning. To the extent any\nPlaintiffs’ claims are based on a Defendant’s\ncontributions to charities, those acts\ncannot be considered commercial.\n[16, 17] The Federal Plaintiffs allege\nthat the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Prince\nSultan, and Prince Turki financed terrorism\nby contributing to or supporting charities\nknown to support terrorist activities.\nIn these Plaintiffs’ view, this is essentially\nmoney laundering and, therefore, a commercial\nactivity. See, e.g., Federal Plaintiffs’\nOpp. to Motion to Dismiss of Prince\nSultan at 18 (citing U.S. v. Goodwin, 141\nF.3d 394, 399 (2d Cir.1997)). The Second\nCircuit noted in Goodwin that ‘‘[m]oney\nlaundering is a quintessential economic activity,’’\n141 F.3d at 399, but that statement\nhas no bearing here. In Goodwin the\ncourt was not deciding whether money\nlaundering is a commercial activity for\npurposes of the FSIA. Id. (analyzing constitutionality\nof criminal money laundering\nstatute). The Second Circuit has made\nvery clear that, for purposes of the FSIA,\na commercial activity must be one in which\na private person can engage lawfully.\nLetelier v. Republic of Chile, 748 F.2d 790,\n797–98 (2d Cir.1984); see also Saudi Arabia\nv. Nelson, 507 U.S. 349, 360–62, 113\nS.Ct. 1471, 123 L.Ed.2d 47 (1993) (holding\ndetaining and torturing plaintiff is not\ncommercial activity since it ‘‘is not the sort\nof action by which private parties can engage\nin commerce’’). Since money laundering\nis an illegal activity, see 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1956 (criminalizing money laundering), it\ncannot be the basis for applicability of the\ncommercial activities exception. See Letelier,\n748 F.2d at 798 (holding alleged participation\nin an assassination is not a lawful\nactivity and therefore not a commercial\nactivity for purposes of the FSIA). Accordingly,\nthe Court finds that the commercial\nactivities exception outlined in\n§ 1605(a)(2) is inapplicable to the allegations\ncontained in the Federal complaint\nagainst the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\nPrince Sultan, and Prince Turki.\n2. State Sponsor of Terrorism\n[18] Subsection (a)(7) lifts immunity in\ncases:\nin which money damages are sought\nagainst a foreign state for personal injury\nor death that was caused by an act of\ntorture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft\nsabotage, hostage taking, or the provision\nof material support or resources\nTTT for such an act TTT except that the\n794 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\ncourt shall decline to hear a claim under\nthis paragraph\n(A) if the foreign state was not designated\nas a state sponsor of terrorism\nTTTT\n28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(7) (emphasis added).\nThe parties agree that the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia has not been designated a\nstate sponsor of terrorism. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(7)(A) (explaining there is no jurisdiction\nif ‘‘the foreign state was not\ndesignated as a state sponsor of terrorism\nunder TTT the Export Administration Act\nof 1979 TTT or TTT the Foreign Assistance\nAct of 1961’’). Thus, this exception does\nnot provide an exception to immunity for\nany of the Defendants raising the FSIA\ndefense here.\n3. Torts Exception\nIn relevant part, the torts exception deprives\na foreign sovereign of immunity in\nactions:\nin which money damages are sought\nagainst a foreign state for personal injury\nor death, or damage to or loss of\nproperty, occurring in the United States\nand caused by the tortious act or omission\nof that foreign state or of any official\nor employee of that foreign state\nwhile acting within the scope of his office\nor employment; except this [exception]\nshall not apply to -\n(A) any claim based upon the exercise\nor performance or the failure to exercise\nor perform a discretionary function\nregardless of whether the discretion\nbe abused.\n28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5). Second Circuit\nlaw instructs that district courts must determine\nwhether the defendant’s alleged\nacts were tortious under the laws of New\nYork and, if so, whether the defendant’s\nacts were discretionary. Robinson, 269\nF.3d at 142 (‘‘If those activities could not\nrender the Malaysian government liable\nfor a tort under New York law, then it\nremained immune under § 1605(a)(5).’’).\nIn the event that the act is tortious and\nthe acts were not discretionary, the alleged\ntortfeasor is subject to suit under the\nFSIA.\n[19] The FSIA’s discretionary function\nexception replicates the discretionary function\nexception found in the Federal Tort\nClaims Act. See 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).\nCourts have found both exceptions are ‘‘intended\nto preserve immunity for ‘decisions\ngrounded in social, economic, and political\npolicy.’ ’’ Marchisella v. Gov’t of Japan,\nNo. 02 Civ. 10023(DC), 2004 WL 307248, at\n*2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 2004) (citing United\nStates v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea\nRio Grandense (Varig Airlines), 467 U.S.\n797, 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660\n(1984) (interpreting FTCA)). Generally,\nacts are discretionary if they are performed\nat the planning level of government,\nas opposed to the operational level.\nKline v. Kaneko, 685 F.Supp. 386, 392\n(S.D.N.Y.1988) (finding decision to expel\nplaintiff from Mexico was product of enforcement\nof immigration laws and therefore\na discretionary function); Marchisella,\n2004 WL 307248, at *2 (finding decision\nregarding placement of a water hose on a\nship was an operational function and therefore\nnot discretionary and not protected by\nthe FSIA); Napolitano v. Tishman\nConstr. Corp., No. 96 Civ. 4402(SJ), 1998\nWL 102789, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 1998)\n(finding purchasing consulate buildings\nand hiring contractor to renovate is a planning\nfunction and therefore discretionary).\nDefendants argue that the Court should\nnot even consider the torts exception for\ntwo reasons. First, they claim that for\nthis exception to apply, the entire tort\nmust have occurred in the United States,\nwhich Defendants argue is not the case\nhere. Second, Defendants claim that\nPlaintiffs impermissibly seek to contort a\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n795\n§ 1605(a)(7) state sponsor of terrorism\nclaim into a § 1605(a)(5) tort claim.\nWith respect to Prince Sultan’s and\nPrince Turki’s arguments that the entire\ntort, meaning both the tortious conduct\nand the injury, must occur in the United\nStates, Judge Robertson disagreed and\nstated the FSIA ‘‘preserves immunity for\ntort claims unless injury or death occurs in\nthe United States.’’ Burnett II, 292\nF.Supp.2d at 19 n. 4 (quoting Tel–Oren v.\nLibyan Arab Republic, 726 F.2d 774, 775\n(D.C.Cir.1984)) (Edwards, J., concurring)\n(some emphasis omitted). Courts in the\nSecond Circuit seem to take the opposite\napproach. ‘‘Although cast in terms that\nmay be read to require that only the injury\nrather than the tortious acts occur in the\nUnited States, the Supreme Court has\nheld that this exception ‘covers only torts\noccurring within the territorial jurisdiction\nof the United States.’ ’’ Cabiri v. Gov’t of\nthe Republic of Ghana, 165 F.3d 193, 200\nn. 3 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting Amerada Hess,\n488 U.S. at 441, 109 S.Ct. 683); see also\nHirsh v. State of Israel, 962 F.Supp. 377,\n383–84 (S.D.N.Y.1997) (citing legislative\nhistory stating both the tort and injury\nmust occur within the United States for\nthe exception to apply and dismissing complaint\nwhere plaintiffs failed to allege specific\ntort or place tort occurred); Kline,\n685 F.Supp. at 391 (finding tort exception\ninapplicable where victim was abducted in\nMexico City and brought to the United\n25. Judge Robertson recognized the same difficulty.\nAlthough he did consider Plaintiffs’s\nclaims under the tort exception, he found that\nthe language of the state sponsor of terrorism\nexception buttressed his ultimate conclusion\nthat the tortious acts exception would not\nprovide subject matter jurisdiction over\nPrince Sultan and Prince Turki. Unlike\n(a)(7), the tort exception ‘‘makes no mention\nof the ‘provision of material support.’ ’’ Burnett\nII, 292 F.Supp.2d at 20 n. 5. After reviewing\ncanons of statutory construction counseling\nthat Congress acts intentionally when it\nStates because ‘‘the entire tort must be\ncommitted in the United States’’).\nPlaintiffs allege that the Kingdom,\nPrince Sultan, and Prince Turki tortiously\naided and abetted the September 11 terrorists\nby supporting charities that, in\nturn, supported al Qaeda and international\nterrorism. Plaintiffs also claim that, in\nreturn for protection of the Kingdom,\nthese Defendants essentially willfully ignored\nthe threat that Osama bin Laden\nand al Qaeda posed to the United States.\nPlaintiffs do not claim that the Kingdom or\nthe Princes undertook any of their alleged\nacts in the United States. Yet, in the\nPlaintiffs’ view, the operative torts for the\nCourt’s consideration are the attacks of\nSeptember 11, which did take place in the\nUnited States. See Burnett II, 292\nF.Supp.2d at 19 n. 4 (noting death and\ninjuries occurred in United States). Further,\nPlaintiffs claim it would be unjust to\nallow foreign nations to escape liability for\ntortious acts performed in the United\nStates if they could show that some act of\nplanning the tort took place outside the\nUnited States.\nAdditionally, Defendants submit that,\nsince the allegations are precisely those\noutlined in § 1605(a)(7)—that is, ‘‘personal\ninjury or death that was caused by an act\nof TTT extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage\nTTT or the provision of material support\nor resources TTT for such an act’’—\nnone of the other exceptions should be\nread to apply in its place. 25 Defendants\nincludes particular language in one section of\na statute but omits it from another, Judge\nRobertson concluded that Congress’s omission\nof ‘provision of material support’ from\n(a)(5) should be treated as intentional. Id.;\nsee also HCSC–Laundry v. United States, 450\nU.S. 1, 6, 101 S.Ct. 836, 67 L.Ed.2d 1 (1980)\n(per curiam) (‘‘[I]t is a basic principle of\nstatutory construction that a specific statute\nTTT controls over a general provision TTT,\nparticularly when the two are interrelated\nand closely positioned.’’).\n796 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nargue the Court’s adjudication of Plaintiffs’\nclaims would interfere with the executive\nbranch’s discretion to designate state\nsponsors of terror. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(7)(A) (listing statutes that give\nSecretary of State authority to designate\ncountries as sponsors of terrorism). Finally,\nDefendants submit the purpose\nof(a)(5) was ‘‘to eliminate a foreign state’s\nimmunity for traffic accidents and other\ntorts committed in the United States, for\nwhich liability is imposed under domestic\ntort law.’’ Amerada Hess, 488 U.S. at\n439–40, 109 S.Ct. 683; Burnett II, 292\nF.Supp.2d at 19 (stating ‘‘the legislative\nhistory [of the FSIA] counsels that the\nexception should be narrowly construed so\nas not to encompass the farthest reaches\nof common law’’).\nPlaintiffs respond that if Congress intended\n(a)(5) and (a)(7) to be mutually\nexclusive or intended that (a)(5) never apply\nin the terrorism context, Congress\nwould have said so. Indeed, Congress did\nso very explicitly with respect to (a)(5) and\n(a)(2) and between (a)(7) and (a)(2). See\n§ 1605(a)(5) (explaining exception can only\nbe used in situations ‘‘not otherwise encompassed\nin paragraph (2)’’);\n§ 1605(a)(7) (same). To further buttress\ntheir argument, Plaintiffs note the two exceptions\nhave been interpreted to encompass\ndifferent situations. Subsection (a)(7)\ncovers acts of terrorism committed abroad\nby a state sponsor of terrorism, while subsection\n(a)(5) governs tortious acts, including\nterrorism, performed in the United\nStates. See Flatow v. Islamic Republic of\nIran, 999 F.Supp. 1, 15 (D.D.C.1998) (finding\n(a)(7) applied to conduct outside the\nUnited States and stating ‘‘28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(5) already provides jurisdiction\nover state-sponsored terrorist acts in the\nUnited States, TTT the state sponsored terrorism\nexception would be redundant if it\nwere held to apply only within the United\nStates’’). Again, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’\nargument of exclusivity would\nlead to absurd results, such that if a foreign\nsovereign not designated a state sponsor\nof terror was involved in a car accident\nstemming from negligence it would not be\nimmune; but if it undertook a deliberate\nact of violence it would enjoy immunity\nfrom suit.\nThe Court understands Plaintiffs’ desire\nto find a legal remedy for the horrible\nwrongs committed on September 11, 2001.\nIf appropriate, however, these Defendants\nare entitled to immunity from litigating\nthese gravely serious claims in this forum.\nCongress made a policy decision that the\nExecutive branch, and not the courts, have\nthe authority to label a foreign nation a\nterrorist. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(7)(A).\nBut when it drafted the state sponsor of\nterror exception it did not include mutually\nexclusive language that would preclude the\napplication of the torts exception here. It\ndid include such language with respect to\nthe commercial activities exception. See\n28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(7) (‘‘A foreign state\nshall not be immune from jurisdiction of\ncourts of the United States or of the States\nin any case—not otherwise covered by\nparagraph (2) above.’’); see also 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(5) (‘‘A foreign state shall not be\nimmune from jurisdiction of courts of the\nUnited States or of the States in any\ncase—not otherwise encompassed in paragraph\n(2) above.’’). Particularly in a case\nsuch as this where interests of sovereignty,\ncomity, international relations, and separation\nof powers are implicated, the Court\nmust be vigilant to exercise discipline to\napply the law only as it is written. While\nthere are certainly obstacles to (a)(5)’s application—and\nthe Court is not convinced\nthe Plaintiffs have or can overcome\nthem—the Court will not rule as a matter\nof law that subsections (a)(7) and (a)(5) are\nmutually exclusive. Accordingly, the\nCourt will consider Plaintiffs’ evidence\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n797\ndemonstrating the torts exception outlined\nin (a)(5) provides a basis for subject matter\njurisdiction here.\n[20] To fit within the exception outlined\nin § 1605(a)(5), the Plaintiffs must\ncome forward with evidence demonstrating\nthe Princes’ or Kingdom’s tortious acts or\nomissions caused Plaintiffs’ injuries. 26 28\nU.S.C. § 1605(a)(5); Virtual Countries,\n300 F.3d at 241; Cargill, 991 F.2d at 1016.\n‘‘Any terrorist act, including the September\n11 attacks, might have been the natural\nand probable consequence of knowingly\nand intentionally providing financial support\nto al Qaeda, given [the complaints’]\nallegations that, prior to September 11, al\nQaeda and Osama bin Laden had proclaimed\ntheir intentions to commit murderous\nterrorist activities against the United\nStates and its citizens, TTT and had accompanied\nthese words with actions by implementing,\nand publicly acknowledging responsibility\nfor, such terrorist schemes as\nthe 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center,\nthe 1998 attack of the U.S. embassies\nin Kenya and Tanzania, and the 2000 attack\nof the U.S.S.

Plaintiffs argue that Judge Robertson held\nthem to an unnecessarily stringent theory of\ncausation and submit that the D.C. Circuit’s\nsubsequent decision in Kilburn v. Socialist\nPeople’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 376 F.3d\n1123 (D.C.Cir.2004), effectively overrules the\nholding in Burnett II. See Kilburn, 376 F.3d at\n1129 (evaluating a claim under § 1605(a)(7)\nand holding the requirement for jurisdictional\ncausation was proximate cause). This Court\ndoes not read Burnett II as requiring but-for\ncausation and Defendants agreed at oral argument\nthat the proper inquiry at this stage of\na. Prince Sultan and Prince Turki\n[21] Both Princes are alleged to have\ntortiously aided and abetted terrorism\nthrough their contributions to, and support\nof, Islamic charities that they knew or\nshould have known were supporting terrorist\norganizations such as al Qaeda. 27\nAdditionally, Plaintiffs allege Prince Turki\naided and abetted the terrorists by attempting\nto deflect their activities away\nfrom Saudi Arabia and by serving as a\n‘‘facilitator of Osama bin Laden’s network\nof charities.’’ Ashton Complaint ¶ 261;\nBurnett Complaint ¶ 350. Plaintiffs allege\nboth Princes must have known that the\nUnited States would have been al Qaeda’s\ntarget, making the attacks on September\n11 a foreseeable result of the Princes’ actions.\n[22–24] Pursuant to the Second Circuit’s\ninstruction, the Court must first determine\nwhether the Princes’ acts are tortious\nunder New York law. Robinson, 269\nF.3d at 142. In New York, conspiracy and\naiding and abetting are varieties of concerted\naction liability. Pittman v. Grayson,\n149 F.3d 111, 122 (2d Cir.1998).\nThere must be ‘‘(1) an express or tacit\nagreement to ‘participate in a common\nplan or design to commit a tortious act,’ (2)\ntortious conduct by each defendant, and (3)\nthe commission by one of the defendants,\nin pursuance of the agreement, of an act\nthat constitutes a tort.’ ’’ Id. (quoting\nthe litigation is the presence of proximate\ncausation. See Sept. 14, 2004 Tr. at 121.\n27. To the extent that the consolidated Plaintiffs\nand the Federal Plaintiffs allege that\nPrince Sultan and Prince Turki made donations\nin their personal capacities, see, e.g.,\nAshton Complaint ¶ 269 (Prince Sultan); Federal\nComplaint ¶¶ 451–52 (Prince Turki),\nthose claims are not subject to the FSIA’s\nprotection.

Causation\nJudge Robertson found his consideration\nof Prince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s FSIA\ndefenses did not present an opportunity\nfor a general discourse on causation since\nPlaintiffs’ theory would stretch causation\nto ‘‘terra incognita.’’ Burnett II, 292\nF.Supp.2d at 20. This Court agrees with\nJudge Robertson’s conclusion, but it undertakes\nthe causation analysis because a\nsimilar review will be necessary in its consideration\nof the Defendants’ motions for\nfailure to state a claim. See Part III\nbelow.\nPlaintiffs place great reliance on Halberstam\nv. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C.Cir.1983)\nand Boim v. Quranic Literacy Institute. &\nHoly Land Foundation for Relief & Development,\n291 F.3d 1000, 1023 (7th Cir.2002)\n(‘‘Boim II ’’). Neither of these cases concern\nthe tortious activity exception to the\nFSIA, but they do explain liability under\nthe ATA and for aiding and abetting and\nconspiracy. 28 In Halberstam, the defendant\nwas found liable as a joint venturer\nfor a killing that occurred during a burglary\nat which she was not present. Halberstam,\n705 F.2d at 488; see also Lumbard\nv. Maglia, Inc., 621 F.Supp. 1529, 1536\n(S.D.N.Y.1985) (‘‘[T]hose who aid or abet\nor conspire in tortious conduct are jointly\nand severally liable with other participants\nin the tortious conduct, regardless of the\ndegree of their participation or culpability\nin the overall scheme.’’). The court found\nthat the defendant’s intimate relationship\nwith the burglar and her assistance in his\nother illegal ventures ‘‘defie[d] credulity\nthat [she] did not know that something\nillegal was afoot.’’ Halberstam, 705 F.2d\nat 486.\nIn Boim, the district court had denied a\nmotion to dismiss by U.S.-based charities\nalleged to have aided and abetted international\nterrorism. Boim v. Quranic Literacy\nInst. & Holy Land Found., 127\nF.Supp.2d 1002, 1018 (N.D.Ill.2001)\n(‘‘Boim I ’’). The Seventh Circuit affirmed\nthe decision and held that the parents of a\nyeshiva student killed in 1996 in Israel by\nmembers of the military wing of Hamas\ncould prove that the defendants aided and\nabetted their son’s murder under the ATA\nif they could demonstrate that the charities\n‘‘knew of Hamas’ illegal activities, that\nthey desired to help those activities succeed,\nand they engaged in some act of\nhelping the illegal activities.’’ Boim II,\n291 F.3d at 1023. The court explained\nthat ‘‘[f]oreseeability is the cornerstone of\n28. The court in Halberstam outlined the elements\nof aiding and abetting as: ‘‘(1) the\nparty whom the defendant aids must perform\na wrongful act that causes an injury; (2) the\ndefendant must be generally aware of his role\nas part of an overall illegal or tortious activity\nat the time that he provides the assistance;\n(3) the defendant must knowingly and substantially\nassist the principal violation.’’ Halberstam,\n705 F.2d at 477. It described the\nelements of civil conspiracy as: ‘‘(1) an agreement\nbetween two or more persons; (2) to\nparticipate in an unlawful act, or a lawful act\nin an unlawful manner; (3) an injury caused\nby an unlawful overt act performed by one of\nthe parties to the agreement; (4) which overt\nact was done pursuant to and in furtherance\nof the common scheme.’’ Id.\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n799\nproximate cause, and in tort law, a defendant\nwill be held liable only for those\ninjuries that might have reasonably been\nanticipated as a natural consequence of the\ndefendant’s actions.’’ Id. at 1012. Plaintiffs\nsubmit the court’s decision in Boim—\nthat the ATA was designed ‘‘to extend\nliability to all points along the causal chain\nof terrorism’’—supports the finding that\nPrince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s conduct\ncaused the attacks on September 11, 2001.\nId. at 1011.\nPlaintiffs exert much effort outlining the\nconnections between al Qaeda and the Defendant\ncharities that Prince Sultan and\nPrince Turki supported. Plaintiffs argue\nthat the indirect nature of the Princes’\ncontributions to al Qaeda is not fatal to\ntheir claims since they allegedly knew that\nfunds they donated to the Defendant charities\nwere being diverted to al Qaeda. See\nBierstein Aff. in Opp. to Prince Sultan’s\nMotion to Dismiss, Exs. 1–24. The Court\nhas reviewed the exhibits on which Plaintiffs\nrely and finds only a handful relate to\nPlaintiffs’ arguments.\nExhibit 11 is a report allegedly prepared\nfor the President of the U.N. Security\nCouncil regarding a Saudi connection to\nterror financing. The report mentions\nPrince Sultan once in his role as the head\nof the Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs\nand does not conclude or suggest that he\nhad any knowledge that charities to which\nhe allegedly donated were funneling money\nto al Qaeda.\nExhibit 12 is a statement by the former\nFrench Minister of the Interior in which\nhe claims to have met with Prince Sultan,\nPrince Turki, and other members of the\nSaudi Royal family in November 1994 and\nto have raised the ‘‘question of financial aid\nfurnished by Saudi charitable organizations\nenjoying state support TTT to Islamist\nmovements or terrorist groups.’’ The\nonly charity he names in his statement is\nthe World Islamic League, not one of the\ncharities to which the Princes allegedly\ndonated.\nExhibits 21–24 are excerpts from The\nMuslim World regarding Prince Sultan’s\ndonations to IIRO and the Joint Saudi\nCommittee for Relief of Kosovar Refugees\n(‘‘JSCR’’). There is no indication in these\nexhibits that IIRO or JSCR was funneling\ndonations to al Qaeda. Even construing\nthese allegations and exhibits in the light\nmost favorable to Plaintiffs, and drawing\nall inferences in their favor, none of these\nexhibits amount to admissible evidence\nthat Prince Sultan or Prince Turki knew\nthe charities they supported were fronts\nfor al Qaeda.\nAlternatively, Plaintiffs argue that, since\nOsama bin Laden and al Qaeda made no\neffort to hide their hatred for the United\nStates, Prince Sultan and Prince Turki had\nto have been aware that the United States\nwas a target, making the atrocities of September\n11, 2001 a foreseeable result of\ntheir actions. See, e.g., Bierstein Aff. in\nOpp. to Prince Sultan’s Motion to Dismiss,\nExs. 2–10, 14, 15, 18, 20 (including reports\nand fatwas summarizing Osama bin Laden’s\nand al Qaeda’s repeated public threats\nto and denouncement of the United\nStates). There is no question that in the\nyears leading up to the September 11 attacks,\nOsama bin Laden and al Qaeda were\nincreasingly vocal in their hatred of the\nUnited States and its interests. The question\nremains, however, whether Plaintiffs\nhave adequately alleged that Prince Sultan’s\nand Prince Turki’s specific acts aided\nand abetted those terrorists.\nBoth Prince Sultan and Prince Turki\nclaim Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate their\nalleged tortious activity caused Plaintiffs’\ninjuries. They argue that Plaintiffs ignore\nthat Osama bin Laden also targeted the\nSaudi Royal family. See, e.g., Bierstein\nAff. in Opp. to Prince Sultan’s Motion to\n800 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nDismiss, Ex. 16 (Prince Turki, ‘‘Allied\nAgainst Terrorism,’’ September 17, 2002,\nWashington Post, editorial in which Prince\nTurki explains the Saudis’ practice of sharing\ninformation regarding Osama bin Laden\nand al Qaeda with the CIA and states\nthat al Qaeda also targeted the Kingdom);\nExs. 3, 5, 6 (fatwas issued by Osama bin\nLaden and Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman\ntargeting Americans and expressing extreme\nbitterness toward the Saudi Royal\nfamily). Prince Sultan argues that Plaintiffs\nblur the distinction between charities\nhe is on record of supporting, IIRO and\nWAMY, and those he is not, Al Haramain\nand MWL. See supra note 20. Both\nPrinces also distinguish the instant case\nfrom Boim and other cases cited by the\nPlaintiffs on the basis that groups that\nthey are alleged to have supported were\nnot designated as terrorist organizations\nby the United States government. See\nBoim II, 291 F.3d at 1002 (noting Hamas\nwas designated a terrorist organization by\nPresident Clinton in 1995 and by the Secretary\nof State in 1997); see also Consolidated\nPlaintiffs’ Opp. to Prince Sultan’s\nMotion to Dismiss at 16–17 (citing Flatow,\n999 F.Supp. at 18 (holding Iran, a state\nsponsor of terrorism, liable as provider of\nmaterial support to terrorist organization\nPalestine Islamic Jihad pursuant to 18\nU.S.C. § 1605(a)(7)); Smith v. Islamic\nEmirate of Afghanistan, 262 F.Supp.2d\n217, 232 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (granting default\njudgment against Iraq, a designated state\nsponsor of terror, after plaintiffs demonstrated\nit provided material support to\nOsama bin Laden and al Qaeda)); Consolidated\nPlaintiffs’ Opp. to Prince Turki’s\nMotion to Dismiss at 8 (same).\nAlthough they did not involve New York\nlaw, the Court agrees that Halberstam\nand Boim are instructive. In Halberstam,\nthe defendant enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle\nmade entirely possible by her longterm\nlive-in boyfriend’s regular burglaries.\nThe court concluded that she had to know\nof his criminal activities because she acted\nas a money launderer for her boyfriend’s\nstolen metals business. Halberstam, 705\nF.2d at 486–88. The court found the defendant\nwas so close to the illegal activity\nthat she had to be aware of her role in it.\nId. at 486. In Boim, the court denied the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss because the\ncomplaint contained specific factual allegations\ntying the defendants to Hamas. For\nexample, one defendant entity allegedly\nemployed an individual designated as a\nterrorist affiliated with Hamas, another\nentity admitted providing funds to Hamas,\ntwo individual defendants had documented\nand admitted ties to Hamas, and numerous\nlinks existed between the individual\nterrorist defendants and the entity defendants.\nBoim I, 127 F.Supp.2d at 1006–\n1008. Unlike Hamas in Boim, none of the\norganizations the Princes are alleged to\nhave supported in an official capacity were\ndesignated a sponsor of terrorism at the\ntime of the alleged contributions. In fact,\nonly BIF and certain branches of Al Haramain\nhave since been designated. See\nExec. Order No. 13224 (designating BIF\n(November 19, 2002) and branches of Al\nHaramain (Bosnia, Somalia on March 11,\n2002; Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, Tanzania\non January 22, 2004; Afghanistan, Albania,\nBangladesh, Ethiopia, the Netherlands\non June 2, 2004)). Thus, pursuant\nto Boim, the Plaintiffs would have to allege\nspecific facts showing that the\nPrinces knew or should have known that\nthe charities they supported were actually\nfronts for al Qaeda. See Burnett I, 274\nF.Supp.2d at 106.\n[25–27] Plaintiffs have pleaded al Qaeda’s\nrepeated, public targeting of the United\nStates. They have not, however, pleaded\nfacts to support an inference that the\nPrinces were sufficiently close to the terrorists’\nillegal activities to satisfy Halber-\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n801\nstam or New York law. Similarly, Plaintiffs\nhave not pleaded facts to suggest the\nPrinces knew they were making contributions\nto terrorist fronts and provided substantial\nassistance or encouragement to\nthe terrorists to satisfy Boim or New York\nlaw. The Court has reviewed the complaints\nin their entirety and finds no allegations\nfrom which it can infer that the\nPrinces knew the charities to which they\ndonated were fronts for al Qaeda. The\nCourt is not ruling as a matter of law that\na defendant cannot be liable for contributions\nto organizations that are not themselves\ndesignated terrorists. But in such a\ncase, there must be some facts presented\nto support the allegation that the defendant\nknew the receiving organization to be\na solicitor, collector, supporter, front or\nlaunderer for such an entity. There must\nbe some facts to support an inference that\nthe defendant knowingly provided assistance\nor encouragement to the wrongdoer.\nHere, there are no such factual bases presented,\nthere are only conclusions. See\nRobinson, 269 F.3d at 146 (‘‘[W]e note that\nthe conclusory nature of [plaintiff’s] allegations\nalone would give us pause before we\nwould allow them to sustain jurisdiction.’’)\n(citing Zappia Middle East Const. Co. v.\nEmirate of Abu Dhabi, 215 F.3d 247, 253\n(2d Cir.2000) (finding, in context of FSIA\n12(b)(1) motion, conclusory allegations in\nplaintiffs affidavit insufficient to sustain\njurisdiction)). The law does not permit\nPlaintiffs\nto circumvent the jurisdictional hurdle of\nthe FSIA by inserting vague and conclusory\nallegations of tortious conduct in\ntheir complaints—and then TTT rely on\nthe federal courts to conclude that some\nconceivable non-discretionary tortious\nact falls within the purview of these\ngeneric allegations under the applicable\nsubstantive law. This is at odds with\nthe goal of the FSIA to enable a foreign\ngovernment to obtain an early dismissal\nwhen the substance of the claim against\nit does not support jurisdiction.\nRobinson, 269 F.3d at 146.\nii. Discretionary Function\nPlaintiffs argue that there is no discretion\nto conduct illegal activities and the\nso-called discretionary function exception\nto the tortious act exception should not\napply to Prince Sultan or Prince Turki.\nSee, e.g., Liu v. Republic of China, 892\nF.2d 1419, 1421, 1431 (9th Cir.1989) (finding\nno discretion to violate Chinese law\nprohibiting murder where gunmen acting\non direction of China’s Director of Defense\nIntelligence Bureau killed plaintiff’s\nhusband); Birnbaum v. United States,\n588 F.2d 319, 329–30 (2d Cir.1978) (finding\nin FTCA case that the CIA had no\nauthority and therefore no discretion to\nopen U.S. first class mail departing for\nand arriving from the Soviet Union);\nGlickman v. United States, 626 F.Supp.\n171, 175 (S.D.N.Y.1985) (finding in FTCA\ncase that CIA agent’s secret administration\nof LSD to plaintiff was not discretionary\nfunction); Letelier v. Republic of Chile,\n488 F.Supp. 665, 673 (D.D.C.1980)\n(holding no discretion to order or aid assassination\nof former Chilean ambassador\nand foreign minister). Prince Sultan insists\nthat any recommendation of government\ngrants to Islamic charities was a\ndiscretionary function. Prince Turki\nmakes a similar argument regarding his\nactions as the head of DGI and urges the\nCourt to find that all of his alleged actions\nshould be subsumed by the discretionary\nfunction exception.\n[28] The Court finds the discretionary\nfunction exception independently bars\nPlaintiffs’ claims against Prince Sultan and\nPrince Turki. Both Princes are accused of\ndonating money or recommending government\ngrants to charities that allegedly supported\nal Qaeda. As the head of DGI,\n802 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nPrince Turki is also alleged to have attempted\nto protect Saudi Arabia from terrorism\nand to have implemented the Kingdom’s\nforeign relations with the Taliban\nand Osama bin Laden. In determining\nwhether these were discretionary functions,\nthe Court must decide whether the\nactions involved an element of choice or\njudgment based on considerations of public\npolicy. See Callahan v. United States, 329\nF.Supp.2d 404, 408 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (interpreting\nFTCA); Berkovitz v. United\nStates, 486 U.S. 531, 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954,\n100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988) (construing FTCA).\n[29, 30] There can be little doubt that,\nas the chairman of the Supreme Council of\nIslamic Affairs, charged with making recommendations\nto the Council of Ministers\nregarding requests for aid from Islamic\norganizations located abroad, and as the\nhead of the Special Committee of the\nCouncil of Ministers, charged with deciding\nwhich grants should be made to Islamic\ncharities, Prince Sultan’s decisions were\nmade at the planning level of government,\nKline, 685 F.Supp. at 392, and ‘‘grounded\nin social, economic, and political policy,’’\nVarig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814, 104 S.Ct.\n2755. Similarly, as the head of DGI,\nPrince Turki’s decisions regarding the\ntreatment of the Taliban and Osama bin\nLaden were judgments based on considerations\nof public policy. See Callahan v.\nUnited States, 329 F.Supp.2d at 408; see\nalso Burnett II, 292 F.Supp.2d at 20–21\n(‘‘[T]his conclusion would be nearly selfevident:\nPrince Turki, as director of intelligence,\ntaking acts to protect Saudi Arabia\nfrom terrorism, and Prince Sultan, as\nchairman of the Supreme Council, making\nrecommendations to the Council of Ministers\nabout requests for assistance from\nIslamic organizations outside Saudi Arabia\nor, as head of the Special Committee, deciding\nwhat disbursements should be made\nto Islamic charitable organizations, were\nclearly making ‘decisions grounded in social,\neconomic, and political policy.’ ’’)\n(quoting Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814,\n104 S.Ct. 2755).\nAccordingly, to the extent that Plaintiffs\nallege acts Prince Sultan and Prince Turki\nperformed in their official capacities,\nPrince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s motions\nto dismiss the certain consolidated complaints\n29 and the Federal complaint are\ngranted. The Court denies Plaintiffs’ request\nfor jurisdictional discovery because\nPlaintiffs have not presented any factual\nbasis for believing that discovery might\nreasonably be expected to result in evidence\nthat would overcome the discretionary\nfunction exception. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(5)(A) (exception not applicable to\n‘‘any claim based upon the exercise or\nperformance or the failure to exercise or\nperform a discretionary function regardless\nof whether the discretion be abused.’’)\nThe Court will consider the appropriateness\nof exercising personal jurisdiction\nover Prince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s\npersonal acts in Part II below.\nb. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nThere is no dispute that the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia is a foreign state within the\nmeaning of the FSIA. Federal Complaint\n¶ 63. The Federal Plaintiffs have the\n‘‘burden of going forward with evidence\nthat, under exceptions to the FSIA, immunity\nshould not be granted.’’ Virtual\nCountries, 300 F.3d at 241 (internal quotations\nomitted). As explained above, the\nonly possible applicable exception is the\ntorts exception under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(5).\n[31, 32] The Federal Plaintiffs’ allegations\narise ‘‘predominantly from miscon-\n29. The consolidated complaints are Ashton, Barrera, Burnett, Salvo, and Tremksy.\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n803\nduct of ostensible charities under the\nKingdom’s control.’’ Federal Opp. to Motion\nto Dismiss of the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia at 1. 30 Thus, the Federal Plaintiffs\nclaim the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia aided\nand abetted the terrorists through these\ncharities. In attempting to overcome the\npresumption of the Kingdom’s sovereign\nimmunity, the Federal Plaintiffs argue the\nmerits of their claims against the charities.\n31 Based on news accounts that the\nKingdom has dissolved its international\ncharities and terrorist financing reports\nthat implicate certain charities, the Federal\nPlaintiffs urge the Court to find that the\nKingdom had previously willfully ignored\nthe charities’ support for terrorism. See,\ne.g., Federal Opp. to Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia Motion to Dismiss Ex. 2 (‘‘Terrorist\nFinancing, Report of an Independent Task\nForce Sponsored by the Council on Foreign\nRelations’’), Ex. 3 (CNN.com June 2,\n2004 ‘‘Saudis reform charities as antiterror\nmeasure’’ (mentioning only Al Haramain\nIslamic Foundation)), Ex. 5 (Senate Subcommittee\nTestimony, July 31, 2003 by\nSteven Emerson with Jonathan Levin,\n‘‘Terrorism Financing: Origination, Organization,\nand Prevention: Saudi Arabia,\nTerrorist Financing and the War on Terror’’).\n30. The Federal Plaintiffs allege that each of\nthe following charities, which are all named\nas Defendants and represented by counsel in\nthese actions, are agencies, instrumentalities,\narms or organs of the Kingdom: MWL, IIRO,\nWAMY, Al Haramain Islamic Foundation, Saudi\nHigh Commission for Relief to Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, SJRC, Rabita Trust, Saudi Red\nCrescent, and BIF. The Kingdom disputes the\ninstrumentality status of MWL, IIRO, WAMY,\nAl Haramain Islamic Foundation, Rabita\nTrust, and BIF. These Plaintiffs request discovery\nas to the instrumentality status of these\ncharities. The request is denied at this time\nand may be more appropriate when the Court\nconsiders each of the charities’ motions to\ndismiss.\nIn response, the Kingdom argues that\nPlaintiffs ignore Osama bin Laden’s public\ntargeting of the Kingdom. See, e.g., Bierstein\nAff. in Opp. to Prince Sultan’s Motion\nto Dismiss, Ex. 3 & 4; The 9/11 Commission\nReport: Final Report of the National\nCommission on Terrorist Attacks Upon\nthe United States, 48, 373 (July 2004)\n(hereinafter ‘‘9/11 Report ’’). The Kingdom\nalso submits it has worked with the\nUnited States to share information in the\nfight against terrorism. 9/11 Report, at\n115–22; Prince Turki Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8, 10.\nThe U.S. State Department has not designated\nthe Kingdom a state sponsor of terrorism.\nAdditionally, the presidentiallyappointed\nSeptember 11 commission found\nno evidence of the Kingdom’s funding or\nsupport for the September 11 terrorists.\n9/11 Report, at 171 (‘‘[W]e have found no\nevidence that the Saudi government as an\ninstitution or senior Saudi officials individually\nfunded the organization.’’).\nThe Court finds the Plaintiffs’ allegations\ncannot overcome the discretionary\nfunction exception to the tortious acts exception.\nMarchisella v.

Rather than pleading specific facts showing\nthat the Kingdom caused Plaintiffs’ injuries,\nthe Federal Plaintiffs focus predominantly\non the charities’ actions. For example,\nthese Plaintiffs argue that the Kingdom has\nwaived the defense of sovereign immunity because\ncertain charities, which have not been\ndesignated as instrumentalities of the Kingdom\nand which are represented by separate\ncounsel, did not raise the FSIA defense in\ntheir motions to dismiss. The Court is not\nconvinced by this argument because the waiver\nof FSIA immunity must be explicit. See\nBanco de Seguros del Estado v. Mutual Marine\nOffice, Inc., 344 F.3d 255, 261 (2d Cir.2003).\n804 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\ntions would not sustain jurisdiction).

The Federal\nPlaintiffs have not met their burden of\ndemonstrating an exception to the FSIA\napplies to negate the Kingdom’s immunity.\n‘‘[S]overeign immunity under the FSIA is\nimmunity from suit, not just from liability.’’\nMoran v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\n27 F.3d 169, 172 (5th Cir.1994). Because\nthere were no factual disputes raised in\nthe Court’s resolution of this motion, no\njurisdictional discovery is necessary. See\nFiletech S.A. v. France Telecom S.A., 304\nF.3d 180, 183 (2d Cir.2002). The Kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia’s motion to dismiss the\nFederal complaint for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction is granted.\nII. Personal Jurisdiction\n[33–36] To avoid dismissal for lack of\npersonal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2),\nPlaintiffs must establish personal jurisdiction\nover each Defendant. Bank Brussels\nLambert v. Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodriguez,\n171 F.3d 779, 784 (2d Cir.1999). Because\nthese motions are brought before discovery\nand decided without an evidentiary\nhearing, Plaintiffs need only make a prima\nfacie showing that personal jurisdiction exists.\nPDK Labs, Inc. v. Friedlander, 103\nF.3d 1105, 1108 (2d Cir.1997); A.I. Trade\nFinance, Inc. v. Petra Bank, 989 F.2d 76,\n79 (2d Cir.1993). Plaintiffs may rely entirely\non factual allegations, Jazini v. Nissan\nMotor Co., 148 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir.\n1998), and they will prevail even if Defendants\nmake contrary arguments, A.I\nTrade, 989 F.2d at 79. In resolving the\nmotions, the Court will read the complaints\nand affidavits in a light most favorable\nto Plaintiffs. PDK Labs, 103 F.3d at\n1108. It will not, however, accept legally\nconclusory assertions or draw ‘‘argumentative\ninferences.’’ Mende v. Milestone\nTech., Inc., 269 F.Supp.2d 246, 251\n(S.D.N.Y.2003) (citing Robinson v. Overseas\nMilitary Sales Corp., 21 F.3d 502, 507\n(2d Cir.1994)).\nA. Bases for Personal Jurisdiction\n1. New York Long–Arm Statute\n[37] ‘‘In a federal question case where\na defendant resides outside the forum\nstate, a federal court applies the forum\nstate’s personal jurisdiction rules if the\nfederal statute does not specifically provide\nfor national service of process.’’ PDK\nLabs, 103 F.3d at 1108. Similarly, a federal\ncourt sitting in diversity exercises personal\njurisdiction over a foreign defendant\nto the same extent as courts of general\njurisdiction of the state in which it sits\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n4(k)(1)(A). Bank Brussels Lambert\nv. Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodriguez, 305 F.3d\n120, 124 (2d Cir.2002). In such cases,\ncourts must determine if New York law\nwould confer jurisdiction through its longarm\nstatute, and then decide if the exercise\nof such jurisdiction comports with the\nrequisites of due process under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Id. (citing Bank\nBrussels, 171 F.3d at 784); Bensusan\nRest. Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d 25, 27 (2d\nCir.1997).\na. Conspiracy Theory\nPlaintiffs claim that New York’s longarm\nstatute provides a basis for personal\njurisdiction. Rule 302(a)(2) of New York’s\nCivil Practice Law & Rules states in part:\n‘‘(a) As to a cause of action arising from\nany of the acts enumerated in this section,\na court may exercise personal jurisdiction\nover any non-domiciliary, or his executor\nor administrator, who in person or through\nan agent TTT (2) commits a tortious act\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n805\nwithin the state TTTT’’ N.Y. C.P.L.R.\n§ 302(a)(2) (McKinney 2002). Courts have\ndefined ‘‘agent’’ to include a defendant’s\nco-conspirators ‘‘under certain circumstances.’’\nChrysler Capital Corp. v.

Thus, ‘‘acts committed in\nNew York by the co-conspirator of an outof-state\ndefendant pursuant to a conspiracy\nmay subject the out-of-state defendant\nto jurisdiction under C.P.L.R. 302(a)(2).’’\nChrysler Capital Corp. 778 F.Supp. at\n1266.\n[38–40] Plaintiffs are not required to\nestablish the existence of a ‘‘formal agency\nrelationship’’ between the Defendants and\ntheir putative co-conspirators.

Yet, ‘‘the bland\nassertion of conspiracy TTT is insufficient\nto establish jurisdiction for the purposes of\nsection 302(a)(2).’’ Lehigh Valley Indus.\nInc., 527 F.2d at 93–94; Lamarr v. Klein,\n35 A.D.2d 248, 315 N.Y.S.2d 695, 697–98\n(1st Dep’t 1970) (holding that conclusory\nstatements about defendant’s role in conspiracy\nwere insufficient to establish jurisdiction\nunder the co-conspirator doctrine).\nTo establish personal jurisdiction on a conspiracy\ntheory, Plaintiffs must make a prima\nfacie showing of conspiracy, allege specific\nfacts warranting the inference that\nthe defendant was a member of the conspiracy,\nand show that the defendant’s coconspirator\ncommitted a tort in New York.\nChrysler Capital Corp., 778 F.Supp. at\n1266 (citing Singer v. Bell, 585 F.Supp.\n300, 302 (S.D.N.Y.1984)).\n[41] ‘‘To plead a valid cause of action\nfor conspiracy under New York law, a\nplaintiff must allege the primary tort and\nfour elements: ‘(a) a corrupt agreement\nbetween two or more persons, (b) an overt\nact in furtherance of the agreement, (c) the\nparties’ intentional participation in the furtherance\nof a plan or purpose, and (d) the\nresulting damage or injury.’ ’’ Chrysler\nCapital Corp. 778 F.Supp. at 1267 (quoting\nKashi v. Gratsos, 790 F.2d 1050, 1055 (2d\nCir.1986)). To warrant the inference that\na defendant was a member of the conspiracy,\nPlaintiffs must show that ‘‘(a) the defendant\nhad an awareness of the effects in\nNew York of its activity; (b) the activity of\nthe co-conspirators in New York was to\nthe benefit of the out-of-state conspirators;\nand (c) the co-conspirators acting in New\nYork acted ‘at the direction or under the\ncontrol’ or ‘at the request of or on behalf\nof’ the out-of-state defendant.’’ Chrysler\nCapital Corp., 778 F.Supp. at 1268–69\n(quoting Dixon v. Mack, 507 F.Supp. 345,\n350 (S.D.N.Y.1980)).\n‘‘Whether an alleged conspiracy TTT existed\nis ‘a mixed question of law and\nfact.’ ’’ Daventree, 349 F.Supp.2d 736, at\n760, 2004 WL 2997881, at *19 (quoting\nMario Valente Collezioni Ltd. v. Confezioni\nSemeraro Paolo, S.R.L., 264 F.3d 32,\n36 (2d Cir.2001)). Accordingly, the Court\ncannot accept ‘‘conclusory assertions on\nthose issues; instead it must resolve such\nquestions based upon an independent examination\nof the factual allegations while\nmindful of its duty to draw all factual\ninferences in plaintiffs’ favor.’’ Id. (rejecting\nconspiracy theory of personal jurisdiction\nwithout permitting jurisdictional discovery).\n[42] Plaintiffs claim that all Defendants\nin these actions conspired with the al\nQaeda terrorists to perpetrate the attacks\nof September 11. See, e.g., Ashton Complaint\n¶ 296; Federal Complaint ¶¶ 66, 72–\n74. Without supporting factual allegations,\nsuch a statement is insufficient to\nestablish an agency relationship. Lehigh\nValley Indus. Inc., 527 F.2d at 93–94; Daventree,\n349 F.Supp.2d 736 at 762–63, 2004\n806 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nWL 2997881, at *22 (citing First Capital\nAsset Mgmt. v. Brickellbush, Inc. 218\nF.Supp.2d 369, 395 (S.D.N.Y.2002)). As\nwill be highlighted below, the complaints\ndo not allege any specific facts from which\nthe Court could infer that Prince Sultan,\nPrince Turki, Mohammed Abdullah Aljomaih,\nSheikh Hamad Al–Husani, or Abdulrahman\nbin Mahfouz directed, controlled,\nor requested al Qaeda to undertake its\nterrorist activities. Nor are there any\nspecific allegations of their knowledge of,\nor consent to those activities. See Daventree,\n349 F.Supp.2d 736 at 762–63, 2004\nWL 2997881, at *22 (finding no personal\njurisdiction under a conspiracy theory because\nthere was no basis from which the\ncourt could impute to defendants the conduct\nof their putative co-conspirators);\nChrysler Capital Corp., 778 F.Supp. at\n1266 (requiring specific facts warranting\nthe inference that the defendant was a\nmember of the conspiracy). Accordingly,\nfor Prince Sultan, Prince Turki, Mohammed\nAbdullah Aljomaih, Sheik Hamad\nAl–Husani, and Abdulrahman bin Mahfouz,\npersonal jurisdiction cannot be based\non a New York long-arm conspiracy theory.\nThe Court will examine the possibility\nof exercising conspiracy theory personal\njurisdiction over the remaining moving Defendants\nwhen it examines the specific\nclaims against each of them below.\n32. Although the Court does not have subject\nmatter jurisdiction over any of the moving\nDefendants pursuant to the FSIA, that statute\nalso provides for personal jurisdiction if service\nis proper and subject matter jurisdiction\nhas been established. 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b)\n(‘‘[P]ersonal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant\nshall exist as to every claim for relief of\nwhich the district courts have jurisdiction TTT\nwhere service has been made under section\n1608 of this title.’’); Rein v. Socialist People’s\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, 995 F.Supp. 325,\n329–330 (E.D.N.Y.1998).\n33. The Federal Plaintiffs pursue claims under\nRICO, which some courts outside the Second\n2. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n4(k)\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n4(k)(1)(D), service of process will establish\npersonal jurisdiction over a defendant\nwhen so authorized by a federal statute. 32\nHere, the ATA contains a nationwide service\nof process provision, such that proper\nservice will confer personal jurisdiction. 33\n18 U.S.C. § 2334(a) (providing for nationwide\nservice of process and venue); Burnett\nI, 274 F.Supp.2d at 95–96. Courts\nasked to analyze personal jurisdiction under\nthe ATA’s national service of process\nprovision have concluded that a plaintiff\n‘‘must demonstrate that the defendant has\nsufficient minimum contacts to satisfy a\ntraditional due process analysis.’’ Estates\nof Ungar v. Palestinian Auth., 153\nF.Supp.2d 76, 95 (D.R.I.2001); see also\nBiton v. Palestinian Interim Self–Gov’t\nAuth., 310 F.Supp.2d 172, 179 (D.D.C.\n2004) (dismissing complaint pursuant to 18\nU.S.C. § 2333 because individual defendants\nlacked contacts with the United\nStates). ‘‘The relevant inquiry under such\ncircumstances is whether the defendant\nhas minimum contacts with the United\nStates as a whole [to satisfy Fifth Amendment\ndue process requirements], rather\nthan TTT with the particular state in which\nthe federal court sits.’’ Ungar, 153\nF.Supp.2d at 87. Many of the moving\nCircuit have held also provides for nationwide\nservice of process and jurisdiction. See 18\nU.S.C. § 1965; Republic of Panama v. BCCI\nHoldings (Luxembourg) S.A., 119 F.3d 935,\n942 (11th Cir.1997) (finding 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1965(d) provides for nationwide jurisdiction);\ncf. PT United Can Co. Ltd. v. Crown\nCork & Seal Co., Inc., 138 F.3d 65, 71 (2d\nCir.1998) (finding ‘‘ § 1965 does not provide\nfor nationwide personal jurisdiction over every\ndefendant in every civil RICO case, no\nmatter where the defendant is found’’). The\nFederal Plaintiffs do not use their RICO\nclaims as a basis for personal jurisdiction and\nthe Court focuses on the ATA.\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n807\nDefendants either dispute the manner in\nwhich they were served or were not served\nin the United States. Accordingly, the\nCourt must consider an alternative basis\nfor personal jurisdiction.\n[43] If the New York long-arm statute\nor the ATA does not establish personal\njurisdiction, the Court will engage in a\nRule 4(k)(2) analysis. Rule 4(k)(2) states:\nIf the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent\nwith the Constitution and laws of\nthe United States, serving a summons or\nfiling a waiver of service is also effective,\nwith respect to claims arising under federal\nlaw, to establish personal jurisdiction\nover the person of any defendant\nwho is not subject to the jurisdiction of\nthe courts of general jurisdiction of any\nstate.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(2). Rule 4(k)(2) ‘‘fill[s] a\ngap in the enforcement of federal law’’ for\ncourts to exercise personal jurisdiction\nover defendants with sufficient contacts\nwith the United States generally, but insufficient\ncontacts with any one state in\nparticular. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(2) advisory\ncommittee’s note; United States v. Int’l\nBhd. of Teamsters, 945 F.Supp. 609, 616–\n17 (S.D.N.Y.1996). For jurisdiction under\nRule 4(k)(2), there must be a federal claim,\npersonal jurisdiction must not exist over\nthe defendant in New York or any other\nstate, and the defendant must have sufficient\ncontacts with the United States as a\nwhole such that the exercise of jurisdiction\ndoes not violate Fifth Amendment due process.\nInt’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 945 F.Supp.\nat 617.\na. Purposefully Directed Activities\nTheory\nPersonal jurisdiction based on Rule 4(k)\nrequires minimum contacts with the United\nStates to satisfy Fifth Amendment due\nprocess requirements. Plaintiffs claim\nthese requirements are met because Defendants\npurposefully directed their activities\nat the United States. Burger King v.\nRudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472, 479, 105\nS.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (explaining\njurisdiction is appropriate if defendant\n‘‘purposefully directed his activities at residents\nof the forum and the litigation results\nfrom alleged injuries that arise out of\nor relate to those activities’’ and finding\nminimum contacts existed since dispute\narose from a contract with substantial contacts\nwith the forum) (internal quotations\nand citations omitted); Calder v.

Pursuant to the holdings\nin Burger King, Calder, and three\nrecent terrorism cases—Rein v. Socialist\nPeople’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 995\nF.Supp. 325 (E.D.N.Y.1998), Daliberti v.\nRepublic of Iraq, 97 F.Supp.2d 38 (D.D.C.\n2000), and Pugh v. Socialist People’s Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya, 290 F.Supp.2d 54\n(D.D.C.2003)—Plaintiffs submit that the\nmoving Defendants knew that the primary\ntarget of Osama bin Laden’s and al Qaeda’s\ncampaign of terror was the United\nStates and that by providing assistance to\nthese terrorists, who Plaintiffs claim were\nDefendants’ co-conspirators, Defendants\naimed their conduct at the United States.\nIn Rein, the court denied defendants’\nmotions to dismiss for lack of subject matter\nand personal jurisdiction in a case aris-\n808 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\ning from the bombing of Pan Am Flight\n103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The court\nfound it had subject matter jurisdiction\nover defendant Libya, a designated state\nsponsor of terror, pursuant to § 1605(a)(7)\nof the FSIA. Rein, 995 F.Supp. at 329–30.\nNoting that the FSIA provides for personal\njurisdiction as long as subject matter\njurisdiction exists and proper service was\neffected, the court turned to Libya’s contacts\nwith the United States. Id. at 330\n(citing Burger King, 471 U.S. at 472, 105\nS.Ct. 2174). It found that Libya’s contacts\nwith the United States were sufficient because\nits allegedly ‘‘intentional, tortious actions\n[were] TTT ‘expressly aimed at’ the\nUnited States,’’ and included ‘‘destruction\nof a United States flag aircraft TTT while\nen route to the United States TTT with 189\nUnited States nationals on board.’’ Id.\n(citing Calder, 465 U.S. at 789, 104 S.Ct.\n1482). The court concluded that its exercise\nof personal jurisdiction was appropriate\nsince ‘‘[a]ny foreign state would know\nthat the United States has substantial interests\nin protecting its flag carriers and\nits nationals from terrorist activities and\nshould reasonably expect that if these interests\nwere harmed, it would be subject\nto a variety of potential responses, including\ncivil actions in the United States.’’ Id.\nSimilarly, in Daliberti the court found it\nhad subject matter jurisdiction over defendant\nIraq, a designated state sponsor of\nterror, in a case stemming from the alleged\ntorture of several United States citizens\nwho were working in Kuwait. Daliberti,\n97 F.Supp.2d at 46. Iraq argued\nthat exercising personal jurisdiction over it\nwould offend constitutional due process\nsince the FSIA ‘‘abrogates the minimum\ncontacts requirement.’’ Id. at 52. The\ncourt disagreed and explained that ‘‘Congress\nexpressly addressed the minimum\ncontacts requirement in enacting the FSIA\nby providing that ‘[p]ersonal jurisdiction\nover a foreign state shall exist as to every\nclaim for relief over which the district\ncourts have jurisdiction.’ ’’ Id. (citing 28\nU.S.C. § 1330(b); Shapiro v. Republic of\nBolivia, 930 F.2d 1013, 1020 (2d Cir.1991)).\nThe court acknowledged that the foreign\nstate’s contacts with the United States\nmight be more attenuated in the context of\nthe state sponsor of terrorism exception\nthan in the FSIA’s other exceptions, but\nconcluded ‘‘in the context of this statute,\nthe purpose for which it was enacted, and\nthe nature of the activity toward which it\nis directed, TTT it is reasonable that foreign\nstates be held accountable in the\ncourts of the United States for terrorist\nactions perpetrated against U.S. citizens\nanywhere.’’ Id. at 54. Finally, it noted\nthat the ‘‘detention of these three plaintiffs\nhad a direct effect in the United States\nand was consciously designed to affect\nUnited States policy TTT Iraq cannot now\nclaim surprise at the assertion of jurisdiction\nby this Court.’’ Id.\nMost recently, in Pugh, representatives\nof passengers killed in the bombing of a\nFrench airliner in Africa survived a motion\nto dismiss by the individual defendants.\nThe court found it had subject matter jurisdiction\nover seven Libyan officials, including\nMuammar Qadhafi, pursuant to\nthe state sponsor of terrorism exception of\nthe FSIA outlined in § 1605(a)(7). Pugh,\n290 F.Supp.2d at 58. In its personal jurisdiction\nanalysis, the court concluded that\nthe individuals had sufficient contacts with\nthe United States to satisfy due process\nsince they had ‘‘conspired to sabotage’’ a\nflight, which was scheduled to ‘‘stop in\nseveral nations,’’ thus making it foreseeable\nthat ‘‘passengers of many nationalities\nwould be on board.’’ Id. at 59. From\ntheir actions, the defendants could have\nexpected to be haled into ‘‘the courts of\nthose nations whose citizens would die.’’\nId. Given the number of passengers on the\nplane, it was also foreseeable that Ameri-\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n809\ncans would be on board. Id. Finally, the\ncourt reasoned that the ‘‘interest of the\nUnited States in preventing and punishing\ninternational terrorism has been a matter\nof worldwide common knowledge for\nyears.’’ Id. (citing statutes criminalizing\nterrorist acts). ‘‘It logically follows that if\nfederal courts may constitutionally exercise\ncriminal jurisdiction over such individuals,\nthe Constitution should be no bar to\nthose same federal courts, in a civil action\nTTT exercising civil in personam jurisdiction\nover those same individuals for the\nsame acts.’’ Id.\n[44] The courts in Rein, Daliberti, and\nPugh properly exercised personal jurisdiction\nover each of the defendants in those\ncases pursuant to the FSIA, which specifically\nprovides that personal jurisdiction exists\nwhere proper service and subject matter\njurisdiction have been established. 28\nU.S.C. § 1330(b); Rein, 995 F.Supp. at\n329–30; Daliberti, 97 F.Supp.2d at 52;\nPugh, 290 F.Supp.2d at 58. While the\nFSIA is not the basis for personal jurisdiction\nhere, jurisdiction based on the ATA or\nRule 4(k)(2) also requires minimum contacts\nwith the United States. Accordingly,\nPlaintiffs may rely on their ‘‘purposefully\ndirected’’ theory to establish these minimum\ncontacts. But as existed in Burger\nKing, Calder, and the three terrorism\ncases, Plaintiffs must allege some personal\nor direct involvement by the Defendants in\nthe conduct giving rise to their claims.\nSee, e.g., Daliberti, 97 F.Supp.2d at 41\n(explaining that defendant Iraq had held\nand tortured plaintiffs and that three of\nfour plaintiffs were released only after\nU.S. officials’ explicit negotiations with\ntheir Iraqi counterparts); Pugh, 290\nF.Supp.2d at 56 (noting that seven individual\nLibyan defendants were sued in the\nUnited States after extensive official\nFrench investigation and that these defendants\nwere deemed to be responsible for\nthe bombings in both civil and criminal\nproceedings); see also In re Magnetic Audiotape,\n334 F.3d at 208 (2d (stating a\n‘‘court may exercise personal jurisdiction\nover defendant consistent with due process\nwhen defendant is primary participant in\nintentional wrongdoing—albeit extraterritorially—expressly\ndirected at forum’’)\n(citing Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. at 789–90,\n104 S.Ct. 1482)); Time, Inc. v. Simpson,\nNo. 02 Civ. 4917(MBM), 2003 WL\n23018890, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2003)\n(finding Calder turned on ‘‘personal involvement\nof the individual defendants in\nthe particular conduct that gave rise to the\nplaintiff’s claim’’ and granting motion to\ndismiss because plaintiff had not demonstrated\nthat defendant had had any personal\ninvolvement in the events giving rise\nto the lawsuit). Accordingly, regardless of\nwhether personal jurisdiction is based on\nthe ATA’s nationwide service of process\nprovision or Rule 4(k)(2), to satisfy the\nFifth Amendment’s due process requirements,\nPlaintiffs must make a prima facie\nshowing of each Defendant’s personal or\ndirect participation in the conduct giving\nrise to Plaintiffs’ injuries.\n3. Mass Torts Theory\n[45] In addition to the arguments articulated\nabove, the Federal Plaintiffs submit\nthat the Court should utilize a modified\ndue process standard appropriate for\nmass torts. See, e.g., Federal Prince Turki\nOpp. at 23; Federal Prince Mohammed\nOpp. at 12; SAAR Network Opp. at 12–13.\nCourts in the Eastern District of New\nYork have outlined the modified standard\nin products liability cases as follows: the\nstate’s interests in the litigation replace\ncontacts with the forum as the constitutional\ntouchstone and the ‘‘reasonableness’’\ninquiry is replaced with a hardship analysis.\nSimon v. Philip Morris, 86 F.Supp.2d\n95, 129 (E.D.N.Y.2000); In re DES Cases,\n789 F.Supp. 552, 587 (E.D.N.Y.1992). The\n810 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nCourt declines to adopt this standard.\nThere was no question that, at a minimum,\nthe defendants in these products liability\nactions had substantial contacts with the\nforum, in these cases being New York, and\nwere involved in the sale or production of\nthe products at issue. In re DES Cases,\n789 F.Supp. at 559; Simon, 86 F.Supp.2d\nat 99–100. Here, however, there are questions\nas to the Defendants’ contacts with\nthe forum, whether it be the United States\ngenerally or New York specifically, and\nthe Defendants’ alleged involvement with\nal Qaeda is much more attenuated.\nB. Due Process Requirements\n[46–49] Any exercise of personal jurisdiction\nmust comport with the requirements\nof due process. ‘‘The due process\ntest for personal jurisdiction has two related\ncomponents: the ‘minimum contacts’\ninquiry and the ‘reasonableness’ inquiry.’’\nMetro. Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson–Ceco\nCorp., 84 F.3d 560, 567 (2d Cir.1996). Depending\non the basis for personal jurisdiction,\ndue process under either the Fifth or\nFourteenth Amendment applies. ‘‘[T]he\ndue process analysis is basically the same\nunder both the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments. The principal difference is\nthat under the Fifth Amendment the court\ncan consider the defendant’s contacts\nthroughout the United States, while under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment only the contacts\nwith the forum state may be considered.’’\nChew v. Dietrich, 143 F.3d 24, 28\nn. 4 (2d Cir.1998). Here, personal jurisdiction\nunder the New York long-arm statute\nrequires minimum contacts with New York\npursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe exercise of personal jurisdiction under\nRule 4(k) requires contacts with the United\nStates as a whole pursuant to the Fifth\nAmendment.\n1. Minimum Contacts\n[50, 51] Minimum contacts are required\nso ‘‘that the maintenance of the suit\ndoes not offend traditional notions of fair\nplay and substantial justice.’’ Int’l Shoe\nCo. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66\nS.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945); see also\nWorld–Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson,\n444 U.S. 286, 292, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62\nL.Ed.2d 490 (1980). The minimum contacts\nrequirement is also known as ‘‘fair\nwarning,’’ such that the defendant’s contacts\nwith the forum should be sufficient\nto make it reasonable to be haled into\ncourt there. Burger King, 471 U.S. at\n474, 105 S.Ct. 2174. The ‘‘ ‘fair warning’\nrequirement is satisfied if the defendant\nhas ‘purposefully directed’ his activities at\nthe residents of the forum TTT and the\nlitigation results from alleged injuries that\n‘arise out of or relate to’ those activities.’’\nId. (internal citations omitted); see also\nWorld–Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 297–\n98, 100 S.Ct. 559 (finding purposefully directed\nactivities where defendant delivered\nproducts into stream of commerce with expectation\nthey would be purchased by residents\nof forum); Calder, 465 U.S. at 789–\n90, 104 S.Ct. 1482 (finding publishing activities\noutside of forum were calculated to\ncause injury to plaintiff in forum where\nshe lived and which also had the highest\nsubscription rate). ‘‘Although it has been\nargued that foreseeability of causing injury\nin another State should be sufficient to\nestablish such contacts there when policy\nconsiderations so require, the Court has\nconsistently held that this kind of foreseeability\nis not a ‘sufficient benchmark’ for\nexercising personal jurisdiction.’’ Burger\nKing, 471 U.S. at 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174\n(quoting World–Wide Volkswagen, 444\nU.S. at 295, 100 S.Ct. 559). In every case,\nthere must be ‘‘some act by which the\ndefendant purposefully avails itself of the\nprivilege of conducting activities within the\nforum State, thus invoking the benefits\nand protections of its laws.’’ Id. (quoting\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n811\nHanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253, 78\nS.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958)).\n[52] For purposes of the minimum contacts\ninquiry, a distinction is made between\nspecific and general jurisdiction.\nSpecific jurisdiction exists when the forum\nexercises jurisdiction over the defendant in\na suit arising out of the defendant’s contacts\nwith that forum. Metro. Life Ins. 84\nF.3d at 567–68. General jurisdiction is\nbased on the defendant’s general business\ncontacts with the forum; because the defendant’s\ncontacts are not related to the\nsuit, a considerably higher level of contacts\nis generally required. 34 Id. at 568.\n2. Reasonableness\n[53] In determining whether the exercise\nof personal jurisdiction is reasonable,\na court is to consider:\n(1) the burden that the exercise of jurisdiction\nwill impose on the defendant; (2)\nthe interests in the forum state in adjudicating\nthe case; (3) the plaintiff’s interest\nin obtaining convenient and effective\nrelief; (4) the interstate judicial\nsystem’s interest in obtaining the most\nefficient resolution of the controversy;\nand (5) the shared interest of the states\nin furthering substantive social policies.\nMetro. Life, 84 F.3d at 568 (citing Asahi\nMetal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480\nU.S. 102, 113–16, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 94\nL.Ed.2d 92 (1987)). ‘‘These considerations\nsometimes serve to establish the reasonableness\nof jurisdiction upon a lesser showing\nof minimum contacts than would otherwise\nbe required.’’ Burger King, 471 U.S.\nat 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174.\n[54] There obviously are competing\npolicy considerations at play here. In general,\n‘‘ ‘great care and reserve should be\nexercised when extending our notions of\npersonal jurisdiction into the international\nfield.’ ’’ Asahi Metal Indus., 480 U.S. at\n115, 107 S.Ct. 1026 (quoting United States\nv.

On the\nother hand, ‘‘[t]here is some merit TTT to\nthe plaintiffs’ argument that no foreign\nterrorist today can fairly assert a lack of\n‘fair warning’ that it could be ‘haled into\ncourt’ in [this forum.]’’ Biton v. Palestinian\nInterim Self–Government, 310\nF.Supp.2d 172, 178 (D.D.C.2004).\nC. Jurisdictional Discovery\n[55, 56] Plaintiffs urge the Court to\ndeny Defendants’ motions and order jurisdictional\ndiscovery. In evaluating jurisdictional\nmotions, district courts enjoy broad\ndiscretion in deciding whether to order\ndiscovery. See, e.g., APWU v. Potter, 343\nF.3d 619, 627 (2d Cir.2003) (noting a court\nmay ‘‘devis[e] the procedures [to] ferret\nout the facts pertinent to jurisdiction’’);\nMarine Midland Bank, N.A. v. Miller, 664\nF.2d 899, 904 (2d Cir.1981) (noting a court\nhas considerable procedural leeway in deciding\nwhether discovery would assist resolution\nof motion to dismiss for lack of\npersonal jurisdiction); Lehigh Valley Indus.\nv. Birenbaum, 527 F.2d 87, 93–94 (2d\nCir.1975) (finding no abuse of discretion in\ndenying discovery where the complaint\nfailed to plead sufficient facts to establish\n34. At oral argument, Plaintiffs focused on\nspecific jurisdiction, see Oct. 12, 2004 Transcript\nat 44, but Plaintiffs include general\njurisdiction arguments in many of their opposition\nbriefs, see, e.g., Ashton Opp. to Prince\nMohamed at 22–24; Burnett Opp. to Aljomaih\nat 11. The Court considers all arguments.\n812 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\njurisdiction). ‘‘If a plaintiff has identified\na genuine issue of jurisdictional fact, jurisdictional\ndiscovery is appropriate even in\nthe absence of a prima facie showing as to\nthe existence of jurisdiction.’’ Daventree,\n349 F.Supp.2d 736 at 761, 2004 WL\n2997881, at *20 (citing In re Magnetic\nAudiotape, 334 F.3d at 207–08). Courts\nare not obligated to subject a foreign defendant\nto discovery, however, where the\nallegations of jurisdictional facts, construed\nin plaintiffs’ favor, fail to state a\nbasis for the exercise of jurisdiction or\nwhere discovery would not uncover sufficient\nfacts to sustain jurisdiction. Id. (citing\nJazini, 148 F.3d at 183–85 (granting\nmotion to dismiss and denying jurisdictional\ndiscovery where complaint was described\nas ‘‘sparse’’ and ‘‘conclusory’’)); see\nalso Cornell v.

Application of Plaintiffs’ Theories\nto Moving Defendants\n1. Prince Sultan\nThe Court outlined the allegations\nagainst Prince Sultan in Part I.B.1. With\nrespect to Prince Sultan’s contacts with\nthe United States, Plaintiffs allege that\n‘‘Saudi Royal family members own substantial\nassets in the United States of\nAmerica, and do substantial business in\nthe United States of America, the profits\nof which in part, are used to fund international\nterrorist acts, including those which\nled to the murderous attacks of September\n11, 2001.’’ See Ashton Complaint ¶ 296.\nThere is no indication of whether these\nunspecified members of the Royal family\ninclude Prince Sultan. Most Plaintiffs also\nclaim Prince Sultan is the ex-officio Chairman\nof the Board of Saudi Arabia Airlines,\n‘‘which does business in the United States\nand internationally.’’ Burnett Complaint\n¶ 340; Ashton Complaint ¶ 253; Barrera\nComplaint ¶ 255; Salvo Complaint ¶ 245;\nTremsky Complaint ¶ 180. The Federal\nPlaintiffs do not make a similar allegation.\n[57] To the extent these allegations are\nan attempt to establish general jurisdiction\nover Prince Sultan, they are insufficient.\nSee In re Baan Co. Sec. Litig., 245\nF.Supp.2d 117, 130 (D.D.C.2003) (refusing\nto hold that control status in foreign corporation\nwith United States office is sufficient\nfor personal jurisdiction over individual);\nCornell, 2000 WL 284222, at *2\n(granting motion to dismiss where complaint\ncontained one conclusory statement\nregarding jurisdiction); Family Internet,\nInc. v.

Plaintiffs’ Opp. at 23. Prince Sultan\nargues that his alleged actions cannot\nsatisfy the minimum contacts requirement\nsince the Second Circuit’s recent description\nof Calder requires ‘‘primary participa[tion]\nin intentional wrongdoing.’’ See\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n813\nIn re Magnetic Audiotape, 334 F.3d at\n208.\nJudge Robertson dismissed without\nprejudice the claims against Prince Sultan\nin his personal capacity for lack of personal\njurisdiction. Burnett II, 292 F.Supp.2d\nat 21–22. He rejected Plaintiffs’ argument\nthat Prince Sultan had purposefully directed\nhis alleged activities at the United\nStates. Id. at 22–23. Judge Robertson\nfound that the complaint’s claims that\nPrince Sultan donated money to foundations\nthat allegedly funded al Qaeda\n‘‘stop[ ] well short of alleging Prince Sultan’s\nactions were ‘expressly aimed’ or\n‘purposefully directed’ at the United\nStates.’’ Id. at 23 (citing Burger King and\nKeeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S.\n770, 774–75, 104 S.Ct. 1473, 79 L.Ed.2d 790\n(1984)). Judge Robertson also denied\nPlaintiffs’ request for discovery because\nthey did not provide an ‘‘outline of how\ntheir showing of minimum contacts might\nbe enhanced by jurisdictional discovery.’’\nId. at 22.\nThis Court’s record, which Plaintiffs\nclaim is more extensive than that before\nJudge Robertson, contains many examples\nof Osama bin Laden’s and al Qaeda’s public\ntargeting of the United States. See\nBierstein Aff. in Opp. to Prince Sultan’s\nMotion to Dismiss, Exs. 1–24. The complaints\nalso contain conclusory allegations\nthat Prince Sultan aided and abetted terrorism.\nSee, e.g., Burnett Complaint\n¶ 363; Federal Complaint ¶¶ 429–31. But\nPlaintiffs do not offer any facts to lend\nsupport to their allegation that Prince Sultan\npurposefully directed his activities at\nthis forum by donating to charities that he\nknew at the time supported international\nterrorism. See Exec. Order 13244 (designating\ncertain branches of Al Haramain in\n2002 and later). ‘‘[L]egal conclusions done\nup as factual allegations are not facts and\ncannot substitute for facts.’’ Cornell, 2000\nWL 284222, at *2 (citing Papasan v. Allain,\n478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92\nL.Ed.2d 209 (1986)). Plaintiffs have note\nprovided an ‘‘outline of how their showing\nof minimum contacts might be enhanced\nby jurisdictional discovery.’’ Burnett II\n292 F.Supp.2d at 22. Accordingly, Prince\nSultan’s motions to dismiss the certain\nconsolidated and Federal complaints for\nlack of personal jurisdiction over the\nclaims concerning his personal acts are\ngranted. Plaintiffs’ request for jurisdictional\ndiscovery with respect to Prince Sultan\nis denied. Daventree, 349 F.Supp.2d\n736, at 761, 2004 WL 2997881, at *20 (finding\njurisdictional discovery is not necessary\nwhere the allegation of jurisdictional\nfacts fails to state a basis for the exercise\nof personal jurisdiction).\n2. Prince Turki\n[59] The allegations against Prince\nTurki are outlined in Part I.B.2. Because\nthe consolidated Plaintiffs do not allege\nany acts taken by Prince Turki in his\npersonal capacity, the Court only considers\nthe Federal Plaintiffs’ claim that Prince\nTurki made personal donations to certain\nSaudi charities. See Federal Complaint\n¶ 452. The Federal complaint does not\nmake any specific jurisdictional allegations\nagainst Prince Turki. Rather, these Plaintiffs\nrely on Calder, Rein, Daliberti, Pugh,\nand the modified due process standard for\nmass torts to argue that the September 11\nattacks were a foreseeable result of Prince\nTurki’s alleged support of certain Saudi\ncharities. See Federal Opp. to Prince\nTurki’s Motion to Dismiss at 22–23.\nThe Federal Plaintiffs have not presented\nany specific facts from which this Court\ncould infer Prince Turki’s primary and\npersonal involvement in, or support of, international\nterrorism and al Qaeda. Conclusory\nallegations that he donated money\nto charities, without specific factual allega-\n814 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\ntions that he knew they were funneling\nmoney to terrorists, do not suffice. See\nBurnett II, 292 F.Supp.2d at 23 (citing\nBurger King and Keeton v. Hustler Magazine,\nInc., 465 U.S. at 774–75, 104 S.Ct.\n1473); see also Exec. Order 13244 (designating\ncertain branches of Al Haramain\nand BIF in 2002). Accordingly, Prince\nTurki’s motion to dismiss the Federal complaint\nfor lack of personal jurisdiction is\ngranted. Jurisdictional discovery is not\nappropriate with respect to Prince Turki\nbecause Plaintiffs have not identified any\ngenuine issue of jurisdictional fact. Daventree,\n349 F.Supp.2d 736, at 761, 2004\nWL 2997881, at *20.\n3. Prince Mohamed\nThe Ashton and Federal Plaintiffs allege\nthat Prince Mohamed is or was the chairman\nor chief executive officer of three\nfinancial institutions in Saudi Arabia: Dar\nal Maal al Islami (‘‘DMI’’), Islamic Investment\nCompany of the Gulf–Bahrain EC\n(‘‘IICG’’), and Faisal Islamic Bank–Sudan\n(‘‘FIBS’’), which are all shareholders of\nDefendant Al Shamal Islamic Bank. 35 Ashton\nComplaint ¶¶ 51, 54; Federal Complaint\n¶¶ 307, 309, 473. They claim that\nPrince Mohamed knew or should have\nknown that each of these financial institutions\n‘‘acted as an aider and abettor and\nmaterial sponsor of al Qaeda, Bin Laden,\nand international terrorism.’’ Ashton Complaint\n¶ 276; Federal Complaint ¶ 472 (alleging\nPrince Mohamed ‘‘has long provided\nmaterial support and resources to al Qaeda’’).\nThe Ashton Plaintiffs claim that\nPrince Mohamed is ‘‘heavily involved in\nthe sponsorship of terror through Faisal\nIslamic Bank–Sudan,’’ since at some point\nal Qaeda allegedly had an account there.\nAshton Complaint ¶¶ 65, 66, 255, 274; see\nalso Ashton Opp. to Prince Mohamed’s\nMotion to Dismiss at 25 (arguing that al\nQaeda operative Jamal Ahmed Al Fadl\nused an account at Al Shamal Islamic\nBank to transfer $250,000 for Osama bin\nLaden). These Plaintiffs also claim that\nPrince Mohamed has financial ties with\nalleged al Qaeda financier Muhammed\nZouaydi. Ashton Complaint ¶ 258. The\nFederal Plaintiffs claim that Prince Mohamed\nmade personal contributions to Saudi-based\ncharities that he knew or should\nhave known sponsored the terrorist activities\nof al Qaeda. These charities include\nIIRO, MWL, WAMY, BIF, the Saudi High\nCommission, SJRC, and Al Haramain.\nFederal Complaint ¶¶ 475–76\nThe Ashton complaint contains an unspecific\nallegation regarding the Saudi\nRoyal family’s ownership of property in\nthe United States. Ashton Complaint\n¶ 296. The Ashton Plaintiffs argue that\ngeneral jurisdiction is appropriate because\nPrince Mohamed attended college and\nbusiness school in the United States, gave\ntwo interviews in a New York apartment\nin 1978, gave a speech at Harvard in 1999,\nand made investments in American businesses\nthrough the banks he chairs in\n2001. Ashton Opp. to Prince Mohamed\nMotion to Dismiss at 22–23. Plaintiffs assert\njurisdictional discovery is likely to\nexpose further contacts between Prince\nMohamed and the United States.\nIf general jurisdiction is not established\nthrough Prince Mohamed’s contacts with\nthe United States, the Ashton and Federal\nPlaintiffs claim that jurisdiction exists under\neither the New York long-arm conspiracy\ntheory or the purposefully directed\nactivities theory.

Ashton Opp. at 25.\nFinally, Plaintiffs allege the that attacks in\nquestion caused many deaths, a fact that\nno one disputes. Ashton Complaint ¶¶ 23,\n610.\nIn response, Prince Mohamed argues\nthat Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate\nthat he is ‘‘present’’ in the United States\nfor general personal jurisdiction purposes.\nSee Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia,\nS.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 411–12, 416–18,\n104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984);\nBersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., 519 F.2d\n974, 998 (2d Cir.1975) (buying and selling\nAmerican securities is insufficient to establish\nthat defendant was ‘‘doing business’’ in\nthe United States). Prince Mohamed submits\nthat some of the contacts on which\nPlaintiffs rely are too far removed in time\nfrom September 2001 to be considered by\nthe Court. See Metro. Life, 84 F.3d at 569\n(holding courts should examine a defendant’s\ncontacts with the forum for a reasonable\nperiod prior to the date on which\nthe lawsuit was filed, and finding that six\n816 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nyears was reasonable). Prince Mohamed\ncorrectly submits that his position as an\nofficer of DMI, IICG, and FIBS would not\nbe a basis for jurisdiction over him even if\nthe Court had personal jurisdiction over\nthese entities. See Keeton v. Hustler\nMagazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 781 n. 13,\n104 S.Ct. 1473, 79 L.Ed.2d 790 (1984)\n(‘‘Each defendant’s contacts with the forum\nState must be assessed individually.’’).\nFinally, Prince Mohamed argues that the\nconclusory allegation that he participated\nin a terrorist conspiracy, without specific\nfacts, is insufficient to create personal jurisdiction\nover him.\n[60] The Court agrees that Plaintiffs\nhave not presented a prima facie case of\ngeneral jurisdiction over Prince Mohamed.\nIn the ten years before the attacks, Prince\nMohamed’s contacts with the United\nStates consist of one speech and a handful\nof investments in the United States\nthrough the banks with which he is affiliated.\nThese contacts are not sufficiently\n‘‘systematic and continuous’’ to maintain\ngeneral jurisdiction over a defendant in\nthis action. 36 See Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at\n416, 104 S.Ct. 1868 (holding that purchasing\nin forum, sending personnel for training\nin forum, and negotiating a contract in\nforum were not sufficient to establish general\njurisdiction).\n[61, 62] Plaintiffs have alleged that\nDMI and FIBS might have been involved\nin the financing of terrorism. See, e.g.,\nAshton Complaint ¶¶ 274–75; Ashton Opp.\nat 25. Even assuming that the Court has\npersonal jurisdiction over these entities,\n‘‘[t]he mere fact that a corporation is subject\nto jurisdiction TTT does not mean that\nindividual officer may be hauled before\nNew York courts without any showing that\nthe individuals themselves maintained a\n36. There is no allegation that Prince Mohamed’s\ninvestments in the United States are\npresence or conducted business in New\nYork.’’ Family Internet, 1999 WL 796177,\nat *4. Plaintiffs have not alleged that\nPrince Mohamed had any knowledge or\ninvolvement in any al Qaeda accounts at\nany of the banks he chaired. FIBS’ relationship\nwith Al Shamal Islamic Bank,\nwhich purportedly knowingly opened accounts\nfor al Qaeda operatives, including\nOsama bin Laden, is too remote in time\nand proximity to implicate Prince Mohamed.\nTo make a prima facie case of\npersonal jurisdiction, Plaintiffs must either\nallege personal acts by Prince Mohamed\nby which he purposefully directed his activities\nat the United States by supporting\nOsama bin Laden, al Qaeda, or their terrorist\nagenda, or demonstrate that the acts\nof the banks he chaired can be imputed to\nhim. Plaintiffs have not met their burden.\nThus, Prince Mohamed’s motions to dismiss\nthe Ashton and Federal complaints as\nagainst him for lack of personal jurisdiction\nare granted.\n4. Estate of Mohammad Abdullah\nAljomaih\nOn May 2, 2003 by Second Addition and\nRemoval of Defendants Pursuant to Case\nManagement Order No. 1 imposed by\nJudge Robertson, the Burnett Plaintiffs\nadded a defendant ‘‘Mohammed Bin Abdullah\nAl–Jomaith.’’ To date, no specific\nallegations have been added to the complaint\nwith respect to Mr. Aljomaih.\nIn anticipation of what the claims\nagainst him might be, before his death Mr.\nAljomaih prepared a declaration in support\nof his motion to dismiss. He was born in\nSaudi Arabia in 1915 and lived in Riyadh\nfor most of his life. Aljomaih Decl. ¶ 3. He\nand his family began a company in the\n1940s that now supplies automobiles, soft\ndrinks, construction equipment, and other\nrelated to any alleged conspiracy or to al\nQaeda’s activities.\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n817\ngoods and services to large portions of\nSaudi Arabia. Id. ¶ 4. In the past ten\nyears he visited the United States three\ntimes for medical reasons. Id. ¶¶ 5–6.\nPrior to these medical visits, he took a\nshort trip to New York City in 1964. Id.\n¶ 7. He owned no property, held no bank\naccounts, and conducted no business in\nthis country. Id. ¶ 10.\nMr. Aljomaih’s estate argues that there\nwere problems with his service. He was\nserved pursuant to Judge Robertson’s\nMarch 25, 2003 approving service by publication.\nUnder that order, Plaintiffs published\na list of defendants in two publications,\nThe International Herald Tribune\nand Al Quds Al Arabia. The notice in The\nInternational Herald Tribune contained\nMr. Aljomaih’s name in English, a language\nhe could not read. Id. ¶ 11. Al\nQuds Al Arabi is published in Arabic, but\nis not circulated in Saudi Arabia and the\nlist did not include Mr. Aljomaih’s name.\nEven if service was proper, however, the\nestate of Mr. Aljomaih claims the Court\ndoes not have personal jurisdiction over it.\nPlaintiffs submit that Mr. Aljomaih is\nimplicated by the ‘‘Golden Chain.’’ Plaintiffs’\nOpp. at 9. The ‘‘Golden Chain’’ is a\ngroup of documents that was discovered\nby Bosnian authorities searching the offices\nof charity Defendant BIF in March\n2002. Plaintiffs claim the ‘‘Golden Chain’’\ncontains a list of early direct donors to al\nQaeda. Plaintiffs’ Opp. at 9; see also Bierstein\nAff. in Opp. to Al–Husani Motion\nto Dismiss, Ex. 2 (‘‘Golden Chain’’ document).\nIt includes the entry ‘‘Al–Jumaih.\nJeddah (S.A.).’’ Plaintiffs do not dispute\nthat ‘‘for more than sixty years [Mr. Aljomaih]\nlived in Rihadh,’’ not Jeddah, Aljomaih\nDecl. ¶ 3, yet they insist the document\nidentifies him as a direct donor to al\nQaeda. Additionally, Plaintiffs claim that\nMr. Aljomaih’s company donated money to\ncharity Defendant IIRO. Plaintiffs assert\nthere are sufficient allegations against Mr.\nAljomaih in the form of general allegations\nagainst all Defendants to put him on notice\nof the claims against him. They claim that\njurisdiction over Mr. Aljomaih’s estate is\nproper because he ‘‘purposefully directed’’\nhis activities at the United States by supporting\nal Qaeda. Plaintiffs also submit\nthat Mr. Aljomaih’s company does business\nwith General Motors and Shell Corporation\nand that, therefore, he must have\nhad contacts with the United States. See\nOpp. at 11; Statement of Jamie L. Paye\nattached to Plaintiffs’ Opp.\n[63] The Court finds the Plaintiffs\nhave not established a prima facie case of\njurisdiction over Mr. Aljomaih to defeat\nhis motion or warrant jurisdictional discovery.\nTheir theory of jurisdiction rests almost\nentirely on a document with serious\nfoundational flaws. Even assuming, as the\nCourt must, that the ‘‘Golden Chain’’ refers\nto Mr. Aljomaih, with no indication of\nwho wrote the list, when it was written, or\nfor what purpose, the Court cannot make\nthe logical leap that the document is a list\nof early al Qaeda supporters. Mr. Aljomaih’s\nmotion to dismiss the Burnett complaint\nfor lack of personal jurisdiction is\naccordingly granted.\n5. Sheikh Hamad Al–Husani\nThe posture of the Burnett Plaintiffs’\ncase against Sheikh Hamad Al–Husani is\nsimilar to that against Mr. Aljomaih. Mr.\nAl–Husani was also added to a list of\ndefendants to be served by publication and\nthe complaint contains no specific allegations\nagainst him. Al–Husani Decl. ¶ 10.\nHe is a watch retailer residing in Saudi\nArabia. Id. ¶¶ 3–4, 7. Mr. Al–Husani has\nnever visited the United States, owns no\nreal property here, holds no bank accounts\nor investments in the United States, and\ndoes not engage in transactions with any\nbusinesses in the United States. Id. ¶¶ 3,\n818 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n5–7. He has never supported any person\nor organization that he has known to participate\nin any terrorist attacks. Id. ¶ 9.\nMr. Al–Husani submits that Plaintiffs cannot\ncure the lack of allegations in the\ncomplaint in its motion papers. Wright v.\nErnst & Young, LLP, 152 F.3d 169, 178\n(2d Cir.1998) (explaining a party is not\npermitted to amend its complaint through\nallegations made in motion papers).\nMr. Al–Husani also claims that he was\nnot properly served because The International\nHerald Tribune has a circulation of\nonly 199 in Saudi Arabia and is published\nin English, and Al Quds Al Arabia is a\nLondon-based paper banned in the Kingdom.\nEven if service was proper, however,\nMr. Al–Husani submits this Court does\nnot have personal jurisdiction over him.\nThe Burnett Plaintiffs claim that Mr.\nAl–Husani is also implicated by the ‘‘Golden\nChain,’’ and thus an early supporter of\nal Qaeda. Plaintiffs’ Opp. to Al–Husani\nMotion to Dismiss at 10; Bierstein Aff. at\nEx. 2 (document listing ‘‘Hamad Al Husaini,’’\nwithout indicating when list was written,\nby whom, or for what purpose). The\nPlaintiffs place great weight on the United\nStates’ inclusion of the ‘‘Golden Chain’’ in\nits proffer of evidence in United States v.\nArnaout, the government’s case against an\nexecutive of Defendant charity BIF. See\nBierstein Aff. at Ex. 1 (proffer). The\ncourt presiding over that case, however,\nruled that the document was inadmissible\nhearsay. United States v. Arnaout, No.\n02 Cr. 892, 2003 WL 255226, at *1–2\n(N.D.Ill. Feb. 4, 2003). Nevertheless, by\nsupporting al Qaeda, Plaintiffs assert Mr.\nAl–Husani purposefully directed his activities\ntoward the United States, making the\nexercise of personal jurisdiction appropriate.\nSee, e.g. Bierstein Aff. Exs. 9–15\n(detailing al Qaeda’s hatred for and actions\nagainst the United States). Additionally,\nPlaintiffs claim that one of Mr. Al–Husani’s\ncompanies is a supporter of Al–Waqf\nal-Islami Foundation, a Dutch entity whose\nseminars ‘‘have drilled extremist messages\ninto the heads of thousands of young Muslims.’’\n‘‘Radical Foundation: In ‘Law’\nSeminars, A Saudi Group Spreads Extremism,’’\nWall St. J., Apr. 15, 2003, at\nBierstein Aff. Ex. 6.\n[64] Plaintiffs have not established a\nprima facie showing of jurisdiction over\nMr. Al–Husani to survive his motion to\ndismiss or warrant jurisdictional discovery.\nThe ‘‘Golden Chain’’ does not say what the\nPlaintiffs argue it says. It is only a list of\nnames found in a charity’s office. It does\nnot establish Mr. Aljomaih’s involvement\nin a terrorist conspiracy culminating in the\nSeptember 11 attacks and it does not demonstrate\nthat he purposefully directed his\nactivities at the United States. Accordingly,\nMr. Al–Husani’s motion to dismiss the\nBurnett complaint against him is granted.\n6. NCB\nThe Court outlined the Ashton and Burnett\nPlaintiffs’ claims against NCB in Part\nI.B.4. For purposes of the personal jurisdiction\nanalysis, the Court will assume at\nthis point that the FSIA does not provide\nfor subject matter and personal jurisdiction\nover NCB. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs\nwill have to make a prima facie showing to\nsurvive NCB’s motion to dismiss. In that\nvein, Plaintiffs argue that NCB purposefully\ndirected its activities at the United\nStates and participated in a conspiracy\nthat culminated in the attacks of September\n11.\nPlaintiffs submit NCB has many contacts\nwith the United States, including a\nwholly-owned subsidiary in New York City\nthrough which it operates an international\nbanking business. See, e.g., Aff. of John\nFawcett in Support of Ashton Plaintiffs’\nOpp. to NCB’s Motion to Dismiss (hereinafter\n‘‘Fawcett Aff.’’) ¶ 3, Exs. 2 & 3.

However,\nwhen they are examined as a whole—\nthe presence of a branch office until 1992,\na subsidiary until 2001, taking advantage\nof the privilege of its presence in New\nYork by instigating a lawsuit in this forum,\nadvertisements in U.S. publications—the\nCourt finds that they may, with the help of\nlimited jurisdictional discovery, comport\nwith due process.

At this stage, the\nCourt must accept as true Plaintiffs’ contentions\nthat SBG still contains Osama bin\nLaden’s name in its corporate documents.\nAshton Complaint ¶ 558; Burnett Complaint\n¶ 329. Additionally, although it\nwould not satisfy the due process requisites\non its own, SBG’s presence in Maryland\nthree years before the complaints\nwere filed, also warrants some discovery.\nAccordingly, SBG’s motion to dismiss the\nAshton and Burnett complaints are denied\nwithout prejudice.\n9. SAAR Network\nThe Federal Plaintiffs claim the SAAR\nNetwork is a network of ‘‘interrelated ostensible\ncharities’’ that was established in\nthe 1980s ‘‘to generate and surreptitiously\ntransfer funds to terrorist organizations,\nincluding al-Qaeda.’’ Federal Complaint\n¶ 222. Several organizations within the\nSAAR Network, including SAAR Foundation,\nSAAR International, Safa Group,\nMar–Jac Poultry, Mar–Jac Holdings, Inc.,\nSafa Trust, Inc. and Aradi, Inc., were established,\nfunded or closely affiliated with\nDefendant Suleiman Abdul Aziz al Rajhi.\nId. at ¶ 223. By September 11, 2001, there\nwere allegedly over one hundred entities in\nthis network, ‘‘including the U.S. branches\nof MWL, IIRO and WAMY, [and the\nSAAR Network Defendants moving to dismiss\nhere,] African Muslim Agency, Grove\nCorporate, Inc., Heritage Education Trust,\nInternational Institute of Islamic Thought,\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n823\nMar–Jac Investment, Inc., Mena Corporation,\nReston Investment, Inc., Sterling\nCharitable Gift Fund, Sterling Management\nGroup, Inc., Success Foundation, and\nYork Foundation.’’ Id. ¶ 224. Allegedly,\nmany of the entities are related by common\nmanagement, few of them maintained\na physical presence at their purported\nplace of business, and they all ‘‘have long\nacted as fully integrated components of al\nQaeda’s logistical and financial support infrastructure.’’\nId. ¶¶ 225, 226.\nPlaintiffs argue the Court has personal\njurisdiction over the SAAR Network because\nit participated in the conspiracy that\nresulted in catastrophic effects in this district.\nAfter an ongoing investigation in\nthe Eastern District of Virginia, federal\nauthorities raided the offices of several of\nthese Defendants in Herndon, Virginia in\nMarch 2002. Id. ¶ 227. The investigation\nhas allegedly revealed that SAAR Network\nfunds have been transferred to designated\nterrorists and al Qaeda operatives\nYoussef Nada and Ahmed Idris Nasreddin.\nId. ¶ 228; see Exec. Order No. 13224\n(designating individuals as terrorists).\nAdditionally, Plaintiffs claim that the investigation\nhas revealed that SAAR Network\nentities have engaged in transactions\nwith Bait Ul-mal, Inc. (BMI), which has\ntransferred funds to terrorist organizations\nincluding al Qaeda, and materially\nsupported the 1998 embassy bombings in\nAfrica. Federal Complaint ¶¶ 229–230.\n[69] At this stage, the Court must accept\nas true Plaintiffs’ allegations concerning\nthe relationships of the SAAR\nNetwork. Id. ¶¶ 222, 226. Defendants\ncorrectly argue, however, that Defendants\nhave provided scant basis for linking\nthese entities under the SAAR Network\ntitle. Certain of these groups may be\nsubject to personal jurisdiction in light of\nPlaintiffs’ allegation that they purposefully\ndirecting its activities at the United\nStates by transferring money to designated\nterrorists Youssef Nada and Ahmed\nIdris Nasreddin, particularly if they intended\nthe money to support terrorism.\nId. ¶ 228. Additionally, general jurisdiction\ncould be appropriate for the SAAR\nNetwork entities having offices in Virginia.\nId. ¶ 227. Accordingly, the SAAR\nNetwork’s motion to dismiss is denied\nwithout prejudice. The parties are to engage\nin jurisdictional discovery to determine\nwhich of the Network’s entities have\na presence in Virginia and which entities\ntransferred money to Nada and Nasreddin.\n10. Adel A.J. Batterjee\nThe Burnett Plaintiffs claim that Defendant\nAdel A.J. Batterjee is an associate of\nOsama bin Laden. Burnett Complaint\n¶ 181. On December 21, 2004, the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury designated Mr.\nBatterjee as a Specially Designated Global\nTerrorist. See Dec. 23, 2004 Bierstein letter\nto Court; Exec. Order No. 13224. Mr.\nBatterjee is the chairman of Al Shamal\nIslamic Bank, ‘‘an instrumental bank in\nOsama bin Laden’s financial support network.’’\nBurnett Complaint ¶ 365. Mr.\nBatterjee is also chairman of al-Bir Saudi\nOrganization, whose United States branch,\nDefendant BIF, is allegedly a ‘‘front for al\nQaeda sponsorship.’’ Burnett Complaint\n¶¶ 75, 196, 199. BIF is also a designated\nterrorist organization. See Exec. Order\nNo. 13224. The Saudi government closed\nAl–Bir in 1993 ‘‘at the same time it was\nclosing other organizations for ties to terrorism.’’\nBurnett Complaint ¶ 183. Mr.\nBatterjee then allegedly moved the charity’s\nheadquarters to Chicago in the name\nof BIF. Id. ¶ 183. Mr. Batterjee is listed\nas one of BIF’s three founders in its articles\nof incorporation filed in Illinois. Id.\n¶ 183. Through an alias, Mr. Batterjee\nallegedly sent money to BIF’s branches.\n824 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nId. ¶ 184; see also Decl. of Jodi Westbrook\nFlowers in Opp. to Batterjee Motion to\nDismiss (‘‘Flowers Decl.’’) Att. 5, p. 7 (BIF\nrecord showing $48,464 contribution by\nAbdel Abdul Jalil Batterjee). Mr. Batterjee\nallegedly transferred control of BIF to\nDefendant Enaam M. Arnaout, on September\n15, 1997. 38 Burnett Complaint ¶ 183.\nIn October 2001, Arnaout allegedly told\nBatterjee he was worried about being under\nscrutiny of the U.S. government and in\nJanuary 2002, Batterjee requested that\nAranout relocate his family to Saudi Arabia.\nId. ¶¶ 217–218. Plaintiffs also claim\nthat Mr. Batterjee’s name is on a BIF list\nof wealthy Saudi Arabian sponsors of al\nQaeda and Osama bin Laden. Id. ¶ 219.\nPlaintiffs also claim that Defendant\ncharity WAMY and BIF are closely connected\nand that Mr. Batterjee was the\nSecretary General of WAMY when he\nfounded BIF in the United States. Id.\n¶ 229; see also Flowers Decl. Att. 4, p. 3\n(December 5, 1992 New York Times article\nquoting Adel A. Batterjee as the chairman\nof WAMY). In his capacity as Secretary\nGeneral of WAMY, Mr. Batterjee allegedly\ncommissioned a biography of Osama bin\nLaden and the origins of al Qaeda, which\nwas jointly published by WAMY and BIF\nin 1991. Burnett Complaint ¶ 230.\nWith respect to his contacts with the\nUnited States, Plaintiffs claim that the\ndocuments filed in 1992 in conjunction with\nthe establishment of BIF in Chicago state\nthat Mr. Batterjee is a founder of BIF and\nthat BIF’s founders travel to the United\nStates on a regular basis. See Flowers\n38. Mr. Arnaout was ‘‘criminally indicted for\nhis role in the September 11, 2001 attacks.’’\nBurnett Complaint ¶ 199. But in its ‘‘written\nplea agreement, the government agreed to\ndismiss sensational and highly publicized\ncharges of providing material support to terrorists\nand terrorist organizations.’’ United\nStates v. Arnaout, 282 F.Supp.2d 838, 843\n(N.D.Ill.2003). The Burnett Plaintiffs allege\nDecl. Att. 2, pp. 2–3. In 1993 BIF filed an\napplication to conduct business in Florida\nand listed Mr. Batterjee as a director with\nan address in Florida. See id. at Att. 3, p.\n4. BIF’s authorization to do business in\nFlorida was revoked on August 26, 1994.\nId. at p. 1.\nMr. Batterjee disputes the claims\nagainst him in a declaration filed in conjunction\nwith his motion to dismiss. Batterjee\nDecl. ¶ 8. He states he was born in\nSaudi Arabia, attended college in the United\nStates in the 1960s, and returned to\nSaudi Arabia. Id. ¶¶ 3, 5. He claims he\nwas last in the United States in June 2000\nfor personal reasons. Id. ¶ 5. He denies\nowning any real property, bank accounts,\nor investments in the United States. Id.\n¶ 6. With respect to the allegations contained\nin the complaint, Mr. Batterjee\nclaims BIF was never a branch of Al Bir\nor vice versa. Id. ¶ 9. He claims he never\nsent money to BIF in all of its history. Id.\nHe states he transferred away all control\nof BIF in 1993. Id. He claims he never\nserved as an executive of WAMY, never\nwrote a biography of Osama bin Laden,\nand denies having any knowledge of Osama\nbin Laden’s or al Qaeda’s activities\nother than what is widely published in the\npress. Id. ¶¶ 9, 10.\nMr. Batterjee also disputes the manner\nin which he was served. Plaintiffs reasoned\nthat Al–Quds Al–Arabia had published\nOsama bin Laden’s fatwas in the\npast and could, therefore, reach his supporters\nregardless of their location. Further,\nThe International Herald Tribune is\nMr. Arnaout and Osama bin Laden have ties.\nFor example, law enforcement officials in\nBosnia–Herzegovina raided BIF’s offices in\nMarch 2002 and allegedly recovered documents\nestablishing direct communications between\nMr. Arnaout and Osama bin Laden in\nthe late 1980s and early 1990s. Burnett Complaint\n¶¶ 188, 196, 199.\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n825\navailable to the world community. Additionally,\nPlaintiffs submit that these cases\nhave been widely reported in the Arabic\nmedia and the complaints have been available\non numerous websites for over two\nyears. In light of these considerations and\nJudge Robertson’s March 23, 2003 order\napproving service by publication for Defendants\nincluding Mr. Batterjee, the\nCourt denies Mr. Batterjee’s motion to\nquash service.\n[70] The Court finds the Burnett\nPlaintiffs made a prima facie showing of\npersonal jurisdiction over Mr. Batterjee.\nWhile perhaps not dispositive on its own,\nMr. Batterjee’s designation as a terrorist\nlends substantial weight to Plaintiffs’\nclaims that he purposefully directed his\nactivities at the United States and that the\nexercise of personal jurisdiction over him\ncomports with due process. See Biton,\n310 F.Supp.2d at 178. Mr. Batterjee purportedly\ncommissioned a book about al\nQaeda and Osama bin Laden. He is the\nchairman of Al Shamal Islamic Bank, a\nbank with admitted and substantial ties to\nOsama bin Laden. Burnett Complaint\n¶¶ 70, 79. Additionally, he is involved in\nthe United States operations of designated\nterrorist, BIF. In the ten years leading up\nto the commencement of this action, Mr.\nBatterjee has had contacts with the United\nStates that could be related to the terrorist\nattacks inasmuch as BIF participated in\nthose attacks. Specifically, Mr. Batterjee\ntraveled to Chicago for BIF and had an\naddress in Florida for BIF. Accordingly,\nMr. Batterjee’s motion to dismiss the Burnett\ncomplaint for lack of personal jurisdiction\nis denied.\nIII. Failure to State a Claim\nIn considering Defendants’ motions to\ndismiss for failure to state a claim under\nRule 12(b)(6), the Court must ‘‘accept all of\nPlaintiffs’ factual allegations in the complaint\nas true and draw inferences from\nthose allegations in the light most favorable\nto the Plaintiffs.’’ Desiderio v. Nat’l\nAss’n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., 191 F.3d 198,\n202 (2d Cir.1999). Dismissal is not appropriate\nunless it appears beyond doubt,\n‘‘even when the complaint is liberally construed,\nthat the plaintiff can prove no set\nof facts which would entitle him to relief.’’\nId.; Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45–46,\n78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that\na complaint contain ‘‘a short and plain\nstatement of the claim showing that the\npleader is entitled to relief.’’ Fed.R.Civ.P.\n8(a)(2). The Supreme Court reinforced\nthese liberal pleading standards in Swierkiewicz\nv. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 512,\n122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002) (observing\nthe ‘‘short and plain statement’’\nrequired by Rule 8 ‘‘must simply ‘give the\ndefendant fair notice of what the plaintiff’s\nclaim is and the grounds upon which it\nrests’ ’’) (quoting Conley, 355 U.S. at 47, 78\nS.Ct. 99). When presented with a 12(b)(6)\nmotion, the district court may not consider\nmatters outside of the pleadings without\nconverting the motion into a motion for\nsummary judgment. Courtenay Communications\nCorp. v. Hall, 334 F.3d 210, 213\n(2d Cir.2003); Friedl v. City of New York,\n210 F.3d 79, 83–84 (2d Cir.2000).\nA. Elements of Claims\n[71] Plaintiffs claim that each Defendant\nprovided material support to the al\nQaeda terrorists who perpetrated the attacks\non September 11, 2001. Under the\nATA, material support includes money, financial\nservices, lodging, training, safehouses,\nand false documentation or identification.\n18 U.S.C. §§ 2339A(b), 2339B(g).\nAssuming such support is alleged, Plaintiffs\nwill have to present a sufficient causal\nconnection between that support and the\ninjuries suffered by Plaintiffs. See Bur-\n826 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at 104. Proximate\ncause will support this connection. See\nFirst Nationwide Bank v. Gelt Funding\nCorp., 27 F.3d 763, 769 (2d Cir.1994)\n(‘‘Central to the notion of proximate cause\nis the idea that a person is not liable to all\nthose who may have been injured by his\nconduct, but only to those with respect to\nwhom his acts were a substantial factor in\nthe sequence of responsible causation, and\nwhose injury was reasonably foreseeable\nor anticipated as a natural consequence.’’).\nIn light of al Qaeda’s public acknowledgments\nof its war against the United States,\nthe September 11 attacks may be the natural\nand probable consequence of knowingly\nand intentionally providing material support\nto al Qaeda. Burnett I, 274\nF.Supp.2d at 104.\n[72] Plaintiffs rely on theories of concerted\naction liability—conspiracy and aiding\nand abetting—in support of this causal\nlink. ‘‘Concerted action liability under\nNew York law is based on the principle\nthat ‘[a]ll those who, in pursuance of a\ncommon plan or design to commit a tortious\nact, actively take part in it, or further\nit by cooperation or request, or who lend\naid or encouragement to the wrongdoer\nTTT are equally liable with him.’ ’’ Pittman,\n149 F.3d at 122 (quoting Bichler v.\nEli Lilly & Co., 55 N.Y.2d 571, 580, 450\nN.Y.S.2d 776, 436 N.E.2d 182 (1982)). To\nbe liable under either conspiracy or aiding\nand abetting, however, the defendant\n‘‘must know the wrongful nature of the\nprimary actor’s conduct,’’ id. at 123, and\nthe conduct must be tied to a substantive\ncause of action, Chrysler Capital Corp.,\n778 F.Supp. at 1267. In this regard, Plaintiffs\nrely on the ATCA, RICO, the TVPA,\nthe ATA, and various state laws, including\nwrongful death, survival, intentional infliction\nof emotional distress, trespass, assault\nand battery, negligence, and negligent infliction\nof emotional distress.\n1. ATCA\n[73] The Alien Tort Claims Act provides\nthat ‘‘[t]he district courts shall have\noriginal jurisdiction of any civil action by\nan alien for a tort only, committed in violation\nof the law of nations or a treaty of the\nUnited States.’’ 28 U.S.C. § 1350. ‘‘This\nstatute confers subject matter jurisdiction\nwhen the following three conditions are\nsatisfied: (1) an alien sues (2) for a tort (3)\ncommitted in violation of the law of nations\n(i.e., international law).’’ Kadic v. Karadzic,\n70 F.3d 232, 238 (2d Cir.1995); see\nalso Flores v. Southern Peru Corp., 343\nF.3d 140, 143 n. 2 (2d Cir.2003). Certain\nPlaintiffs in these actions are aliens and\nthe complaints all allege common law torts.\nThe Court finds that ‘‘aircraft hijacking is\ngenerally recognized as a violation of international\nlaw.’’ Burnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at\n100 (citing Kadic, 70 F.3d at 240; Bigio v.\nCoca–Cola Co., 239 F.3d 440, 447–49 (2d\nCir.2000)). Further, ‘‘courts, including the\nSecond Circuit, have almost unanimously\npermitted actions premised on a theory of\naiding and abetting and conspiracy.’’\nPresbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman\nEnergy, Inc., 244 F.Supp.2d 289, 311\n(S.D.N.Y.2003). Accordingly, the ATCA\nmay provide a basis for a concerted action\nclaim of material support by alien-Plaintiffs\nhere. See Burnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at\n100.\n2. RICO\n‘‘To state a claim under civil RICO, a\nplaintiff must plead seven elements: (1)\nthat the defendant (2) through the commission\nof two or more acts (3) constituting a\n‘pattern’ (4) of ‘racketeering activity’ (5)\ndirectly or indirectly invests in, maintains\nan interest in, or participates in (6) an\n‘enterprise’ (7) the activities of which affect\ninterstate or foreign commerce.’’ Berk v.\nTradewell, Inc., Nos. 01 Civ. 9035, 01 Civ.\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n827\n10068(MBM), 2003 WL 21664679, at *11\n(S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2003) (quoting Moss v.\nMorgan Stanley, Inc., 719 F.2d 5, 17 (2d\nCir.1983)); see also 18 U.S.C. § 1962.\n‘‘Civil RICO is an unusually potent weapon\nTTT ‘courts should strive to flush out frivolous\nRICO allegations at an early stage of\nthe litigation.’ ’’ Katzman v. Victoria’s Secret,\n167 F.R.D. 649, 655 (S.D.N.Y.1996).\n[74] The Federal complaint asserts a\nRICO claim under § 1962(a), which states\nin part: ‘‘It shall be unlawful for any person\nwho has received any income derived,\ndirectly or indirectly, from a pattern of\nracketeering activity or through collection\nof an unlawful debt in which such person\nhas participated a principal within the\nmeaning of 18 U.S.C. § 2, to use or invest,\ndirectly or indirectly, any part of such\nincome, or the proceeds of such income, in\nacquisition of any interest in, or the establishment\nor operation of, any enterprise\nwhich is engaged in, or the activities of\nwhich affect, interstate or foreign commerce.’’\n18 U.S.C. § 1962(a). ‘‘Because\nthe conduct constituting a violation of\n§ 1962(a) is investment of racketeering income,\na plaintiff must allege injury from\nthe defendant’s investment of the racketeering\nincome to recover under\n§ 1962(a).’’ Ouaknine v. MacFarlane, 897\nF.2d 75, 83 (2d Cir.1990). The Federal\nPlaintiffs have not done that here and\nseem to abandon the § 1962(a) claim in\ntheir RICO statements. Accordingly, the\nFederal Plaintiffs have not stated a claim\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a).\nThe Federal Plaintiffs’ RICO statements\nagainst Arab Bank and the SAAR Network\nassert claims under § 1962(c) and\n§ 1962(d). See 03 MDL 1570 Docket\n## 307, 309. Subsection (c) states, in\npart: ‘‘It shall be unlawful for any person\nemployed by or associated with any enterprise\nengaged in, or the activities of which\naffect, interstate or foreign commerce, to\nconduct or participate, directly or indirectly,\nin the conduct of such enterprise’s affairs\nthrough a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.’’ 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). ‘‘The four\nelements of Section 1962(c) are ‘(1) conduct\n(2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern\n(4) of racketeering activity.’ ’’ U.S. Fire\nIns. Co. v. United Limousine Serv., Inc.,\n303 F.Supp.2d 432, 451 (S.D.N.Y.2004).\n‘‘The elements of section 1962(c) must be\nestablished as to each individual defendant.’’\nId. Paragraph (d) states that it\n‘‘shall be unlawful for any person to conspire\nto violate any provision of’’ § 1962(a)-\n(c). 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). ‘‘The Second\nCircuit has held in the context of a motion\nto dismiss that to state a claim under [§ ]\n1962(d), the ‘complaint must allege some\nfactual basis for a finding of a conscious\nagreement among the defendants.’ ’’ Am.\nArbitration Ass’n, Inc. v. DeFonseca, No.\n93 Civ. 2424(CSH), 1996 WL 363128, at *7\n(S.D.N.Y. June 28, 1996) (quoting Hecht v.\nCommerce Clearing House, 897 F.2d 21,\n26 n. 4 (2d Cir.1990)); see also Schmidt v.\nFleet Bank, 16 F.Supp.2d 340, 354\n(S.D.N.Y.1998) (‘‘Bare and conclusory allegations\nare insufficient to withstand a motion\nto dismiss and a plaintiff must plead\nfacts sufficient to show that each defendant\nknowingly agreed to participate in\nthe [RICO] conspiracy.’’).\n[75, 76] Assuming for now that the\nPlaintiffs have pleaded an enterprise,\n‘‘[u]nder Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S.\n170, 179, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525\n(1993), an alleged RICO defendant must\nhave had ‘some part in directing’ the ‘operation\nor management’ of the enterprise\nitself to be liable.’’ Dubai Islamic Bank v.\nCitibank, N.A., 256 F.Supp.2d 158, 164\n(S.D.N.Y.2003). The complaints allege the\nmoving Defendants may have assisted al\nQaeda, but they do not allege ‘‘anything\napproaching active ‘management or operation.’\n’’ Id. Accordingly, the Court finds\n828 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nPlaintiffs have failed to state a RICO claim\nagainst the moving Defendants. See id.;\nRedtail Leasing, Inc. v. Bellezza, 95 Civ.\n5191(JFK), 1997 WL 603496, at *5\n(S.D.N.Y.1997) (‘‘A defendant does not ‘direct’\nan enterprise’s affairs under\n§ 1962(c) merely by engaging in wrongful\nconduct that assists the enterprise.’’);\nDep’t of Econ.

Duff & Phelps Credit\nRating Co., 951 F.Supp. 1071, 1090\n(S.D.N.Y.1996) (same). Plaintiffs’ RICO\nclaim under § 1962(d) fails for the same\nreason. Plaintiffs have not alleged that\nthe moving Defendants were central figures\nin the underlying schemes or for conspiracy\nliability under § 1962(d). The\nRICO claims against the moving Defendants\nare dismissed.\n3. TVPA\n[77, 78] ‘‘The TVPA establishes a cause\nof action in federal court against an individual\nwho, under actual or apparent authority,\nor color of law, of any foreign\nnation subjects an individual to torture or\nextrajudicial killing.’’ Arndt v. UBS AG,\n342 F.Supp.2d 132, 141 (E.D.N.Y.2004)\n(citing Flores, 343 F.3d at 153); 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1350 note. Only individuals maybe sued\nunder the TVPA. Arndt, 342 F.Supp.2d at\n141 (citing Friedman v. Bayer Corp., No.\n99 Civ. 3675, 1999 WL 33457825, at *2\n(E.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 1999)). Accordingly, to\nthe extent Plaintiffs have not already withdrawn\nthese claims, the TVPA claims are\ndismissed against Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi\nAmerican Bank, Arab Bank, Al Baraka\nInvestment & Development Corp., NCB,\nSaudi Binladin Group, and the SAAR Network.\nSimilarly, there have been no allegations\nthat Saleh Abdullah Kamel or Adel\nBatterjee acted under color of law and,\ntherefore, the TVPA claims against these\nindividuals are dismissed as well.\n4. ATA\n[79, 80] The ATA provides a civil remedy\nfor ‘‘[a]ny national of the United\nStates injured in his or her person, property,\nor business by reason of an act of\ninternational terrorism, or his or her estate,\nsurvivors, or heirs.’’ 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2333(a). 39 To adequately plead the provision\nof material support under this section,\na plaintiff would have to allege that\nthe defendant knew about the terrorists’\nillegal activities, the defendant desired to\nhelp those activities succeed, and the defendant\nengaged in some act of helping\nthose activities. Boim II, 291 F.3d at\n1023; see also Boim v. Quranic Literacy\nInst., 340 F.Supp.2d 885, 906–913 (N.D.Ill.\n2004) (‘‘Boim III ’’) (granting summary\njudgment against two entity defendants\nwhere record evidence demonstrated the\ncharities’ concession that Hamas used terrorism\nin pursuit of its goals, the organizations’\nrepeated desire to help Hamas by\n39. The ATA defines international terrorism as:\nactivities that—(A) involve violent acts or\nacts dangerous to human life that are a\nviolation of the criminal laws of the United\nStates or of any State, or that would be a\ncriminal violation if committed within the\njurisdiction of the United States or of any\nState; (B) appear to be intended—to intimidate\nor coerce a civilian population; (ii) to\ninfluence the policy of a government by\nintimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect\nthe conduct of a government by assassination\nor kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily\noutside the territorial jurisdiction of the\nUnited States, or transcend national boundaries\nin terms of the means by which they\nare accomplished, the persons they appear\nintended to intimidate or coerce, or the\nlocale in which their perpetrators operate\nor seek asylum.\n18 U.S.C. § 2331(1). For now, the Court\nassumes the attacks of September 11 were an\nact of international terrorism.\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n829\nrecruiting donations to the Holy Land\nFoundation, a known supporter of Hamas,\ndistributing pro-Hamas literature, and featuring\npro-Hamas speakers at their meetings);\nsee also Burnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at\n107 (noting the complaint in Boim was\nquite specific in its allegation of a causal\nlink). Under a conspiracy theory, the\nPlaintiffs have to allege that the Defendants\nwere involved in an agreement to\naccomplish an unlawful act and that the\nattacks of September 11 were a reasonably\nforeseeable consequence of that conspiracy.\nSee Boim III, 340 F.Supp.2d at 895\n(framing analysis as what plaintiffs have to\nprove to succeed on summary judgment).\nPlaintiffs do not have to allege that Defendants\nknew specifically about the September\n11 attacks or that they committed any\nspecific act in furtherance of that attack.\nId.\n5. Wrongful Death and Survival\n[81] New York Estates, Powers and\nTrusts Law governs Plaintiffs’ claims of\nwrongful death and survival. ‘‘The personal\nrepresentative TTT of a decedent who\nis survived by distributees may maintain\nan action to recover damages for a wrongful\nact, neglect or default which caused the\ndecedent’s death against a person who\nwould have been liable to the decedent by\nreason of such wrongful conduct if death\nhad not ensued.’’ N.Y. Est. Powers &\nTrusts § 5–4.1 (McKinney 2002); see also\nN.Y. Est. Powers & Trusts § 11–3.2(b)\n(McKinney 2002) (outlining survival claim:\n‘‘No cause of action for injury to person or\nproperty is lost because of the death of the\nperson in whose favor the cause of action\nexisted. For any injury an action may be\nbrought or continued by the personal representative\nof the decedent.’’). Accordingly,\nthe Court finds that if Plaintiffs are\npersonal representatives and their allegations\nsufficiently allege that Defendants\nsupported, aided and abetted, or conspired\nwith the September 11 terrorists, they will\nhave also stated claims for wrongful death\nand survival.\n6. Assault and Battery and Intentional\nInfliction of Emotional Distress\n[82] The Federal Plaintiffs bring\nclaims of assault and battery and intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress. The\nBurnett and Ashton Plaintiffs also allege\nclaims of intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress. The statute of limitations for\nassault and battery and intentional infliction\nof emotional distress is one year.\nHolmes v. Lorch, 329 F.Supp.2d 516, 523\n(S.D.N.Y.2004); N.Y. C.P.L.R. 215(3)\n(McKinney 2002). The Federal Plaintiffs\nfiled their complaint on September 10,\n2003, nearly two years after September 11,\n2001. Accordingly, their assault and battery\nand intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress claims are dismissed against the\nSAAR Network and Arab Bank.\n[83, 84] ‘‘Under New York law, a claim\nfor intentional infliction of emotional distress\nrequires a showing of (l ) extreme\nand outrageous conduct; (2) intent to\ncause, or reckless disregard of a substantial\nprobability of causing, severe emotional\ndistress; (3) a causal connection between\nthe conduct and the injury; and (4)\nsevere emotional distress.’’ Stuto v. Fleishman,\n164 F.3d 820, 827 (2d Cir.1999)\n(citing Howell v. New York Post Co., 81\nN.Y.2d 115, 121, 596 N.Y.S.2d 350, 612\nN.E.2d 699 (1993)). ‘‘ ‘Liability has been\nfound only where the conduct has been so\noutrageous in character, and so extreme in\ndegree, as to go beyond all possible bounds\nof decency, and to be regarded as atrocious,\nand utterly intolerable in a civilized\nsociety.’ ’’ Id. (quoting Howell, 81 N.Y.2d\nat 122, 596 N.Y.S.2d 350, 612 N.E.2d 699).\nCourts are to determine whether the al-\n830 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nleged conduct is sufficiently extreme and\noutrageous enough to permit recovery.\nStuto, at 827. The attacks on September\n11, 2001 were undoubtedly extreme and\noutrageous. The Court finds that if the\nAshton and Burnett Plaintiffs’s allegations\nsufficiently allege that Defendants supported,\naided and abetted, or conspired\nwith the September 11 terrorists, they will\nhave also stated a claim for intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress. See Burnett\nI, 274 F.Supp.2d at 107–08 (analyzing\nclaims under New York law).\n7. Trespass\n[85] The Federal Plaintiffs bring a\nclaim for trespass on the theory that Defendants\nassisted and encouraged those\nwho intentionally entered the World Trade\nCenter property. New York courts describe\nthis cause of action as ‘‘the interference\nwith a person’s right to possession of\nreal property either by an unlawful act or\na lawful act performed in an unlawful manner.’’\nN.Y. State Nat’l Org. for Women v.\nTerry, 886 F.2d 1339, 1361 (2d Cir.1989)\n(citing Ivancic v. Olmstead, 66 N.Y.2d 349,\n352, 497 N.Y.S.2d 326, 488 N.E.2d 72\n(1985)). To the extent that the Federal\nPlaintiffs sufficiently plead that Defendants\nacted in concert with the September\n11 hijackers, they may proceed with this\nclaim. Wantanabe Realty Corp. v. City of\nNew York, 01 Civ. 10137(LAK), 2003 WL\n22862646, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3., 2003)\n(citing Pittman, 149 F.3d at 122–23).\n8. Negligence\n[86–88] In New York, a plaintiff may\nestablish negligent infliction of emotional\ndistress under the bystander or direct\nduty theory. Baker v. Dorfman, 239 F.3d\n415, 421 (2d Cir.2000). Under the bystander\ntheory, ‘‘a defendant’s conduct is\nnegligent as creating an unreasonable risk\nof bodily harm to a plaintiff and such\nconduct is a substantial factor in bringing\nabout injuries to the plaintiff in consequence\nof shock or fright resulting from\nhis or her contemporaneous observation of\nserious physical injury or death inflicted\nby the defendant’s conduct on a member of\nthe plaintiff’s immediate family in his or\nher presence.’’ Bovsun v. Sanperi, 61\nN.Y.2d 219, 223–24, 473 N.Y.S.2d 357, 461\nN.E.2d 843 (1984). Under the direct duty\ntheory, a plaintiff suffers emotional distress\ncaused by ‘‘defendant’s breach of a\nduty which unreasonably endangered\n[plaintiff’s] own physical safety.’’ Mortise\nv. United States, 102 F.3d 693, 696 (2d\nCir.1996).\n[89–92] To establish a claim for negligence\nunder New York law, ‘‘a plaintiff\nmust show that the defendant owed the\nplaintiff a cognizable duty of care, that the\ndefendant breached that duty, and that the\nplaintiff suffered damages as a proximate\ncause of that breach.’’ King v. Crossland\nSavings Bank, 111 F.3d 251, 259 (2d Cir.\n1997). The most basic element of a negligence\nclaim is the existence of a duty owed\nto plaintiffs by defendants. Palsgraf v.\nLong Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 342,\n162 N.E. 99 (1928); see also Burnett I, 274\nF.Supp.2d at 108 (dismissing negligence\nclaims against Defendant Al Haramain Islamic\nFoundation because complaint failed\nto allege or identify any duty owed to\nPlaintiffs). Banks do not owe non-customers\na duty to protect them from the intentional\ntorts of their customers. Renner v.\nChase Manhattan Bank, No. 98 Civ.\n926(CSH), 1999 WL 47239, at *13\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 1999) (citing cases);\nBurnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at 109 (‘‘Plaintiffs\noffer no support, and we have found none,\nfor the proposition that a bank is liable for\ninjuries done with money that passes\nthrough its hands in the form of deposits,\nwithdrawals, check clearing services, or\nany other routine banking service.’’). The\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n831\ncomplaints presently before the Court do\nnot allege or identify a duty owed to Plaintiffs\nby moving Defendants. See Burnett\nI, 274 F.Supp.2d at 108–09. Accordingly,\nthe negligence and negligent infliction of\nemotional distress claims are dismissed for\nfailure to state a claim.\nB. Analysis of Claims Against the\nMoving Defendants\n[93] While applying the liberal notice\npleading requirements of Rule 8, the Court\nnotes that in light of ‘‘the extreme nature\nof the charge of terrorism, fairness requires\nextra-careful scrutiny of Plaintiffs’\nallegations as to any particular defendant,\nto ensure that he-or it-does indeed have\nfair notice of [the claims].’’ Id. at 103–04.\n1. Al Rajhi Bank\n[94] Al Rajhi Bank was founded in\n1987 and now has a network of nearly 400\nbranch offices throughout Saudi Arabia\nand seventeen worldwide subsidiaries.\nBurnett Complaint ¶ 84. All the banking\nDefendants are alleged to have ‘‘provided\nessential support to the al Qaeda organization\nand operations. The banking Defendants\nin this lawsuit have acted as instruments\nof terror, in raising, facilitating and\ntransferring money to terrorist organizations.’’\nBurnett Complaint ¶ 46. Plaintiffs\nclaim that Al Rajhi Bank is ‘‘the primary\nbank for a number of charities that serve\nas al Qaeda front groups,’’ including Al\nHaramain, MWL, WAMY, SJRC, and\nIIRO. Burnett Complaint ¶ 85; Rule 12(e)\nStatement ¶ 31. ‘‘Al Rajhi continues to\nmaintain Al Haramain’s accounts despite\nAl Haramain’s designation on March 11,\n2002 as terrorist organizations by both the\nUnited States and Saudi Arabian authorities.’’\nRule 12(e) Statement ¶ 44. The\nBurnett Plaintiffs claim Al Rajhi Bank\nknew or had to know that its depositors,\nDefendant charities WAMY, MWL, IIRC,\nand SJRC were material supporters of\nterrorism. Rule 12(e) Statement ¶¶ 44–60.\nThe Burnett Plaintiffs claim that Saudi\nArabia has ‘‘ineffective and/or rudimentary\nbank supervisory, anti-money laundering\nlaws and anti-terrorist financing in place.’’\nRule 12(e) Statement ¶¶ 72–78. In 1999,\nWilliam Weschler of the National Security\nCouncil and Richard Newcomb of the Office\nof Foreign Assets Control traveled to\nSaudi Arabia to warn Al Rajhi Bank and\nits regulator, the Saudi Arabian Monetary\nAgency (‘‘SAMA’’), ‘‘that their financial\nsystems were being manipulated or utilized\nto fund terrorist organizations such\nas Al Qaeda.’’ Id. ¶ 75. The United\nStates encouraged SAMA to adopt ‘‘know\nyour customer’’ rules. Id. ‘‘Despite these\nwarnings, Al Rajhi failed to adopt even the\nmost minimal standards, [which] resulted\nin the use of Al Rajhi as an instrument of\nterror and a material supporter, aider and\nabettor of al Qaeda and international terrorist\nactivities.’’ Id. ¶¶ 76–77.\nOne of the hijackers on board American\nAirlines Flight 11, Abdulaziz al-Omari,\nheld an account at Al Rajhi Bank. Burnett\nComplaint ¶ 85; Rule 12(e) Statement ¶ 43.\nAnother hijacker, Mohammed Atta, made\na transfer to this account at some time.\nRule 12(e) Statement ¶ 43. Plaintiffs claim\nal Qaeda financier Zouaydi asked Abdullah\nbin Abdul Muhsen al Turki, a counselor to\nthe government of Saudi Arabia, to send\nmoney through Al Rajhi. Burnett Complaint\n¶¶ 388, 538.\nThe Burnett Plaintiffs also claim that Al\nRajhi Bank has relationships with Hamas\nand other terrorists. Rule 12(e) Statement\n¶¶ 61–69. Al Rajhi Bank chose Texas-based\nInfocom to host its website. Id.\n¶¶ 65, 66. Infocom has provided funding\nto Hamas and is owned and operated by\nHamas leader and designated terrorist,\nMousa Marzook. Id. There have been\ntransfers made to Marzook and Infocom\n832 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nfrom Al Rajhi accounts. Id. In ‘‘December\n1999, Al Rajhi directly funded Tulkarm\nCharity Committee, a known front for Hamas.’’\nId. ¶ 71.\nMembers of the Al Rajhi family, which\nowns and controls Al Rajhi Bank, are alleged\nto have ties to Osama bin Laden’s\npersonal secretary. Id. ¶ 79. The Al Rajhi\nfamily is purportedly a major donor to\nthe SAAR Network, a Defendant here,\nbeing investigated by federal authorities in\nVirginia. Id. ¶¶ 80–84. Finally, Al Rajhi\nfamily members are allegedly closely associated\nwith wealthy donors to Osama bin\nLaden. Id. ¶ 85 (alleging ties with the\nGolden Chain).\nJudge Robertson found that the only\nallegation in the Third Amended Burnett\nComplaint that stated a claim upon which\nrelief could be granted was that Al Rajhi\nBank acted as an instrument ‘‘of terror, in\nraising, facilitating and transferring money\nto terrorist organizations.’’ Burnett I, 274\nF.Supp.2d at 109 (quoting Burnett Complaint\n¶ 46). Judge Robertson noted that\nthere was no support ‘‘for the proposition\nthat a bank is liable for injuries done with\nmoney that passes through its hands in the\nform of deposits, withdrawals, check clearing\nservices, or any other routine banking\nservice.’’ Id. In light of the liberal pleading\nstandards, however, Judge Robertson\ndenied Al Rajhi Bank’s motion to dismiss\nand permitted it to request a more definitive\nstatement under Rule 12(e). Id. at\n110. The Burnett Plaintiffs provided an\n89–paragraph response on August 27,\n2003. Thereafter, Al Rajhi Bank renewed\nits motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6).\n40. Under Islamic banking laws, Hararm is\nforbidden income that must be given away.\nThe disposal of Hararm cannot be considered\ncharitable giving. Rule 12(e) Statement ¶ 9.\nIn the 12(e) statement, the Burnett Plaintiffs\nexplain that al Qaeda takes advantage of the\nunder-regulated Islamic banking system to\nAl Rajhi Bank argues that Plaintiffs offer\nno factual allegations in support of\ntheir conclusion that Al Rajhi Bank had to\nknow that the charities it supported\nthrough Zakat and Hararm 40 payments\nwere really fronts for al Qaeda. Al Rajhi\nBank contends it had a legal and religious\nduty to make its charitable donations and\nany terrorist activity by the recipient charities\nwas unknown to Al Rajhi Bank. See\nRule 12(e) Statement ¶¶ 26, 29. Contrary\nto Plaintiffs’ arguments, Al Rajhi Bank\nsubmits it did not have a duty, or a right,\nto inspect the Defendant charities’ financial\ntransactions to ascertain the ultimate\ndestination of its donations. But see Rule\n12(e) Statement ¶ 32 (‘‘Al Rajhi is required\nto determine that the ultimate recipients of\nthese contributions fall within one of the\ncategories prescribed in the Quran for recipients\nof Zakat.’’). Al Rajhi Bank submits\nthat SAMA did not implement any\nduty to investigate Zakat payments after\nits meeting with representatives of the National\nSecurity Council and Office of Foreign\nAssets Control.\n[95] Plaintiffs do not allege that Al\nRajhi Bank provided direct material support\nto al Qaeda. Rather, Plaintiffs claim\nAl Rajhi Bank aided and abetted the September\n11 terrorists by donating to certain\nDefendant charities and acting as the bank\nfor these Defendants. New York law and\nthe courts interpreting the ATA in Boim\nmake very clear that concerted action liability\nrequires general knowledge of the\nprimary actor’s conduct. See Pittman, 149\nF.3d at 123; Boim II, 291 F.3d at 1023;\nBoim III, 340 F.Supp.2d at 906. Even\nmove and launder money. 12(e) Statement\n¶ 1. Plaintiffs allege that al Qaeda has perverted\nthe Zakat and Hararm principles in Islamic\nbanking to collect and distribute money to\nindividuals and cells throughout the world.\nId. ¶¶ 4–9; see also Burnett Complaint ¶ 43.\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n833\nwith the opportunity to clarify their claims\nagainst Al Rajhi Bank, the Burnett Plaintiffs\ndo not offer facts to support their\nconclusions that Al Rajhi Bank had to\nknow that Defendant charities WAMY,\nMWL, IIRC, and SJRC were supporting\nterrorism. See Rule 12(e) Statement\n¶¶ 44–60. ‘‘[A] complaint which consists of\nconclusory allegations unsupported by factual\nassertions fails even on the liberal\nstandard of Rule 12(b)(6).’’ De Jesus v.\nSears, Roebuck & Co., 87 F.3d 65, 70 (2d\nCir.1996).\nThis Court, like Judge Robertson before\nit, has found no basis for a bank’s liability\nfor injuries funded by money passing\nthrough it on routine banking business.\nSee Burnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at 109. Similarly,\nallegations concerning the Al Rajhi\nfamily cannot support a claim against Al\nRajhi Bank because there is no allegation\nthat the family members were acting in\nfurtherance of Al Rajhi Bank business.\nTasso v. Platinum Guild Int’l, 94 Civ.\n8288(LAP), 1997 WL 16066, at *6\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, 1997). Plaintiffs attach\nto their opposition brief a September 2002\nSAMA report summarizing the initiatives\nand actions taken by the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia to combat money laundering and\nterrorist financing. See Burnett Plaintiffs’\nOpp. to Al Rajhi Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 2.\nNeither this document, nor the complaint,\nalleges that SAMA or Al Rajhi Bank implemented\n‘‘know your customer’’ rules\nthat Al Rajhi failed to follow with respect\nto accounts held by the Defendant charities.\nFinally, Plaintiffs’ allegations that Al\nRajhi Bank has connections to Hamas supporters\nfails to state a claim because Plaintiffs\nhave not alleged any relationship between\nHamas and al Qaeda or the terrorist\n41. The Ashton Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed\nits claims against the Saudi Cement Company\nand the Arabian Cement Company on June\n10, 2004. See 03 MD 1570 Docket # 230.\nattacks of September 11. Even accepting\nall the allegations against Al Rajhi Bank as\ntrue, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim\nthat would entitle them to relief. Accordingly,\nAl Rajhi Bank’s motion to dismiss\nthe Burnett complaint is granted in its\nentirety.\n2. Saudi American Bank\n[96] Saudi American Bank is based in\nRihadh, Saudi Arabia and was formed in\n1980 pursuant to a royal decree to take\nover the then-existing branches of Citibank\nin Riyadh and Jeddah. Ashton Complaint\n¶ 603; Burnett Complaint ¶ 140. It\nis the second largest bank in Saudi Arabia\nand has offices in the United States, based\nin New York. Ashton Complaint ¶ 604;\nBurnett Complaint ¶¶ 141–42. Its chairman,\nAbdullahziz Bin Hamad Al Gosaibi is\nalso the Chairman of the Saudi Cement\nCompany in Damman, Saudi Arabia. Ashton\nComplaint ¶ 605; Burnett Complaint\n¶ 142. 41 Ahmed Ali Jumale, purportedly a\nclose associate of Osama bin Laden and\nresponsible for helping Defendant Al Baraka\npenetrate the United States banking\nsystem, allegedly worked for Saudi American\nBank as a senior employee from 1979\nto 1986. Ashton Complaint ¶ 602; Burnett\nComplaint ¶ 148. 42\nPlaintiffs claim that Saudi American\nBank is the official correspondent of the al\nBaraka Bank Lebanon; the Riyadh correspondent\nof Defendant Al Faisal Islamic\nBank, which is managed by Defendant\nPrince Mohamed; and the Riyadh correspondent\nbank for a branch of Defendant\nAl Shamal Islamic Bank, which is involved\nin the financing of al Qaeda. Ashton Complaint\n¶¶ 606, 608; Burnett Complaint\n¶¶ 143, 146. It is also the bank for Defen-\n42. The Ashton Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed\ntheir claims against Ahmed Nur Ali Jumale on\nJune 10, 2004. See 03 MD 1570 Docket\n# 230.\n834 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\ndant Dallah Al Baraka Group, which is\nchaired by Defendant Saleh Abdullah Kamel.\nSaudi American Bank is close to the\nSaudi Bin Laden family, TTT appears on its\nfinancial transactions’’ and provides banking\nservices to its Sudanese operations.\nAshton Complaint ¶¶ 607–8; Burnett Complaint\n¶¶ 144, 146.\n‘‘In the year 2000, the Saudi American\nBank participated in the fundraising campaign\nin Saudi Arabia for collecting donations\nto the ‘heroes of the Al Quds uprising’\n(Intifada) by providing a bank account\nand facilities to receive donations for a\ncommittee of charity organizations including\nDefendants WAMY, IIRO and Al Haramain\nFoundation.’’ Ashton Complaint\n¶ 609; Burnett Complaint ¶ 147.\nThe essence of Plaintiffs’ claim is that\nthrough its relationships with other banks\nand support of the Saudi Binladin group’s\nwork in Sudan, Saudi American Bank provided\nmaterial support to al Qaeda. It is\nnot alleged to have done anything to directly\nsupport al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden,\nor their terrorist agenda. As the Court\nhas stated before, there can be no bank\nliability for injuries caused by money routinely\npassing through the bank. Saudi\nAmerican Bank is not alleged to have\nknown that anything relating to terrorism\nwas occurring through the services it provided.\nThe Ashton Plaintiffs have dismissed\ntheir claims against Ahmed Nur Ali\nJumale, allegedly an associate of Osama\nbin Laden. To the extent the Burnett\nPlaintiffs continue their claims against\nhim, his employment at Saudi American\nBank from 1979 to 1986 cannot be grounds\nfor relief. Osama bin Laden did not organize\nal Qaeda until the late 1980s, Saudi\nAmerican Bank is not alleged to have provided\nJumale with a veil of legitimacy or\nshelter. Cf. Burnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at\n104 (finding Al Haramain’s employment of\nal Qaeda operative during height of al\nQaeda activity a sufficient allegation of\nproviding material support). The complaints\nhave provided Saudi American\nBank with no notice of Plaintiffs’ claims or\ngrounds for relief. Accordingly, Saudi\nAmerican Bank’s motions to dismiss the\nAshton and Burnett complaints are granted\nin their entirety.\n3. Arab Bank\n[97] The Federal Plaintiffs claim Arab\nBank is a financial institution headquartered\nin Egypt with branch offices\nthroughout the world, including New York.\nFederal Complaint ¶ 357. Arab Bank\nclaims it is actually a Jordanian bank\nheadquartered in Amman, Jordan. Arab\nBank allegedly has ‘‘long provided financial\nservices and other forms of material\nsupport to terrorist organizations, including\nal Qaeda.’’ Federal Complaint ¶ 358.\nFurther, these Plaintiffs allege that the\nSeptember 11 attacks were a ‘‘direct, intended\nand foreseeable product of Arab\nBank’s participation in al Qaeda’s jihadist\ncampaign.’’ Id. ¶¶ 364, 363. These claims\nare based on the allegation that Arab Bank\nhas ‘‘long known that accounts it maintained\nwere being used to solicit and transfer\nfunds to terrorist organizations [and\ndespite this knowledge] Arab Bank has\ncontinued to maintain those accounts.’’ Id.\n¶ 362. Specifically, the Federal Plaintiffs\nclaim Arab Bank accounts have been used\nfor al Qaeda money transfers throughout\nthe world and that Arab Bank maintains\naccounts for Defendant charities including\nIIRO, MWL, WAMY, BIF, Blessed Relief\n(Muwaffaq) Foundation, and Al Haramain.\nId. ¶¶ 359, 360. Israeli officials allegedly\nhave seized funds associated with several\nArab Bank accounts maintained on behalf\nof known fronts for Hamas and identified\nby Arab Bank employees, ‘‘confirming the\nbank’s specific knowledge that accounts it\nmaintained were being used to sponsor\nterrorist activity.’’ Id. ¶ 361.\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n835\nThe Burnett Plaintiffs claim that members\nof the Spanish al Qaeda cell used\nArab Bank to make wire transfers. Burnett\nComplaint ¶ 138 (alleging Arab Bank\nis ‘‘used regularly by al Qaeda’s Spanish\ncell for transfers of cash to members of al\nQaeda operating in Germany, Pakistan, Afghanistan,\nLebanon, Yemen, Bosnia, and\nelsewhere’’); id. ¶¶ 139, 528 (alleging\n$6,400 wire transfer through Arab Bank\nfrom member of Spanish al Qaeda cell to\nan extremist associated with Chej Salah in\nSpain). These Plaintiffs conclude that\n‘‘Arab Bank PLC has materially supported,\naided, and abetted and financed al\nQaeda.’’ Id. ¶ 138.\nThe Federal and Burnett complaints do\nnot include any facts to support the inference\nthat Arab Bank knew or had to know\nthat it was providing material support to\nterrorists by providing financial services to\nthe charity Defendants or by processing\nwire transfers in Spain. The paragraphs\ndo not allege any involvement by, knowledge\nof, or participation in any wrongful\nconduct by Arab Bank. These Plaintiffs do\nnot claim that Arab Bank ignored any\nregulations regarding their customer accounts.\nProviding routine banking services,\nwithout having knowledge of the terrorist\nactivities, cannot subject Arab Bank\nto liability. While claiming Arab Bank has\nties with known Hamas fronts, the Federal\ncomplaint does not contain any allegation\nof a connection between Hamas and Osama\nbin Laden, al Qaeda, or the September\n11 attacks. A complaint alleging conclusions\nwithout supporting facts will not survive\na Rule 12(b)(6) motion. In re Cross\nMedia Mktg. Corp. Sec. Litig., 314\nF.Supp.2d 256, 261 (S.D.N.Y.2004). The\nFederal Plaintiffs asked for leave to amend\ntheir complaint with respect to Arab Bank,\nbut they have not offered any facts to\nsupport an amendment. Therefore, Arab\nBank’s motions to dismiss the Federal and\nBurnett complaints are granted in their\nentirety.\n4. Al Baraka Investment & Development\nCorporation and Saleh Abdullah\nKamel\n[98] The Ashton and Burnett complaints\ndetail nearly identical claims\nagainst Al Baraka Investment & Development\nCorp. (‘‘Al Baraka’’) and Saleh Abdullah\nKamel. Ashton Complaint ¶¶ 583–\n601; Burnett Complaint ¶¶ 47–66. Saleh\nAbdullah Kamel was born in Saudi Arabia\nin 1941 and founded Dallah Albaraka\nGroup LLC in 1969. Ashton Complaint\n¶ 587; Burnett Complaint ¶ 51. Dallah Albaraka\nis a diversified conglomerate based\nin Jeddah and includes twenty-three banks\nin Arab and Islamic countries. Ashton\nComplaint ¶ 588; Burnett Complaint ¶ 52.\nDallah Albaraka is a shareholder of Aqsa\nIslamic Bank, a bank that Israel has refused\nto approve, ‘‘citing its obvious ties\nwith known terrorists.’’ Ashton Complaint\n¶¶ 596, 597; Burnett Complaint ¶¶ 60, 61.\nOne of Dallah Albaraka’s subsidiaries is\nDallah Avco Trans–Arabia Co., based in\nJeddah. Ashton Complaint ¶ 589; Burnett\nComplaint ¶ 53. Omar al Bayoumi, a suspect\nwanted by the FBI in connection with\nthe September 11 attacks, was the Assistant\nto the Director of Finance for Dallah\nAvco and paid rent in San Diego for the\nhouse occupied by two September 11 hijackers\nof American Airlines Flight 77.\nAshton Complaint ¶¶ 590, 592; Burnett\nComplaint ¶¶ 55, 54. Mr. Kamel is also\none of three founders of Defendant Al\nShamal Islamic Bank. Ashton Complaint\n¶ 594; Burnett Complaint ¶ 58.\nDallah Albaraka’s financial arm is Al\nBaraka Investment & Development Corp.,\na wholly owned subsidiary based in Jeddah.\nAshton Complaint ¶ 593; Burnett\nComplaint ¶ 57. Al Baraka is a holding\ncompany with 43 subsidiaries, which are\n836 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\nmainly banks in Arab and Islamic countries.\nAshton Complaint ¶ 583; Burnett\nComplaint ¶ 47. It also has banks in Chicago,\nIllinois and Houston, Texas. Burnett\nComplaint ¶ 47. Al Baraka allegedly\nprovided financial infrastructures in Sudan\nto Osama bin Laden through Defendant\ncharity Al Haramain. Ashton Complaint\n¶¶ 584, 585, 598; Burnett Complaint ¶¶ 48,\n49, 62.\nPlaintiffs do not offer any factual allegations\nagainst Al Baraka or Mr. Kamel to\nwithstand their motions to dismiss. The\nmajority of the complaints’ allegations regarding\nAl Baraka actually concern Dallah\nAlbaraka. The specific allegations against\nAl Baraka are that through Al Haramain it\nprovided financial infrastructures in Sudan,\nit provided support to Al Haramain,\nand it is present in the Sudan banking\nbusiness through banks it holds. The\ncomplaints do not allege that Al Baraka\nknew or had any reason to know that Al\nHaramain was supporting terrorism, nor\ndo they allege facts from which such an\ninference could be drawn.\nThe allegation that an employee of a\nDallah Albaraka subsidiary financially supported\ntwo of the hijackers in San Diego\ndoes not translate into an allegation that\nMr. Kamel provided material support to\nterrorism or aided and abetted those that\nprovided material support. An employee’s\nactions cannot be a basis for employer\nliability unless the employee was acting in\nfurtherance of the employer’s business.\nTasso, 1997 WL 16066, at *6. There is no\nallegation that Mr. Kamel knew Mr. al\nBayoumi or directed anyone at the Della\nAlbaraka subsidiary to support al Qaeda or\nthe hijackers. Similarly, the allegation\nthat Mr. Kamel was one of three founders\nof Al Shamal Islamic Bank in 1983, without\nadditional allegations, does not state a\nclaim for relief. Thus, the Ashton and\nBurnett claims against Al Baraka and Mr.\nKamel are dismissed in their entirety.\n5. NCB\n[99] The Ashton and Burnett Plaintiffs’\nallegations against NCB are outlined\nin Part I.B.4. The Court finds it would be\npremature to analyze Plaintiffs’ largely\nconclusory claims against NCB under Rule\n12(b)(6) at this time. NCB may be immune\nfrom suit and further discovery if it\nis found to be an instrumentality of the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and its actions\ndo not fit within the FSIA’s exceptions to\nimmunity. Additionally, the Court is not\nyet convinced that it would be proper to\nexercise personal jurisdiction over NCB.\nAccordingly, NCB’s motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim is denied without\nprejudice. NCB may renew its motion\nupon completion of the limited jurisdictional\ndiscovery—first with respect to its instrumentality\nstatus—outlined by the\nCourt above.\n6. Saudi Binladin Group\n[100] The Ashton and Burnett allegations\nagainst the SBG are outlined in Part\nII.C.8. The same allegations that warrant\nlimited jurisdictional discovery to investigate\nwhether SBG purposefully directed\nits activities at the United States and its\ncontacts with the United States preclude\ndismissal under 12(b)(6) at this time. SBG\nprovided construction support to Osama\nbin Laden. Ashton Complaint ¶¶ 550,\n552–53; Burnett Complaint ¶¶ 319–22. A\nbranch of SBG purportedly provided shelter\nto an al Qaeda operative. Ashton\nComplaint ¶ 555; Burnett Complaint ¶ 324.\nSBG has, at some point, had a close relationship\nwith Osama bin Laden, but the\ncomplaints do not specify when or whether\nthe relationship continues. While these\nallegations are certainly not sufficient to\nreach a jury, if Plaintiffs demonstrate that\nIN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n837\nthis Court has personal jurisdiction over\nSBG they are entitled the opportunity to\ndevelop these claims. SBG’s motions to\ndismiss the Ashton and Burnett complaints\nfor failure to state a claim are therefore\ndenied without prejudice.\n7. SAAR Network\n[101] The Federal Plaintiffs’ allegations\nagainst the SAAR Network are outlined\nin Part II.C.9. The Court’s analysis\nof the SAAR Network’s arguments in favor\nof 12(b)(6) dismissal depend on a predicate\nfinding of which entities are subject\nto this Court’s personal jurisdiction and\nwhich entities—and under what circumstances—transferred\nmoney to terror\nfronts. Accordingly, the SAAR Network’s\nmotion to dismiss is denied without prejudice.\nIt may be renewed upon completion\nof personal jurisdiction discovery.\n8. Adel A.J. Batterjee\n[102] The Burnett Plaintiffs’ allegations\nagainst Mr. Batterjee are outlined in\nPart II.C.10. For substantially the same\nreasons the Court found it had personal\njurisdiction over Mr. Batterjee, it denies\nhis motion to dismiss for failure to state a\nclaim. The allegations against him and his\ndesignation as a terrorist are sufficient to\npermit the inference that he provided support\nto al Qaeda directly or through Al\nShamal Islamic Bank, BIF, or WAMY.\nBurnett Complaint ¶¶ 75–76, 183–84, 196,\n199, 230; Exec. Order 13224.\nIV.
