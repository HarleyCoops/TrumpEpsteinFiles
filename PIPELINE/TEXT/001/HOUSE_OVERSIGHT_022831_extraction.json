Btw, I've just filed a column for USA Today for Monday \nexplaining how Dershowitz and Andrew allegations were picked up from unverified civil court docs, \ntransferred to UK tabs, which go wild because of no libel rules on U.S. court papers, and then translated \nback here as \"reported fact.\" Problem with story is that tabs are too invested in present story line, \nand unlikely that the Times or WSJ will want to touch it--tho, depending on who is willing to on record, \nthey might. There is another politico reporter I know who might do it, again, if the on-the-record sources \nare public people. Or, I will use it for New York Magazine, but that won't be until Feb.
