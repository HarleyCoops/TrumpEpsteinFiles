For his part, the Kazakh leader wants to make sure that the Americans stay out \nof the dispute, and not allow it to affect their alliance with his government. \nThe Obama administration has done just that. Through comments in secret diplomatic cables, the former \nambassador to Kazakhstan made clear his wariness of being drawn in. \n\"Both sides — the government and Aliyev — seek to manipulate us to their own advantage,\" Richard E. \nHoagland, who ended his term as United States ambassador early this year, wrote in February 2009 in one of \nmore than a dozen State Department cables obtained by the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks that mentioned the \ndispute. [*] \nMr. Nazarbayev, 70, [*]a former steel worker and Soviet-era Communist Party leader, has been in power for \ntwo decades, presiding over Central Asia's most vibrant economy. Human rights activists, however, have \nlong accused him of persecuting dissidents and political opponents. \nMr. Aliyev, 48, [*]has served as chief of the tax police, deputy foreign affairs minister and head of the \nKazakh equivalent of the K.G.B. But critics say he used his clout to secretly take over private companies for \nfinancial gain, often by threatening violence. \nNow hiding somewhere in Europe, he has been convicted back home on what he claims are trumped-up \ncriminal charges, including a coup attempt. His wife divorced him in June 2007, and the Kazakh government \nhas taken businesses owned by him and members of his extended family. [*] \nNo longer powerful at home, Mr. Aliyev turned to Washington, knowing that his former father-in-law cared \ngreatly about his reputation there. \nEarly in 2008 he hired RJI Government Strategies, a small Washington lobbying group whos \ne consultants \nincluded Tanya Rahall, sister of Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a West Virginia Democrat; and a friend of \nRepresentative Darrell Issa, Republican of California. Both congressmen were booked on a trip to Kazakhstan \nto discuss energy policy with Mr. Nazarbayev. \nBefore their departure, members of___________________________to urge him to express strong concerns about the \nharm done to a relative of Mr. Aliyev named Devincci Hourani, whose oil-company assets in Kazakhstan \nwere seized, according to a letter to Mr. Issa from RJI. \nMr. Issa, who had developed a rapport with the Kazakh president on an earlier visit, nonetheless agreed to \ntake up the plight of Mr. Hourani. Though he stepped into the fight, he still maintained a close connection to \nthe president, nominating him that summer for the Nobel Prize, a move that drew ridicule from human rights \nactivists. [that's right, of Vista, CA] [*] \nMs. Rahall worked on behalf of Mr. Aliyev and later for Mr. Hourani through 2010, contacting the offices of \nat least two dozen members of Congress. They included Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of \nCalifornia, then chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, whose office said he discussed the dispute \nwith the State Department. \nMs. Rahall also pursued a second strategy. \"The alternative is to embarrass the existing regime,\" she wrote in \na July 2008 e-mail to her boss. \nShe pressed House members to criticize the Kazakh government's human rights record. At her request, at \nleast five statements were published in the Congressional Record, one citing Mr. Aliyev as a victim of his \ngovernment. Separately, Mr. Aliyev offered to provide the Justice Department with documents that he \nclaimed could prove that his former father-in-law accepted bribes from a businessman representing American \noil companies that were seeking drilling rights in Kazakhstan \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031153 \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
