While most of these laws\nare medical cannabis laws, 8 states have enacted recreational laws.\nAcross all medical cannabis laws in the United States, cannabis is legally\nrecognized as a form of therapy or medicine for more than 50 qualifying\nconditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, anorexia, arthritis, cancer, chronic\npain, epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder.\nCalifornia is poised to become the largest recreational cannabis market\nin the world with the implementation of its recreational law in January\n2018—a watershed moment for the industry.\nThe illegal cannabis market in the United States is estimated to be more\nthan $45 billion annually. (We estimate that the 2017 U.S. state-legal\ncannabis market was $8.0 billion.) If federal legalization occurs, we believe\nthat the legal market could be more than two times the size of the current\nillegal market, ultimately exceeding $100 billion annually.\nThe cannabis industry provides a broad range of investment opportunities\nin both the public and private markets for sophisticated investors who are\nwilling to take significant risks.\nAckrell Capital is based in San Francisco, CA.\nAckrell Capital is a member of\nFINRA and SIPC.\nThis report has been compiled for informational purposes only, and is not a research report.

Much has happened in the\nnearly two years since we published our inaugural report: the cannabis industry grew significantly, companies\nin the industry raised large amounts of capital and their stock prices performed well, and the legalization\nmovement continued worldwide as more countries and U.S. states implemented a framework for\nlegal cannabis access. There was also a presidential election in the United States; its ultimate impact on\nthe cannabis industry remains uncertain. What did not happen since we launched our inaugural report?\nFederal legali zation: “marijuana” continues to be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the\nControlled Substances Act in the United States.\nIn this new edition, we introduce an outlook on global cannabis markets, analyze capital markets for\ncannabis companies and present updated market estimates. We also expand on the first edition by providing\nmore in-depth analyses of the various market segments within—and analyzing the legal issues pertinent\nto—the cannabis industry. The Top 100 Private Cannabis Companies list has been updated and our industry\nlandscape, The Green Field, has been updated and expanded to include more than 500 companies.\nCannabis legalization has accelerated domestically and internationally. In the 2016 U.S. elections, four\nstates, including California, legalized recreational cannabis (bringing the total number of states with recreational\nlaws to eight) and an additional four states legalized medical cannabis. Cannabis use is now statelegal\nin some form in 46 states.\nIn January 2018, California will implement its recreational law, making it the largest market globally\nfor the recreational use of cannabis. Similarly, Canada is expected to pass its recreational law in mid-2018.\nAnd in 2017, Germany became the most populous country in the world to pass a medical cannabis law.\nCannabis has mass consumer appeal around the world. (According to the United Nations, more than\n180 million people per year use cannabis and it is the most-consumed drug worldwide). While it is clear\nthat there is significant demand for cannabis, less clear is how quickly illegal markets will transition to\nlegal markets, as well as the extent to which legalization may increase overall demand.\nWe continue to believe that it is a question of when—not if—the U.S. federal prohibition on cannabis\nwill end. We believe that a path toward federal legalization exists and we believe this process has commenced.\nAccording to Gallup, 64% of Americans today believe that cannabis use should be legal.\nWho is the cannabis consumer? It is the 80-year-old cancer patient ingesting cannabis to treat side\neffects of chemotherapy. It is the 12-year-old child using cannabis extracts on a doctor’s recommendation\nto reduce epileptic seizures. It is the 30-something mother or father seeking to relax after a full day. It is\na group of 20-year-olds on a Friday night heading to a concert. It is the millions of people suffering from\nanxiety and depression. It is the millions of people treating chronic pain and nausea. It is the millions of\npeople using cannabis recreationally.\nOur team has met with more than 1,000 companies in the cannabis industry. We understand the opportunities\nand challenges facing the industry, and we are happy to provide our insights.\nSincerely,\nThe Ackrell Capital Cannabis Team\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nn Table of Contents\nCHAPTER I Executive Summary .......................................................... 1\nn Global Cannabis Consumers n To Watch in 2018 n Investment Outlook\nCHAPTER II Cannabis Science 101........................................................ 15\nn The Cannabis Plant n The Human Endocannabinoid System\nn Cannabinoids n Terpenes n Cannabis Formulations\nCHAPTER III Cannabis Industry Segmentation. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\nn Production n Distribution n Consumer Products\nn Business Solutions n Digital Media\nCHAPTER IV U.S. Legal Landscape ........................................................ 61\nn U.S. State Law n U.S. Federal Law n The Path to Federal Legalization\nCHAPTER V Global Cannabis Regulation. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 91\nn Global Cannabis Legalization Momentum n United Nations Conventions\nn Global Legal Developments n Global Outlook\nCHAPTER VI U.S. and International Cannabis Market Estimates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 103\nn Global Market Overview n U.S. State-Legal Cannabis Market\nn U.S. Legalized Cannabis Market Forecast\nn International Legal Cannabis Market Forecast\nCHAPTER VII Capital Markets for Cannabis Companies ....................................117\nn Capital Markets Overview n Public Capital Markets\nn Public Capital Markets: United States n Public Capital Markets: Canada\nn Private Capital Markets n Final Thoughts\nCHAPTER VIII Top 100 Private Cannabis Companies 2018 ..................................137\nCHAPTER IX Cannabis Industry Risk Factors .............................................165\nCHAPTER X Glossary of Terms ..........................................................169\nDisclosures, Disclaimers, Sources and Use ...................................175\nAckrell Capital Cannabis Team ..............................................176\nFRONT COVER\nReport Highlights\nBACK COVER The Green Field 2018\nii © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER I\nExecutive Summary\nn Global Cannabis Consumers\nCannabis has mass consumer appeal around the world. Millions of people use cannabis recreationally.\nMillions more use it medicinally. In aggregate, across all state medical cannabis laws in the United States,\ncannabis is legally recognized as a form of therapy or medicine for more than 50 medical conditions,\nincluding Alzheimer’s disease, anorexia, arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy and post-traumatic\nstress disorder. Similar to the alcohol and pharmaceutical markets, we believe that the total addressable\nconsumer market for cannabis consists of a significant portion of the global adult population.\nCannabis is the most widely cultivated, produced, trafficked and consumed drug worldwide,\naccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2003, the UNODC\nestimated that the global illegal cannabis market was $113 billion, with 160 million consumers. The\nUNODC continues to estimate the number of cannabis users worldwide and recently estimated that\n183 million people globally between the ages of 15 and 64, or more than 4% of this age group, consumed\ncannabis in 2015.\nIn 2010, the RAND Corporation (RAND) estimated that the U.S. illegal cannabis market was\n$40 billion. Adjusting this estimate solely for inflation and population growth, the U.S. illegal market\nwould now be approximately $48 billion.\nBoth the UNODC and RAND acknowledge the challenges inherent in studying an illegal consumer\nmarket, and both allow significant room for error in their estimates. However approximate,\ntheir estimates make clear that there is significant global demand for cannabis. Less clear is how quickly\nillegal markets will transition to legal markets, as well as the extent to which legalization may increase\noverall demand.\nWe believe that the growth of the global legal cannabis industry will be driven by increasing penetration\nin largely untapped “mainstream” consumer markets, and that the legal industry could grow\nto more than two times the estimated size of the current illegal market. We believe that cannabis will\neventually become federally legal in the United States, for recreational enjoyment by adults and for use\nin a broad range of safe drugs and therapeutic products. After U.S. federal legalization, we believe that\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 1\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nthe U.S. market will exceed $100 billion annually, with more than 50 million consumers. Globally, we\nestimate that the legal cannabis market has the potential to reach $500 billion annually, approaching\none billion consumers.\nThe Global Legal Cannabis Market\nCannabis legalization is gaining momentum around the world. This momentum is driven primarily by\nthe increasing recognition that cannabis may have a range of legitimate medicinal benefits and therapeutic\napplications. At least 20 countries now have medical laws that facilitate patient access to cannabis\nor cannabis concentrates for treating specified medical conditions. Notable countries with such\nmedical laws include Australia, Canada, Colombia and Germany; countries without such laws include\nChina, Japan, Russia and the United States. (Contrary to U.S. federal law, 29 states, encompassing\n62% of the U.S. population, permit the production and possession of cannabis or concentrates for use\nin treating a broad range of qualifying medical conditions.) While the merits of medical cannabis are\ncurrently driving legalization, we believe that—like Uruguay and numerous U.S. states—other countries\nwill ultimately enact legislation permitting the production, sale and use of recreational cannabis.\n(Canada is widely expected to do so in mid-2018.)\nThe following world map illustrates select countries that (i) have enacted medical laws that facilitate\npatient access to cannabis or concentrates for treating specified medical conditions, (ii) have enacted\nrecreational laws that permit the commercial production and sale of cannabis to adults for recreational\nand other uses, or (iii) include a state or province that has a cannabis law or policy in conflict with\nfederal law.\nSelect Countries with Legalized Cannabis Access (January 2018)\nRecreational Law*\nMedical Law\nState/Province Conflict\nwith Federal Law\n*Canada currently has a medical law.

According\nto federal policy, Americans can access tobacco, alcohol and prescription drug products that\nkill thousands each year, but they cannot access cannabis because it is a dangerous drug with no\ncurrently accepted medical application in the United States (notwithstanding the federal government\nholds a U.S. patent for methods of treating diseases with cannabinoids). Meanwhile,\n46 U.S. states have enacted at least one law that permits the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing or\npossession of cannabis or concentrates. These laws fall into three general categories:\n• 29 U.S. states (and the District of Columbia) have enacted medical cannabis laws that permit\nthe production and possession of cannabis or concentrates for use in treating a broad range of\nqualifying medical conditions.\n• 19 U.S. states have enacted narrow CBD/limited laws that permit possession of small amounts\nof low-THC/high-CBD cannabis concentrates for use in treating a few serious medical conditions—in\nparticular, severe forms of childhood epilepsy.\n• 8 U.S. states have enacted recreational laws that permit the commercial production and sale of\ncannabis to adults for recreational and other uses.\nThe following map of the United States shows states with medical cannabis laws, CBD/limited laws\nor recreational laws (a state with more than one of these laws is represented on the map by its most\npermissive law).\nU.S. State Cannabis Laws (January 2018)\nRecreational Law\nMedical Cannabis Law\nCBD/Limited Law\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 3\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nThe U.S cannabis industry has proven adept at navigating this federal-state conflict, and is experiencing\nrapid growth despite it. We estimate that the 2017 U.S. state-legal cannabis market was $8.0\nbillion, with more than four million consumers. While the overall state-legal market has grown significantly,\nthe addressable market has been constrained due to the lack of access to purely recreational\nconsumers and the sometimes-narrow scope of medical conditions that qualify a patient for access to\nmedical cannabis. The breakdown of this market estimate by state is shown in the following chart.\n2017 U.S. State-Legal Cannabis Market Estimate\nOther States\n$1.9 B\n$8.0B\nCalifornia\n$3.2 B\nColorado\n$1.5 B\nOregon\n$470 M\nWashington\n$929 M\nSource: Ackrell Capital\nU.S. Federal Law\nCurrent federal law effectively prohibits all cannabis use and all commercial cannabis activity in the\nUnited States. Producing, selling and possessing cannabis are federal crimes. No cannabis-derived drug\nhas ever been federally approved for use in treating any medical condition. Otherwise legitimate business\ntransactions conducted by cannabis companies —and their banks, for those who can access banking\nservices—are legally suspect. Certain intellectual property and bankruptcy protections critical to\nmany U.S. businesses are not available to cannabis companies. Cannabis companies pay federal income\ntax at effective rates significantly higher than other businesses.\nDespite official prohibition, however, federal policies and laws recently passed by Congress have\ncarved out a limited space in which the state-legal cannabis industry has managed to thrive. Enforcement\npolicies published by the U.S. Department of Justice have unofficially invited cannabis business\nto proceed if certain conditions are respected. The U.S. Department of the Treasury established reporting\npolicies that create room for banks to service the cannabis industry. Federal budget legislation\n4 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER I\nExecutive Summary\nhas prevented allocated funds from being used to prosecute conduct that complies with state medical\ncannabis laws. And recent developments indicate the federal government may be pursuing policies and\npractices that create space for cannabis research and approval of cannabis-derived drugs.\nThe following chart shows three general areas of federal law that impact the cannabis industry—food\nand drug regulation, banking and finance, and intellectual property—as well as specific\nlaws and federal policies related to each area.

How and when federal legalization occurs will impact other\nprimary drivers of the market, including the number of eligible consumers, penetration rates and\nconsumer spending. We predict six developments relating to federal legalization: (1) the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) will begin approving individual pharmaceutical-grade drugs derived\nfrom cannabis; (2) more states will adopt medical cannabis laws; (3) more states will adopt recreational\nlaws; (4) the FDA will adopt routine approval procedures for drugs with extracts of low-THC/\nhigh-CBD cannabis varieties; (5) the FDA will adopt routine approval procedures for drugs with\nextracts of high-THC cannabis varieties; and (6) cannabis parts and derivatives will be removed from\nthe CSA schedules (either incrementally, starting with CBD, or all at once) and will be fully legal\nfor medical and recreational purposes. (We expand on these predicted developments in Chapter IV,\nU.S. Legal Landscape.)\nWe do not predict that these developments necessarily will occur in the order presented. We do\nexpect some of them to develop in parallel, and none of them depends fundamentally on any other.\nFor example, Congress could cause development (6) at any time by passing legislation that removes\nPath to Federal Legalization\n1. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will\nbegin approving individual pharmaceuticalgrade\ndrugs derived from cannabis.\n2. More states will adopt medical cannabis\nlaws.\n3. More states will adopt recreational laws.\n4. The FDA will adopt routine approval\nprocedures for drugs with extracts of\nlow-THC/high-CBD cannabis varieties.\n5. The FDA will adopt routine approval\nprocedures for drugs with extracts of\nhigh-THC cannabis varieties.\n6. Cannabis parts and derivatives will be\nremoved from the CSA schedules and will\nbe fully legal for medical and recreational\npurposes.\ncannabis from the CSA schedules and establishes\na national framework for recreational and medical\ncannabis regulation. Developments (1) through (3)\nlargely reflect incremental developments within\nthe existing legal environment. We do not expect\ndevelopments (4), (5) or (6) to occur during the\ncurrent presidential term, but we believe that there\nis a reasonable chance development (4) could begin\nwithin the next five years and development (5)\ncould occur within two years thereafter. In total, we\nbelieve it could take up to 10 years or more before\nthe federal legalization process reaches development\n(6) and can nabis becomes fully legal under federal\nlaw. For our market estimates, we assume (i) development\n(4) begins in 2023, (ii) development (5)\nfollows two years thereafter and (iii) development\n(6) occurs by 2027 and cannabis becomes fully\nlegal in the United States.\nWe believe that federal legalization will trigger\nrapid growth in the U.S. market, propelled by interstate commerce, access to the federal banking system\nand acceleration of the cannabis-derived pharma ceuticals market. A change in the federal status of\ncannabis in the United States will not only drive U.S. market growth, but should provide a significant\ncatalyst to the market worldwide.\nThe following graph illustrates the timeline of our predicted developments and the estimated\nimpact on the U.S. legalized cannabis market. As discussed on page 175, readers are cautioned to not\nplace undue reliance on our predictions or estimates. Almost certainly, our predictions and estimates\nwill prove inaccurate in some respects.\n6 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER I\nExecutive Summary\nU.S. Legalized Cannabis Market\n$140,000\nPath to Federal Legalization\n70 M\n($ millions)\n$120,000\n$100,000\n$80,000\n$60,000\n$40,000\nFDA Approves Cannabis-Derived Pharmaceuticals\nMore States Adopt Medical Cannabis Laws\nMore States Adopt Recreational Laws\nFDA Routinely Approves CBD Drugs\nFDA Routinely Approves THC Drugs\nFederal Government Legalizes Cannabis\n60 M\n50 M\n40 M\n30 M\n20 M\nNumber of Consumers\n$20,000\n10 M\n$0\n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030\n0 M\nLegalized Cannabis Market Size\nConsumers\nSource:�Ackrell Capital. Assumes cannabis will be legalized federally by 2027. Cannabis may never be legalized federally in the United States.\nn To Watch in 2018\nWe believe that the following events will impact the legalized\ncannabis industry in 2018.\nIncreasing Recreational Legalization\nWe expect 2018 will be a watershed year for recreational\nmarkets, both in the United States and internationally. California\nwill begin implementing its new recreational law in\nJanuary 2018, and Canada’s proposed recreational law is\nwidely expected to be approved in some form by mid-2018.\nCalifornia, which has a population of 38 million people\nand receives 250 million visitors annually, is poised to transition\nfrom the world’s largest medical cannabis market to\nthe largest recreational market with the implementation of\nits recreational law in January 2018.\nIn each of the three largest U.S. states to implement recreational\nlaws—Colorado, Oregon and Washington—the\nTo Watch in 2018\n• Increasing Recreational\nLegalization\n• Cannabis Consumer Experience\ngoes “Mainstream”\n• FDA Approval of Cannabis-\nDerived Pharmaceuticals\n• Commoditization of\nCannabis Flower\n• Access to Banking Services for\nU.S. Cannabis Companies\n• Increasing Strategic Investor\nActivity; Continuing Funding\nGap\nsize of the legalized cannabis market expanded significantly, doubling the size of the overall market in\neach of these states in the first full calendar year after implementation. The world has yet to experience\na legalized recreational cannabis market in a jurisdiction as large as California, and how the supply\nchain, consumer response and regulatory framework will coalesce in such a market remains to be seen.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 7\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nNonetheless, we believe that California’s state-legal market may double from an estimated $3.2 billion\nin 2017 to approximately $6.5 billion in 2018.\nCanada has assumed the role of a global leader of cannabis legalization. Although Canada’s legal\ncannabis market is presently limited to medical cannabis, it is currently the largest federally legal cannabis\nmarket in the world, estimated at $1.5 billion in 2017. In April 2017, a proposed recreational\nlaw was introduced in the Canadian parliament; the proposed Cannabis Act would allow adults to purchase\ncannabis from federally licensed producers and to possess and share cannabis with other adults.\nThe Cannabis Act is widely expected to be approved in some form by the Canadian parliament by mid-\n2018. If approved, Canada would be the largest country in the world to legalize recreational cannabis\non a national level, and we believe that the implementation of the Cannabis Act would significantly\nexpand the size of Canada’s overall market. Canada has demonstrated that by providing a national\nlegal framework for cannabis, companies operating legally within the industry have had a clear “first to\nmarket” advantage, allowing them to raise significant amounts of capital and to pursue domestic and\ninternational expansion opportunities.\nIf these recreational laws stimulate demand, as expected, and are otherwise viewed as successful, we\nexpect more U.S. states and additional countries to follow suit with similar laws. In the United States,\nlegislatures in eight states (Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island and\nVermont) are expected to introduce ballot measures or explore regulatory frameworks for recreational\ncannabis in 2018.\nCannabis Consumer Experience Goes “Mainstream”\nCannabis consumer product companies and retailers are rapidly evolving to meet the needs of the\n“mainstream” cannabis consumer. Cannabis consumers are no longer limited to smoking flower with\njoints, pipes or bongs, but have their choice of an increasing variety of products, including concentrates,\ninfused products and topicals. Products coming to market increasingly address the attributes\ndemanded by the modern consumer—greater discretion, ease of use, product safety and accurate\ndosing. To attract more mainstream customers, companies have responded to these demands with\nincreasingly sophisticated packaging and advertising.\nWhere a consumer purchases a product can be as important as the product itself. In the United\nStates, cannabis dispensaries play a critical role by providing consumers with access to a wide variety\nof products and “high-touch” education and sales services. Merchandising and branding have become\nmore prominent as dispensaries increasingly seek to provide consumers with an experience similar to\nother mainstream retail shopping experiences. In 2018, we see an opportunity for cannabis dispensaries\nto drive consumer penetration and mainstream acceptance of cannabis by establishing storefronts in\nmalls and other high-profile retail locations.\nIn 2018, we believe that product innovation and advancements in cannabis varieties, concentrates,\ninfused products, vaporizing technology and cannabis-derived pharmaceutical products will drive\nconsumer adoption and spending. However, because numerous product categories have low barriers\nto entry, we expect a significant influx of cannabis brands that will aggressively compete for limited\ndisplay space in dispensaries. We also believe product differentiation and availability will be more\nprevalent in legalized cannabis markets and will drive consumer transition from illegal to legal markets.\n8 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER I\nExecutive Summary\n“Mainstream” Consumer Experience\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 9\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nFDA Approval of Cannabis-Derived Pharmaceuticals\nThe FDA’s first-ever approval of a cannabis-derived pharmaceutical may occur in 2018. The FDA\nhas previously approved several drugs with chemically synthesized cannabinoids or cannabinoid-like\ncompounds, but has never approved a drug derived from the cannabis plant. In October 2017,\nU.K.-based GW Pharmaceuticals submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for Epidiolex,\nan oral formulation of cannabis-derived cannabidiol, or CBD, intended to treat severe forms of\nchildhood epilepsy. (GW Pharmaceuticals also manufactures Sativex, a mouth spray used for treatment\nof spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis; it includes THC and CBD derived from cannabis. Sativex\nwas first approved for use in the United Kingdom in 2010, and has been approved for use in at least\n30 countries, but not in the United States.) If the FDA approves Epidiolex, such a precedent could\nbe followed by similar approvals in the United States for other cannabis-derived drugs and result in a\nsignificant increase in the medical use of cannabis by consumers.\nCommoditization of Cannabis Flower\nThe supply of cannabis in the United States has increased considerably with expanded state legalization.\nThis increase has started to dampen retail and wholesale prices in various markets. While retail\nprices vary across the country, an examination of the price per gram of cannabis flower, or “bud,” in\nthe three largest states to implement recreational laws—Colorado, Oregon and Washington—reveals\na downward trend. The following graph shows the average price per gram of cannabis flower in these\nthree states since the beginning of 2016.\nConsumer Pricing Trends: Cannabis Flower Price per Gram\n$8.00\n$7.50\n$7.00\n$6.50\n$6.00\n$5.50\n$5.00\nJan 16 Mar 16 May 16 Jul 16 Sep 16 Nov 16 Jan 17 Mar 17 May 17 Jul 17 Sep 17\nSource: BDS Analytics\n10 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER I\nExecutive Summary\nAs prices decline, we are starting to see closer price parity between state-legal and illegal markets\n(in the United States, cannabis is generally priced lower in illegal markets than in state-legal markets).\nWe believe that lower retail prices in state-legal markets will accelerate consumer transition from illegal\nto state-legal markets and drive increased overall penetration rates. However, state and local taxes will\ncontinue to impact pricing for cannabis products in state-legal cannabis markets, which will impede\nthe transition to legal markets.\nIn international markets, cannabis cultivators in South America, particularly in Colombia and\nUruguay, are expected to proceed with large-scale operations in 2018, with the anticipated supply of\ncannabis entering the market in late 2018 or early 2019. These operations are designed to produce output\nthat exceeds local demand, and South American countries are expected to export products to other\nlegal markets, such as Canada and Germany. As legal markets increasingly import cannabis products,\nwe anticipate downward-pricing pressure for cannabis in both the wholesale and retail markets. Cannabis\ncultivators in domestic markets that permit imports may be challenged by large, low-cost cannabis\nproducers in South America and elsewhere. While these dynamics are expected to impact international\ncannabis markets, they should not materially affect prices in the United States until the importation of\ncannabis products becomes legal under federal law.\nAccess to Banking Services for U.S. Cannabis Companies\nBecause most cannabis-related businesses in the United States violate federal law, most domestic financial\ninstitutions do not provide services to participants in the cannabis industry. Companies in the\ncannabis industry may not be able to open or maintain bank accounts or access other products and\nservices—such as credit facilities, payment processing and insurance coverage—typically provided by\ntraditional financial institutions. A lack of access to banking and other traditional financial products\nand services continues to impede the growth of the industry; it increases the time, effort and expense\nrelated to ongoing operations and increases risks associated with cash transactions and the use of alternative\nproducts and services.\nThe California State Treasurer’s Cannabis Banking Working Group—a panel convened by California\nState Treasurer John Chiang that includes representatives from the cannabis industry and financial\ninstitutions, and government tax collection, law enforcement and regulatory agencies—issued a report\nin November 2017 on the cannabis industry’s banking challenges. In the report, the State Treasurer’s\nOffice stated that the cannabis industry’s lack of access to banking services is one of the biggest threats\nto the success of the state’s recreational cannabis law, which is scheduled for implementation starting\nin January 2018.\nThe U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires financial institutions to file “suspicious activity reports”\n(SARs) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regarding customers engaged in\n“marijuana-related business.” From February 2014 through June 2017, FinCEN received a total of\n33,692 marijuana-related SAR filings from a total of 390 banks and credit unions (out of approximately\n11,500 depository institutions). The following graph based on FinCEN data shows the number\nof banks and credit unions making such filings. While the percentage of the total number of depository\ninstitutions serving the cannabis industry remains small, the growing number of depository institutions\nmaking SAR filings indicates that cannabis businesses increasingly are accessing the federal banking\nsystem despite federal law.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 11\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nDepository Institutions Making Marijuana-Related SAR Filings\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nQ2 2014 Q4 2014 Q2 2015 Q4 2015 Q2 2016 Q4 2016 Q2 2017\nBanks\nCredit Unions\nSource: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\nFinCEN has published guidance outlining how financial institutions can, consistent with their BSA\nobligations, provide services to marijuana-related businesses. However, this guidance does not provide\nfinancial institutions with a legal defense for any violation of federal law. Consequently, financial institutions\nwilling to serve the cannabis industry tend to be smaller institutions, such as credit unions and\nstate-chartered banks. “Big” banks generally do not serve, or are not willing to state publicly that they\nserve, the cannabis industry. For example, according to American Banker, a spokeswoman for Wells\nFargo Bank recently said the bank’s policy worldwide is to not bank marijuana businesses.\nHowever, as cannabis-related companies increasingly participate in the formal U.S. economy, the\nnotion of what constitutes a “marijuana-related business” is being blurred, and banks are finding it\nmore difficult to institute and follow their own policies. For example, it may be straightforward for a\nbank to identify and refuse to transact with a cannabis cultivator, but the bank may be unsure whether\nit can provide services to (or whether it is providing services to) the cultivator’s accountant, landlord or\ninvestors. For example, Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ), a large beverage company, recently\ninvested approximately $190 million in Canopy Growth Corporation (TSX: WEED), a Canadian\ncannabis company. According to public filings, Constellation Brands has credit agreements with a\nnumber of large financial institutions, including Bank of America, Bank of the West, Fifth Third Bank,\nGoldman Sachs Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, PNC Bank, SunTrust Bank and Wells Fargo Bank. How\nthese institutions respond to the investment by Constellation Brands and other similar transactions\nmay indicate how large financial institutions will interact with the industry in the foreseeable future.\nIn the current environment, we believe more financial institutions will start to provide some level of\nservice to the cannabis industry. We also agree with the view of the California State Treasurer’s Office,\nas expressed in the working group’s report, that it is only a matter of time until cannabis businesses\nhave normal access to banking services. However, if the U.S. federal government were to change its\n12 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER I\nExecutive Summary\ncurrent practice and aggressively enforce existing federal cannabis laws, including penalizing financial\ninstitutions for serving the cannabis industry, it would have a dampening effect on the industry both\nin the United States and abroad.\nIncreasing Strategic Investor Activity; Continuing Funding Gap\nWe share the belief held by many that, ultimately, established companies from analogous indus -\ntries—alco hol, pharmaceutical, tobacco and consumer products—will enter the cannabis industry\nthrough minority investment, by acquisition or otherwise. We have already seen examples: Constellation\nBrands’ investment in Canopy Growth referenced above and the more than $400 million spent by\nThe Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE: SMG) to acquire soil, fertilizer, hydroponic equipment and\nlighting companies that supply the cannabis industry. These types of transactions help validate investor\nenthusiasm for and valuations in the cannabis industry, and we expect similar transactions to occur\nwith increasing frequency during 2018 and beyond.\nRetail investors and an increasing number of family office and strategic investors are providing most\nof the investment capital to the cannabis industry. Cannabis-related companies raised more than $2.0\nbillion in the public and private markets in 2017, but many of the financings were small—less than $5\nmillion. We expect that many institutional investors (most notably, the traditional venture capital and\nprivate equity communities) will not invest in the industry until it matures and the legal environment\nbecomes more favorable.\nWithout institutional support for the cannabis industry, a funding gap exists—companies are seeking\nmore capital than investors are willing or able to provide. We believe that this is especially true in\nthe private markets, where many companies struggle to raise necessary financing. Although capital may\nbe available for select issuers in both public and private markets, we believe that without participation\nfrom institutional investors, the cannabis industry will continue to face a significant funding gap for\nthe foreseeable future.\nn Investment Outlook\nHundreds, if not thousands, of cannabis-related companies are seeking to raise capital—thus presenting\ninvestment opportunities for sophisticated investors who want to participate in the cannabis\nindustry. Investors have their choice of investing in the more than 300 publicly traded cannabis-related\ncompanies, or in the significant number of private companies raising capital. Investors may also choose\namong stock markets (both within the United States and internationally), type of security (equity\nversus debt) and type of company (companies across all segments of the industry are raising capital).\nMost of the cannabis-related companies raising capital—even publicly traded companies—are in\nearly stages of development, have de minimis revenue and are not profitable. More than 85% of publicly\ntraded cannabis-related companies have annual revenue less than $5 million, and less than 5%\nhave annual revenue greater than $25 million.\nTo help investors better evaluate investment opportunities in the cannabis industry, we currently\ndefine five primary segments: production, distribution, consumer products, business solutions and\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 13\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\ndigital media. We further divide each segment into multiple subsegments. Each segment has unique\nopportunities and risks. For example, companies that possess, manufacture or distribute cannabis\n(commonly known as “touching the plant”) face risks related to violating federal law—and state-law\ncompliance obligations— not generally faced by providers of business software or digital media content.\nMany businesses operate in multiple segments, and we expect industry leaders to emerge in each\nsegment. The five primary segments and their subsegments are illustrated in the following chart.\nCannabis Industry Segments\nProduction\nBusiness Solutions\nCultivation\nProduction\nEquipment and\nSupplies\nProduction and\nTesting Services\nBusiness\nSoftware\nBusiness\nServices\nDistribution\nDigital Media\nDispensaries\nE-Commerce\nDistribution\nServices\nOnline Content\nand Networking\nOnline\nDirectories\nConsumer Products\nVaporizers and\nFlower Concentrates Infused Products Pharmaceuticals\nAccessories\nInvolves “touching the plant”\nDoes not involve “touching the plant”\nIn our view, valuations and stock price fluctuations in the cannabis industry continue to be driven\nmore by expectations for the cannabis industry in general than by individual company fundamentals.\nToday, in the public markets for cannabis-related companies, trading volumes are too low, trading\nprices are too volatile and operating histories are too limited to place any reliance on current valuation\nlevels. We believe that this dynamic will continue until cannabis-related companies have matured and\nstart to realize meaningful revenue, profitability and other financial metrics that will allow investors to\nevaluate companies within the industry by more traditional methodology.\nIt is still too early to know how the cannabis industry or its sectors will be valued in the future. It\nmay come to pass that companies in the cannabis industry are valued comparably to public companies\nin industries with similar characteristics, such as the alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceutical and consumer\nproducts industries, especially as companies from those industries look to enter the cannabis industry,\nthrough acquisition or by other means. What is clear now, however, is that investors will continue\nto have a range of investment opportunities from which to choose in this rapidly growing, dynamic\nindustry.\n14 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER II\nCannabis Science 101\nn The Cannabis Plant\nCannabis is a genus of flowering plant indigenous to Eurasia. For millennia, humans have consumed\ncannabis for therapeutic, medicinal, social or spiritual purposes and have used the seeds and fibrous\nstalks of the cannabis plant to produce goods such as rope, paper, clothing and soap.\nThere are at least three principal cannabis species: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis\nruderalis. 1 These three species can be distinguished by their plant structures and leaves. Sativa plants are\ngenerally tall, thin and wispy; indica plants tend to be shorter and bushier than sativa plants; and ruderalis\nplants are shaggy and the shortest of all three species. The following pictures depict the Cannabis\nsativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis plants and their leaves.\nCannabis Sativa Plant Cannabis Indica Plant Cannabis Ruderalis Plant\n1\nBotanists disagree about whether sativa, indica and ruderalis are distinct species or are instead distinct subspecies of a single plant\nspecies. Some botanists propose renaming these three species to reflect their geographic origins. This report takes no position on\nthese botanical debates; it merely adopts one set of commonly used nomenclature.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 15\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nCannabis Sativa Leaf Cannabis Indica Leaf Cannabis Ruderalis Leaf\nMany hybrid varieties of cannabis—sometimes referred to as strains—have developed from these three\nspecies, both through selective breeding and in the wild. Most cannabis varieties grown today are hybrids\nthat exhibit features of two or more of these principal species. Cannabis varieties consumed for physio -\nlogical effects generally are hybrids of sativa and indica that produce relatively large and dense flowers.\nCertain cannabis varieties—known as hemp—that are grown to produce industrial goods generally\nare sativa-dominant varieties or hybrids of sativa and ruderalis that produce relatively small and sparse\nflowers.\nCannabis yields more than 100 different compounds known as “cannabinoids,” which, when consumed,\nact on cannabinoid receptors in cells in the human nervous and immune systems. The primary\ncannabinoid in most cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive compound responsible\nfor the “high” or euphoric feeling commonly associated with cannabis consumption. The next\nmost abundant cannabinoid is cannabidiol, or CBD, which produces a physical effect without the\npsychoactive effects associated with THC.\nCannabis also includes a variety of compounds known as “terpenes,” which are understood to\ninteract with cannabinoids to produce some of the physiological effects sought by cannabis consumers.\nTerpenes are present in cannabis and many other types of plants and are responsible for a plant’s aroma\nand flavor. Examples of terpenes found in cannabis include limonene, which is known for its citrus\nsmell and is also present in citrus fruit rinds, and pinene, which is known for its pine and fir aromas\nand is also found in pine resin.\nThe highest concentrations of cannabinoids and terpenes are found in the “trichomes” on the\nflowers of unpollinated female cannabis plants. Trichomes are crystalline or hairlike components that\nsecrete cannabinoids, terpenes and other compounds; they generally occur all over the cannabis plant\nbut are found in highest concentration on the flower. The following illustration shows the basic anatomy\nof a cannabis plant, and the images to the right show a female cannabis plant flower and a close-up\nview of trichomes.\n16 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER II Cannabis Science 101\nCannabis Flower\nTrichomes\nCannabis Plant Anatomy\nCannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways that introduce its active compounds into the body:\nsmoking cannabis flower or its extracts, vaporizing cannabis flower or its extracts, ingesting cannabis\nextracts or food products prepared with cannabis and topical application of cannabis products. Human\nconsumption of cannabinoids and terpenes is widely believed to have numerous medicinal benefits and\ntherapeutic applications. Depending on the types and relative concentrations of the cannabinoids and\nterpenes consumed, these benefits may include pain relief, reduction of inflammation, and promotion\nof an energetic, uplifting mood or a calm, relaxed mood.\nAlthough humans have used cannabis therapeutically for thousands of years, only recently have\nscientists begun to research and understand at the chemical and biological levels how cannabis works\nwith the human body. In the 1940s, the American organic chemist Roger Adams performed numerous\nstudies on cannabis and identified and isolated the cannabinoids THC, CBD and cannabinol, or\nCBN. In the 1960s, a team of scientists led by Raphael Mechoulam at the Weizmann Institute of\nScience in Israel more completely determined the chemical composition of THC, CBD and certain\nother cannabinoids. This research on cannabinoids ultimately led to the discovery that the human\nbody naturally produces its own cannabinoids and uses them to regulate homeostasis (a process by\nwhich biological systems tend to maintain internal stability, or balance).\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 17\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nn The Human Endocannabinoid System\nThe human endocannabinoid system consists of nervous and immune system receptors involved in\nregulating health and physiological functions. There are two types of endocannabinoid receptors, CB1\nand CB2 receptors, which are located in the brain and in other organs, tissues and glands throughout\nthe human body. The human body actively regulates variables related to appetite, immune response,\nmemory, mood, pain, sleep and other functions by naturally creating compounds known as “endocannabinoids”\nand delivering them to these receptors. The following illustration depicts the human\nendocannabinoid system and the location of CB1 and CB2 receptors.\nHuman Endocannabinoid System\nCB1 Receptors\nCB2 Receptors\nImmune Cells\nCB1\nBrain\nLungs\nVascular system\nMuscles\nGastrointestinal tract\nReproductive organs\nCB2\nSpleen\nBones\nSkin\nGlial cells\nCB1 and CB2\nImmune system\nLiver\nBone marrow\nPancreas\nBrain stem\nThe physiological effects of cannabis consumption are believed to be primarily the result of THC,\nCBD and other cannabinoids bonding with the body’s endocannabinoid receptors and the consequent\nimpact on functions regulated by the endocannabinoid system. As scientists gain a deeper understanding\nof the human endocannabinoid system, they are beginning to explore the application of cannabinoids\nto a broad range of medical conditions and ailments. Although medical research on cannabinoids\nis nascent, cannabis is currently being used to manage many conditions, including anxiety, depression,\ninflammation, insomnia, nausea, neural disorders and pain.\nCB1 and CB2 Receptors\nCB1 and CB2 endocannabinoid receptors, which are found on cell surfaces throughout the body, are\nbelieved to be more numerous than any other cellular receptor signaling system in the human body.\nThe CB1 receptors are located primarily in the brain, central nervous system and other tissues; these\nreceptors play a modulatory role in memory, mood, sleep, appetite and pain sensation. The CB2 recep-\n18 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER II Cannabis Science 101\ntors are located primarily in peripheral organs associated with the immune system, with the greatest\nconcentration in the spleen, and are responsible for managing inflammation and autoimmune function.\nMany tissues contain both CB1 and CB2 receptors, with each receptor type linked to a different\nphysiological function.\nHuman Endocannabinoids\nEndocannabinoids are the cannabinoids created naturally by the human body for delivery to CB1 and\nCB2 receptors. In contrast with cannabinoids introduced through cannabis consumption, endocannabinoids\nare broken down quickly by the body and cause effects with shorter durations. One wellstudied\nendocannabinoid is anandamide (AEA). AEA is associated with the maintenance of mood,\nand AEA deficiency is understood to be anxiogenic (anxiety-inducing). Maintaining appropriate AEA\nlevels within the human body is believed to reduce pain and inflammation, counter the proliferation\nof cancer cells, relieve anxiety and promote adult neurogenesis (a process whereby nerve cells are generated\nfrom neural stem cells). Like THC, AEA has a small molecular structure that binds to CB1 receptors.\nAEA is currently being studied for its effects on angiogenesis (the process of developing new blood\nvessels), anxiety, cancer and memory consolidation. AEA is also present outside the human body; for\nexample, it is a natural component of chocolate.\nEndocannabinoid Systems in Animals\nNonhuman mammals, including dogs, cats and horses, have been shown to have endocannabinoid\nsystems that are similar to their human counterparts: these systems employ CB1 and CB2 receptors\nand function through the natural production of endocannabinoids. This implies that the endocannabinoid\nsystem is not a recent evolutionary development, but rather an ancient physiological feature of\nmammals in general. The cannabinoids found in cannabis, particularly CBD, have been shown to have\na range of therapeutic applications for certain animals, including antibacterial and anti-inflammatory\nproperties, appetite and bone-growth stimulation, and pain relief. The following chart depicts the\ncanine endocannabinoid system and CB1 and CB2 receptors.\nCanine Endocannabinoid System\nCB1\nCB2\nCB1 and CB2\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 19\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nn Cannabinoids\nCannabinoids are compounds present in the cannabis plant that act on human cannabinoid receptors\nin cells in the nervous and immune systems. Scientists have identified more than 100 cannabinoids in\nthe cannabis plant. Generally, the most abundant cannabinoid is THC, a psychoactive compound that\ncauses a euphoric “high,” and the second most abundant cannabinoid is cannabidiol, or CBD, which\nproduces a relaxing physical effect without a psychoactive effect. Consuming cannabinoids has been\nshown to have numerous medicinal benefits and therapeutic applications. The following table lists\n20 common conditions for which medical cannabis use has been legalized under U.S. state laws and\nidentifies 8 cannabinoids that are used or being studied to treat these conditions. A brief description of\nthese cannabinoids follows the table.\nCommon Qualifying Medical Conditions and Potentially Therapeutic Cannabinoids\nTHC CBD CBC CBG CBGA CBN THCA CBDA\nAlzheimer's disease � �\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) � � �\nAnorexia\n�\nArthritis � �\nCachexia � �\nCancer � � � � � �\nChronic pain � � � � � �\nCrohn's disease\n�\nEpilepsy\n�\nGlaucoma � � �\nHepatitis C � �\nHIV/AIDS � �\nInflammation � � � � � �\nMigraine � �\nMultiple sclerosis\n�\nNausea � � �\nNervous system degeneration �\nParkinson's disease\n�\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) � �\nSpasms � � � �\nTHC Tetrahydrocannabinol: THC refers to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and certain chemical\nvariants, including delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol. THC is the most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis\nand is understood to be the psychoactive compound in cannabis primarily responsible for the euphoric\nfeeling of being “high.” Both recreational and medicinal users often seek the psychoactive effects of\nTHC and may prefer certain cannabis products based solely on the quality and level of THC. THC\nis believed to have wide-ranging medicinal benefits: analgesic, antianxiety, antibacterial, anticancer,\n20 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER II Cannabis Science 101\nantidepressant, antiemetic, anti-inflammatory, antinausea and antispasmodic. It also is believed to have\ntherapeutic applications, such as appetite stimulation, bronchodilation, neuroprotection and pain relief.\nCBD Cannabidiol: CBD is considered to be the second most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis.\nIt is nonpsychoactive and is believed to counteract the psychoactive effects of THC. CBD also is\nbelieved to have wide-ranging medicinal benefits: analgesic, antianxiety, antibacterial, anticancer, anticonvulsant,\nantidepressant, antiemetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-insomnia, anti-ischemic, antipsychotic\nand antispasmodic. In addition, CBD is believed to have therapeutic applications, including appetite\nstimulation, bone-growth stimulation, immunosuppression and neuroprotection. CBD can be derived\nfrom many cannabis strains, including low-THC strains ordinarily grown to produce industrial hemp\nproducts.\nCBC Cannabichromene: CBC is thought to be the third most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis\nand is nonpsychoactive. Like THC and CBD, CBC is believed to have several medicinal benefits,\nincluding analgesic, antibacterial, anticancer, antidepressant, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and\nanti-insomnia. CBC is also used as a therapeutic bone-growth stimulant. Ongoing research seeks to\ndetermine the role of CBC in reducing gastrointestinal inflammation. CBC may also have applications\nin pain management—in addition to binding to the CB1 and CB2 endocannabinoid receptors, it has\nbeen shown to interact with certain pain receptors.\nCBG Cannabigerol: CBG is nonpsychoactive and is believed to have several medicinal benefits—\nanalgesic, antibacterial, anticancer, antidepressant and antifungal—as well as a therapeutic application\nfor bone-growth stimulation. CBG is present primarily during the early stages of the cannabis plant’s\ngrowth cycle; only small amounts can be extracted from the plant during its flowering stage (although\nstrains of cannabis have recently been bred to have high levels of CBG). CBG is believed to partially\ncounteract the psychoactive effects of THC and to decrease anxiety and muscle tension.\nCBGA Cannabigerolic Acid: CBGA is a nonpsychoactive precursor to all other cannabinoids,\nincluding THC, CBD, CBC and CBG. Much of a cannabis plant’s CBGA ultimately transforms into\nother cannabinoids through the chemical process of decarboxylation. CBGA is used for analgesic and\nanti-inflammatory applications. Certain cannabis strains cultivated to produce industrial hemp products\nare believed to contain high levels of CBG relative to other strains.\nCBN Cannabinol: CBN has been shown to produce some psychoactive effects and is believed to\nhave several medicinal benefits, such as analgesic, antibacterial, anticonvulsive, anti-inflammatory and\nanti-insomnia. Unlike many other cannabinoids, CBN is not derived directly from CBGA decarboxylation;\ninstead, it results from THC degradation. The CBN level of a cannabis plant is sometimes used\nas a measure of the plant’s overall quality for consumption.\nTHCA Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinolic Acid: THCA is found abundantly in raw cannabis flower\nand is the precursor to THC. THCA is nonpsychoactive and is believed to have several medicinal\nbenefits, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic. THCA decarboxylates into THC\nthrough drying or application of intense heat, such as the heat applied during smoking or vaporizing\nthe cannabis plant.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 21\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nCBDA Cannabidiolic Acid: CBDA, the precursor to CBD, is nonpsychoactive and is believed to\nhave several medicinal benefits— anticancer, antiemetic and anti-inflammatory—as well as therapeutic\napplications. Generally, CBDA is present in the cannabis plant in low levels, although recently some\nstrains have been grown with CBDA levels comparable to typical THC levels. Like THCA, CBDA\ndecarboxylates into other compounds when heated. (An explanation of decarboxylation follows.)\nCannabinoid Composition Levels\nAs a general rule, THC and CBD are the most prevalent cannabinoids found in many strains of the\ncannabis plant, with other cannabinoids appearing in relatively minuscule amounts. (One exception\nto this rule is the low-THC strains grown to produce industrial hemp.) THC-dominant strains historically\nhave been the most popular with cannabis consumers, but CBD-dominant strains and strains\nwith high levels of other cannabinoids are believed to have medicinal benefits and hold promise for\ntherapeutic applications.\nCannabinoid Creation: Decarboxylation\nAll cannabinoids present in cannabis begin as cannabigerolic acid, or CBGA. CBGA is ultimately\ntransformed into various other cannabinoids through decarboxylation, a process by which a compound’s\nchemical structure changes due to light, heat, alkaline conditions or other chemical forces. The\ntwo main catalysts for decarboxylation of CBGA and other cannabinoids are heat and time (the aging\nprocess). The following chart depicts the process of cannabinoid decarboxylation.\nCannabinoid Decarboxylation Process\nRAW\nCBGA\nTHCA\nCBCA\nCBDA\nTHCVA\nCBCVA\nCBDVA\nHEATED\nTHC CBC CBD CBG\nTHCV\nCBCV\nCBDV\nCBGV\nAGED\nCBNA\n8 - THC CBN CBL CBLA\nSource: Elemental Wellness\n22 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER II Cannabis Science 101\nAs examples of the decarboxylation process, consider the changes to THCA that result from heat\nand aging. If the nonpsychoactive THCA naturally present in raw cannabis is heated, it quickly decarboxylates\ninto psychoactive THC; this is what commonly occurs when cannabis flower is smoked or\nvaporized for its psychoactive effect. THCA may also be stored and aged to produce CBN.\nCannabinoid Boiling Points\nCannabinoids boil at temperatures lower than the temperature at which cannabis flower burns. Based\non this property, vaporizers have been developed to heat cannabis flower to a point at which its active\ncompounds boil and can be inhaled as vapor but at which point the flower does not combust and create\nsmoke. The approximate temperatures at which select cannabinoids boil and cannabis flower combusts\nare shown in the following table.\nCompound Boiling and\nFlower Combustion Temperatures\nCompound/Flower\nTHCA\nCBDA\nTHC\nCBD\nCBN\nFlower\nTemperature (°F)\n220\n250\n315\n355\n365\n450\nSmoking cannabis flower remains the most popular form of cannabis consumption, even though\nit is believed to destroy as much as 30% of the active cannabinoids and is less efficient than merely\nheating the desired compounds to their boiling points. Vaporizers are becoming increasingly sophisticated,\nand those that can maintain temperatures which target the activation of specific cannabinoids\nare becoming popular.\nn Terpenes\nTerpenes are a class of organic compounds present in cannabis and\nmany other plants; they are responsible for a plant’s aroma and flavor.\nThe strong odors produced by terpenes are believed to be part of the\nnatural defense of many plants. Cannabis contains more than 100 different\nterpenes, which are believed to interact with cannabinoids in a\nway that contributes to the medicinal benefits and therapeutic applications\nof cannabis. Like cannabinoids, terpenes are present in highest\nconcentration in the flowers of cannabis plants. (Terpenoids are certain\nchemical variants of terpenes, and this report uses the general term\n“terpene” to refer to both terpenes and terpenoids.)\nTerpenes are believed to interact in various ways with the human\nphysiology: by acting on receptors and neurotransmitters, combining\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 23\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nor dissolving with fats, inhibiting serotonin uptake and increasing dopamine activity in the brain. Scientists\nhave yet to develop an extensive and detailed understanding of the mechanisms and effects of\nmany terpenes. However, consumption of certain cannabis strains with particular terpene profiles and\ncorresponding aromas are generally associated with certain experiences. For example, cannabis strains\nthat smell of musk or clove (indicating the presence of myrcene) tend to cause sedative and relaxing\neffects, strains with a piney scent (indicating the presence of pinene) are used to promote focus and\nmemory retention, and strains with a lemony scent (indicating the presence of limonene) are consumed\nfor mood uplift.\nThe following table identifies eight terpenes found in cannabis and lists the medicinal benefits and\ntherapeutic applications commonly associated with each.\nPotential Medicinal Benefits and Therapeutic Applications of Notable Terpenes\nAntianxiety\nAntibacterial\nAnticancer\nAnticonvulsive\nAntidepressant\nAntifungal\nAnti-inflammatory\nAnti-insomnia\nAnti-ischemic\nAntiseptic\nAntitumor\nAppetite suppressant\nBronchodilator\nCamphene\n�\n�\n�\n�\nCaryophyllene Humulene Limonene Linalool Myrcene Pinene Terpinolene\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n��\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\nCamphene: Camphene smells strongly of damp woodlands and fir needles and is believed to have\nseveral medicinal benefits , such as antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory, and a therapeutic\napplication as a bronchodilator.

Caryophyllene is found in many plants, including Thai basil,\ncloves, cinnamon leaves and black pepper.\nHumulene: Humulene is well known for giving beer its hoppy aroma and is believed to have several\nmedicinal benefits: antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antitumor. Humulene is used to aid weight\nloss by acting as an anorectic (appetite suppressant). It is also found in hops and coriander.\nLimonene: Limonene is recognized for its citrusy smell. Its medicinal benefits are believed to include\nantianxiety, antibacterial, anticancer, anticonvulsive, antidepressant and antifungal. Limonene present\nin cannabis quickly enters the bloodstream upon inhalation, which may facilitate the quick absorption\nof other terpenes and thus contribute to an uplifting experience. Limonene is also present in citrus fruit\nrinds, rosemary, juniper, peppermint and pine needle oils, and its strong smell serves as a natural insect\nrepellent.\nLinalool: Linalool has floral and lavender aromas. It is believed to have medicinal benefits that\ninclude antibacterial, antidepressant, antifungal and anti-insomnia. Linalool may also counteract anxiety\ninduced by THC consumption. Some research suggests that linalool may boost the immune system,\nreduce lung inflammation and restore cognitive and emotional function (potentially making it\nuseful in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease). Linalool is found naturally in hundreds of plants and is\na common ingredient in bath products.\nMyrcene: Myrcene is generally the most abundant terpene found in cannabis and is known for its\nmusky and earthy herbal smell, comparable to the smell of cloves. Myrcene is believed to have several\nmedicinal benefits, including antibacterial, anticancer, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and antiseptic.\nMyrcene is understood to enable and hasten the psychoactive effect of THC by lowering resistance\nposed by the blood-brain barrier and increasing the THC saturation capacity of the CB1 receptors.\nConsuming cannabis with high levels of myrcene may contribute to sedative and relaxing effects suitable\nfor the treatment of insomnia and pain. Myrcene is present in hops, citrus fruits, bay leaves, eucalyptus,\nwild thyme, lemongrass and many other plants.\nPinene: Pinene is known for its pine and fir aromas and is believed to have medicinal benefits, such\nas antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory, and a therapeutic application as a broncho dilator.\nPinene has shown potential to function as an anticancer agent and is believed to counter some of the\npsychoactive effects of THC. Pinene is present in conifers, pine resin and citrus fruits and is one of the\nterpenes most prevalent in nature.\nTerpinolene: Terpinolene has a piney aroma and subtle herbal and sweet floral scents similar to\ncitrus fruits. Terpinolene is believed to have medicinal benefits, including antibacterial, antifungal,\nanti-insomnia and antiseptic. It is also thought to be a central nervous system depressant and is used\nto induce sleep or reduce psychological distress. Terpinolene is found in sage and rosemary and is used\nin soaps and perfumes.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 25\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nCannabis Plant Terpene Profile\nMyrcene is the most abundant terpene found in many cannabis strains, and other terpenes are generally\npresent in lesser, varying amounts.

Cannabis strains with specific THC to CBD ratios are currently\nthe predominant focus for therapeutic applications. THC to CBD ratios in strains popular for treating\ncertain medical conditions generally range from 100:1 through 1:100, as illustrated by the following\nchart.\n26 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER II Cannabis Science 101\nTHC and CBD Formulation Spectrum\nTHC Dominant Balanced CBD Dominant\nTHC:CBD\n25:1 to 100:1\nTHC:CBD\n10:1 to 25:1\nTHC:CBD\n5:1 to 10:1\nTHC:CBD\n4:1\nTHC:CBD\n1:4\nTHC:CBD\n1:5 to 1:10\nTHC:CBD\n1:10 to 1:25\nTHC:CBD\n1:25 to 1:100\nTHC Level\nCBD Level\n• Alzheimer’s disease\n• Anorexia\n• Appetite stimulant\n• Chronic pain\n• Amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis (ALS)\n• Cachexia\n• Cancer\n• Glaucoma\n• Hepatitis C\n• HIV/AIDS\n• Migraine\n• Multiple sclerosis\n• Nausea\n• Spasms\n• Anxiety\n• Epilepsy\n• Depression\n• Inflammation\n• Nervous system degeneration\n• Parkinson’s disease\n• Post-traumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD)\n1:100\nThe “entourage effect” refers to the overall user experience produced by the interactions among all\nactive compounds in the cannabis plant. The various cannabinoids and terpenes in a particular cannabis\nplant are believed to work synergistically with each other and with the human endocannabinoid\nsystem to create an effect very different from the effect any one compound would create. This phenomenon\nmay partially explain why different cannabis strains are used to treat diverse medical conditions.\nThere are several generally accepted examples of the entourage effect. CBD is believed to regulate\nthe psychoactive effects of THC and reduce short-term memory loss, sleepiness and paranoia that may\nbe caused by THC. Myrcene is understood to enable and hasten the psychoactive effect of THC by\nlowering resistance posed by the blood-brain barrier and increasing the THC saturation capacity of the\nCB1 receptors. Other terpenes have been shown to block endocannabinoid receptors in the brain while\npromoting bonding by endocannabinoid receptors located elsewhere in the body.\nMany cannabinoid and terpene formulations developed for therapeutic applications are created\nby combining extracts from multiple cannabis strains, a process known as “Frankensteining.” Some\nbelieve Frankenstein formulations are less effective than formulations developed from a single strain\nbecause the natural balance of compounds in a single strain translates to a naturally balanced effect on\nthe human body.\nAn understanding of entourage effects and how to effectively combine cannabinoids and terpenes\nis believed to be critical to the development of targeted cannabis therapies. Examples of cannabis-based\ntherapies being developed with specific cannabinoid-terpene profiles include acne medication containing\nCBD and limonene, linalool and pinene; antiseptic agents containing CBG and pinene; treatments\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 27\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nfor social anxiety disorders containing CBD, limonene and linalool; and sleeping medicines combining\nCBD, THC, caryophyllene, linalool and myrcene.\nGenetics and Propagation\nSelective breeding and other botanical techniques are being used to develop cannabis varieties with\ndesired profiles of compounds, and scientists are developing tools to synthesize isolated cannabinoids\nin laboratory settings in order to study cannabis at the genetic level. For example, the first mapping\nof a cannabis genome was completed in 2011 by a team of Canadian botanists, led by Jon Page from\nthe National Research Council Canada and Timothy Hughes from the University of Toronto, who\nsequenced 30,000 genes in a sativa variety named “Purple Kush.”\nCannabis Genome\nGenetic copies, or “clones,” of cannabis plants are generally produced using two methods, “clone\nclipping” and micropropagation, or “tissue culture.” Clone clipping involves cutting a growing\ntip from a cannabis plant that is several inches long and inserting the cut tip into a grow -\ning medium, where it then grows into a new plant. Tissue culture involves taking a small tissue sample\n(which may even be a single cell) from a plant and growing it temporarily in a sterile nutri ent solution\nbefore transferring it to a permanent growing medium. Controlling cannabis plant genomes is\nexpected to be an important intellectual property issue in the cannabis industry (at least one U.S. patent\nhas been issued for a strain of cannabis).\n28 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER II Cannabis Science 101\nCannabis Plant Tissue Cultures\nSynthetic cannabinoids and terpenes can be manufactured by modifying plant-based compounds\nor through tools of synthetic biology and biocatalysis. For example, a synthetic version of THC\nknown as dronabinol is the active compound in the pharmaceutical product Marinol, which was\napproved by the FDA in 1985 for use in treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer\nchemotherapy. Methods for biosynthetic production of cannabinoids have been patented in the United\nStates. Some medical practitioners and cannabis users have found synthetic compounds to be less effective\nthan plant-based cannabinoids and have attributed this reduced efficacy to the lack of an entourage\neffect.\nDosage, Safety and Side Effects\nCannabis dosing schedules provided by doctors and producers generally lack scientific rigor and,\nalthough industry participants strive to create a reliable dosing framework, users generally determine\ndosage through self-titration and trial and error. (This method of dosing does not always lead to the\ndesired effect, but it is generally agreed that there is a low risk of death from an overdose of cannabis.)\nProduct packaging commonly indicates that a 10-mg serving of cannabinoids represents one dose,\nand servings of 2 mg to 5 mg are commonly characterized as “microdoses.” Examples of representative\ndosage amounts used to treat some common medical conditions are presented in the following table.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 29\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nRepresentative Dosage Amounts\nDesired Effect or Ailment\n“High”\nAnxiety, depression, spasms\nCancer\nChronic pain\nEpileptic seizures\nGlaucoma\nIncreased appetite\nMultiple sclerosis\nSchizophrenia\nSleep disorders\nDosage\n10 mg THC\n25 mg CBD\n25 mg CBD\n2.5–20 mg THC\n200–300 mg CBD\n20–40 mg CBD\n2.5 mg THC\n2.5–120 mg THC\n40–1,280 mg CBD\n40–160 mg CBD\nDosage Ratio\n(THC:CBD)\n10:1 to 100:1\n1:10\n1:1\n10:1\n1:5\n1:2 to 1:4\n5:1\n1:1\n1:4 to 1:128\n1:4 to 1:16\nNeither the potential medicinal benefits and therapeutic applications of cannabis consumption nor\nthe negative side effects of cannabis use have been thoroughly researched by medical science. Shortterm\nnegative side effects are believed by some to include sensory distortion, panic, anxiety, poor coordination\nof movement, reduced reaction time, lethargy or drowsiness, depression and elevated heart\nrate. Longer-term effects may include suppression of the immune system, growth disorders, destruction\nof lung fibers, brain lesions, reduced sexual capacity, difficulties with concentration, reduced ability\nto learn and retain information, and personality and mood changes. There is also an ongoing debate\nabout whether cannabis consumption may lead to the abuse of more harmful substances (the so-called\n“gateway drug” debate).\n30 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nThe nascent cannabis industry is often viewed by investors and others as a single, homogeneous industry,\nin much the same way the “technology” industry was viewed in the early 1990s. As the technology\nindustry became more important to the global economy and was better understood by the investment\ncommunity, however, investment banks and other industry analysts tracked an increasing number of\ndiscrete yet related industry segments. In the cannabis industry we are seeing a similar trend, which we\nexpect to continue as the industry evolves.\nTo help investors better evaluate investment opportunities in the cannabis industry, we currently\ndefine five primary segments: production, distribution, consumer products, business solutions and\ndigital media. We further divide each segment into multiple subsegments. Each segment has unique\nopportunities and risks. For example, companies that possess, manufacture or distribute cannabis\n(commonly known as “touching the plant”) face risks related to violating federal law—and state-law\ncompliance obligations— not generally faced by providers of business software or digital media content.\nMany businesses operate in multiple segments, and we expect industry leaders to emerge in each\nsegment. The five primary segments and their subsegments are illustrated in the following chart.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 31\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nCannabis Industry Segments\nProduction\nBusiness Solutions\nCultivation\nProduction\nEquipment and\nSupplies\nProduction and\nTesting Services\nBusiness\nSoftware\nBusiness\nServices\nDistribution\nDigital Media\nDispensaries\nE-Commerce\nDistribution\nServices\nOnline Content\nand Networking\nOnline\nDirectories\nConsumer Products\nVaporizers and\nFlower Concentrates Infused Products Pharmaceuticals\nAccessories\nInvolves “touching the plant”\nDoes not involve “touching the plant”\nn Production\nWe divide the production segment of the cannabis industry into three subsegments: cultivation, production\nequipment and supplies, and production and testing services. Cultivation involves operating\ngrow facilities, propagating cannabis strains, and harvesting and curing cannabis flower. Production\nequipment and supplies include the physical components used in production, such as extraction\nequipment, testing equipment, lighting, irrigation systems and plant nutrients. Production and testing\nservices include services that support production, such as extraction or packaging, as well as testing services\nrelated to product safety, composition and quality control. Each of these production subsegments\nis described in more detail in the following discussion.\nCultivation\nThe principal function of a cannabis cultivator is to produce cannabis plants and flowers with the\naromas, flavors, active compounds and overall quality demanded by consumers and production intermediaries.\nA cultivator can access hundreds of existing cannabis strains by purchasing seeds or clones\nfrom commercial seed banks or nurseries, or developing unique strains through selective breeding. A\ncultivator seeks to optimize the quality and quantity of a plant’s yield by managing cultivation input\nvariables such as light, air, nutrition, and drying and curing times.\nCannabis Cultivation Process\nOrdinarily, a period of three to ten months is required to grow and prepare cannabis flower for consumption.\nThe cultivation process generally can be organized into six phases: seed selection, seedling,\nvegetative, flowering, harvesting and curing. Each of these phases is summarized in the following table.\n32 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nCultivation Process Overview: Seed to Bud\nTime\nStart\nSeed Selection\nSelecting a seed is the first step of the cultivation process. A cultivator can\nchoose from more than 1,500 unique seed varieties, each of which has the\ncapacity to produce a cannabis strain with a particular cannabinoid and\nterpene profile and other unique characteristics.\n1–4\nWeeks\nSeedling\nThe seedling stage is the period during which the seed sprouts and the\nplant stem starts to grow. During this stage, cultivators manage growth to\navoid long stems that may lack the strength to support further vegetation.\n3–8\nWeeks\nVegetative\nThe vegetative stage is characterized by the plant’s rapid growth and revelation\nof sexual characteristics. During this stage, cultivators remove male\nplants and control growth inputs, such as light and nutrients, to maximize\nthe plant’s yield of unpollinated female flower (which generally contains\nthe highest concentration of active compounds).\n6–16\nWeeks\nFlowering\nThe flowering phase comprises the growth and maturation of the cannabis\nflower and the trichomes on the flower. Trichomes are hairlike components\nthat secrete cannabinoids, terpenes and other compounds. Trichomes generally\noccur all over the surface of the plant, but are found in highest concentration\non the flowers of unpollinated female plants.\n2–4\nWeeks\nHarvesting\nHarvesting involves clipping the leafstalks (on which the flowers grow)\nfrom the main plant stem, drying the leafstalks and flowers, and trimming\nthe dried flowers. Cultivators harvest at a time calculated to maximize\nflower yield and optimize cannabinoid and terpene content.\n2–8\nWeeks\n3–10\nMonths\nCuring\nThe curing phase is a period of controlled fermentation of the dry cannabis\nflower. The conditions under which fermentation occurs, as well as the\nduration of the fermentation process, further affect the cannabis flower’s\naroma, taste and cannabinoid composition.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 33\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nCultivation Facilities\nThere are three general types of cannabis cultivation facilities: outdoor facilities, where cannabis is\ngrown under natural sunlight and widely exposed to the elements; greenhouse facilities, where cannabis\nis grown under filtered sunlight and environmental conditions are partially controlled; and indoor\nfacilities, where cannabis is grown under electrical lighting and environmental conditions are tightly\ncontrolled. Some facilities combine features of these general types. For example, some greenhouses rely\nprimarily on filtered sunlight but also employ supplementary electrical lighting to influence the plant\nflowering cycle. Each type of facility is suitable for certain purposes.\nGrowing indoors under electrical lighting is the most expensive way to grow cannabis, but typically\nyields the highest quality cannabis by providing for maximum control over variables such as\nlight, air, nutrition, and exposure to contaminants and pests. Electrical lighting products for indoor\ncultivation include traditional and compact fluorescent lamps, high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps\nand light-emitting diode (LED) lamps. Adequate carbon dioxide levels can be maintained indoors with\neither bottled CO 2 or CO 2 generators. Common indoor growth mediums include soil, hydroponic\nsystems (wherein nutrients are added to sand, gravel or liquid growth medium) and aeroponic systems\n(wherein roots hang suspended in a nutritional aerosol solution). Indoor cultivation facilities are prevalent\nin Canada and certain parts of the United States where climatic conditions are not favorable to\noutdoor cannabis cultivation.\nIndoor Grow Rooms\nAeroponic Systems\n34 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nCompared to indoor cultivation facilities that use electrical lighting, greenhouse and outdoor facilities\nare generally less expensive to operate and more appropriate for large-scale projects, but provide less\ncontrol over growing conditions. The use of natural sunlight provides substantial savings on lighting\nequipment and energy costs, but may limit the number of grow cycles per year. Outdoor and greenhouse\nenvironments are more exposed to environmental risks that may negatively affect crops, such as\npests, contaminants and adverse weather. Outdoor and greenhouse cultivation facilities are prevalent in\nOregon, California and certain Latin American countries, which have climates conducive to outdoor\ngrowing.\nOutdoor Greenhouses\nThe Business of Cannabis Cultivation\nCultivation businesses must navigate a host of operational challenges, including state and local licensing\nrequirements, facility design and construction, research and acquisition of cannabis strains, intellectual\nproperty protection, cultivation process engineering, supply-chain management, yield optimization,\nfacility management and security. Many cultivation businesses retain outside consultants to advise\non one or more of these issues, although some businesses manage their entire cultivation operations\ninternally. A cultivator may wholesale cannabis flower and other plant material to cannabis concentrate\nmanufacturers or retail dispensaries, or it may be part of a vertically integrated production and retail\nbusiness that sells its flower and other internally manufactured products through its own dispensaries.\nCertain U.S. laws, foreign laws and international treaties currently restrict interstate and some\ninternational movement of cannabis products. A cultivation business that wishes to scale its operations\ninto a new jurisdiction often must invest significant capital in a new cultivation facility located within\nthe new jurisdiction. As laws change to allow more interstate and international transportation of cannabis\nproducts, cultivators who are operating redundant facilities or expensive indoor facilities will face\nincreased margin pressure. As the cannabis industry matures and becomes more commodi tized, we\nexpect the most successful cultivators will be those with strong consumer brands or scalable low-cost\noperations in regions where the climate is conducive to agricultural production.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 35\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nProduction Equipment and Supplies\nProduction equipment and supplies include the physical components used in cannabis production.\nMany industry participants in this subsegment provide products to a broad range of fully legal industries\nand do not “touch the plant”; therefore, these participants typically do not require special cannabisrelated\nlicenses and generally avoid legal risks related to violations of federal law.\nSome components of cannabis production are similar or identical to components used in other\nagricultural industries (such as irrigation systems), and some are specialized for application to the\ncannabis industry (such as extraction machines). Components supplied for many indoor and greenhouse\ncultivation facilities include electrical lighting equipment, air filtration and circulation systems,\nirrigation systems, nutrient management systems, drying and curing equipment, and computercontrolled\nautomation and monitoring systems. Specialty cannabis equipment companies now provide\n“all-in-one” automated indoor cultivation systems that can be used for in-home cultivation or scaled\nfor commercial purposes.\nExtraction System\nCultivation System\nProduction and Testing Services\nProduction services include cannabis extraction and product manufacturing services provided primarily\non a business-to-business basis to cultivators, consumer product companies and retail dispensaries.\nExtraction companies invest in specialized equipment that transforms cannabis flower into concentrates\nintended for wholesale. Product manufacturing services companies process cannabis flower or\nconcentrates, or provide packaging and wholesale services.\nTesting services include scientific testing of cannabis products and reporting of information about\nproduct quality, safety and composition. Cannabis products are tested at multiple stages of production\nfor genetic information and strain verification, cannabinoid and terpene composition and\n36 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\npotency, moisture content and the presence of contaminants, such as residual solvents, heavy metals,\nmycotoxins, microorganisms and pesticides. Testing, labeling and certification requirements vary\nwidely across jurisdictions, but increasingly are being required by state law and demanded by supplychain\nintermediaries and consumers. Uniform standards for testing and reporting are expected to\nemerge as scientific understanding of cannabis increases and as industry consensus about cannabisrelated\nhealth and safety concerns develops.\nProviders of extraction, manufacturing and testing services generally must obtain state and local\ncannabis licenses and are exposed to risks related to federal legal violations.\nComposition and Potency\nLaboratories ordinarily test cannabis for the specific amounts of 10 to 15 cannabinoids and more than\n30 terpenes. Cultivators and production intermediaries rely on these test results to identify and track\ncannabis varieties and to monitor the quality and consistency of production methods. Retailers and\nconsumers use test results information to assist in purchasing decisions. Almost all consumer products\nnow include labeling that, at a minimum, indicates the amounts of THC and CBD.\nPesticides\nControlling and disclosing the presence of pesticides in cannabis products is increasingly becoming\na focus of regulators and producers. Even cannabis grown under organic conditions can be exposed\nto pesticides inadvertently, so many states now require all cannabis products to be tested by a statelicensed\nlaboratory for pesticides. Pesticides can be especially problematic in cannabis concentrates;\nstudies have shown extraction processes may concentrate pesticides at a rate higher than cannabinoids\nand terpenes.\nMicrobiological Organisms\nCertain molds, other fungi and bacteria found in and on the cannabis plant can damage the plant\nor certain cannabis products and can be harmful if consumed by humans. Mold is a problem most\ncommonly found in indoor growing environments and during the cannabis drying and curing process.\nOrganisms found in cannabis and identified by testing includes aspergillus, salmonella, pseudomonas\nand E.coli.\nResidual Solvents\nMost extraction processes use solvents to extract the active compounds from cannabis plant material.\nCommonly used solvents include butane, carbon dioxide, ethanol or propane. Residual solvents are\nthose trace amounts of solvents that remain in a cannabis concentrate after the extraction process.\nSome residual solvents can be harmful if consumed by humans in sufficient amounts, and others\nshould not be consumed in any amount.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 37\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nSample Laboratory Test Results\n38 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nProduction Opportunities\nWe believe opportunities in this segment include:\nSpecialized Production Services. Production services companies that invest in the necessary equipment\nand facilities should see strong demand for high-margin specialized services from cultivators\nand other production intermediaries. We expect opportunities will expand for companies that provide\nextraction services (particularly those who professionally manage hazardous processes such as hydrocarbon\nextraction) or develop proprietary infused-product manufacturing processes.\nEnergy-efficient, Integrated Cultivation Components. We anticipate continued design and construction\nof sophisticated indoor cultivation facilities, which should present a significant opportunity\nfor suppliers of advanced cultivation components that improve yield and reduce energy costs. We\nbelieve companies that provide all-in-one integrated systems for automation, monitoring and control\nof the production process are more likely to succeed than companies that merely offer a single-point\nsolution.\nBranded Laboratory Test Certification. Given the importance of product testing, we believe that\nleading providers of high-quality testing services have an opportunity to establish an industry recognized\n“certification,” and that such a certification may become a key factor in influencing consumer\nconfidence and demand.\nEfficiencies in Cannabis Cultivation. We believe that certain segments of the market will become\nincreasingly commoditized and that cultivators with low production costs and high yields will have\nsignificant competitive advantage. Cultivators with operations in regions conducive to low-cost natural\nproduction should benefit as laws are changed to facilitate interstate and international cannabis\ncommerce.\nProduction Challenges\nChallenges in this segment include:\nScaling Cultivation Operations. Current laws typically force cultivators to build, and obtain licenses\nfor, potentially redundant, capital-intensive cultivation facilities in each jurisdiction they serve. The\ncapital requirements and uncertainty around licensing present serious challenges to cultivators seeking\nto scale their operations.\nDownward-pricing Pressure on Cannabis Flower. Cannabis wholesale prices are declining as largescale\ncultivators begin to commoditize cannabis flower. Small and inefficient cultivators (including\nhigh-cost indoor producers) may struggle to produce cannabis at effective margins as cannabis cultivation\nmigrates to global regions with conditions that support low-cost, sustainable production.\nLack of Standardized Testing. Currently, it may be difficult or impossible to reliably compare test\nresults between providers of testing services because the cannabis industry has not yet developed uniform\ntesting standards. Until the industry adopts uniform standards that address testing procedures\nand reporting for a broad variety of flower, concentrates and infused products, providers of testing\nservices may struggle to develop an industry-wide brand and reputation for quality.\nAccess to Capital. Participants in this segment generally engage in capital-intensive operations.\nIn particular, cultivation, contract manufacturing and testing facilities require significant capital\ninvestment. Emerging companies in this segment may struggle to raise sufficient capital to compete\neffectively.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 39\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nProduction Outlook\nDue to U.S. federal and international legal restrictions on cannabis commerce, producers currently\nmust invest significant capital in potentially redundant facilities located in separate jurisdictions, and\nmany large agricultural producers and equipment suppliers that could effectively compete in the cannabis\nindustry are reluctant to enter the market. In the near term, we expect that cultivators will continue\nto raise capital for facilities across multiple jurisdictions, and well-managed and well-financed\ncultivators will differentiate themselves by creating consistent, high-quality strains, developing strong\ndistribution relationships, vertically integrating other supply-chain functions and offering branded\nproducts and competitive pricing. We also expect production services companies will benefit from\nincreasing demand for specialized extraction and manufacturing services that cultivators and other\nproduction intermediaries cannot efficiently perform themselves, and providers of testing services will\nbenefit from increasingly robust testing and safety regulations. In the long run, we expect more permissive\ndomestic and foreign laws will result in increased competition from large enterprises that are\nable to realize economies of scale or have operations in regions best suited for efficient, sustainable\nproduction.\nn Distribution\nWe divide the distribution segment of the cannabis industry into three subsegments: dispensaries,\ne-commerce and distribution services. Dispensaries are retail outlets where consumers purchase cannabis\nproducts for medical or recreational purposes. E-commerce includes digital applications used to\nenhance the cannabis shopping experience. Distribution services include wholesale and related transportation\nand logistics services. Participants in the distribution segment generally “touch the plant”\nand therefore must comply with state and local regulations—which often require licenses or permits—\nand must accept legal risks related to federal cannabis restrictions.\nDispensaries\nCannabis dispensaries are “point of sale” retail establishments where consumers may purchase medical\nor recreational cannabis products. Cannabis dispensaries are the face of the cannabis industry in many\ncommunities and, consequently, they occupy one of the most heavily regulated and scrutinized positions\nin the cannabis supply chain.\nDispensaries in established state-legal markets provide consumers with a typical retail shopping\nexperience. Dispensaries typically range in size from 1,000 to 10,000 square feet of retail space. A dispensary\nmay offer between 10 to 50 strains of cannabis flower and a variety of concentrates, edibles,\ntopicals and accessories. Inventory is either acquired from cultivators and other wholesale product\nsuppliers, or cultivated and produced internally. Products may be illustrated in menus or displayed on\nshelves and may also be available for customers to touch, smell or otherwise examine. Trained customer\nservice staff, often known as “budtenders,” are typically available to educate customers about product\nofferings.\n40 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nDispensary Exterior Views\nDispensary Interior Views\nCustomer Interactions\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 41\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nBecause dispensaries “touch the plant,” they must usually obtain a state license. Obtaining a state\ndispensary license generally involves a multi-month application process that requires the applicant to\ndemonstrate compliance with complex license criteria and local regulations, such as producing their\nown products (or being prohibited from doing so), locating their dispensary outside a city’s ordinary\nretail or commercial zones, operating as a nonprofit cooperative or collective, tracking cannabis products\nfrom “seed to sale,” and collecting taxes on behalf of the state. Dispensaries must also comply\nwith applicable regulations related to product testing, packaging and labeling, security, and health and\nsanitary conditions.\nAn extensive network of dispensaries across jurisdictions will facilitate the growth of the cannabis\nindustry and its ability to attract new consumers. Currently, states with the most extensive networks\nof dispensaries are those that have both recreational and medical cannabis laws, such as Colorado,\nOregon and Washington, and those that have had medical cannabis laws for a long period of time, such\nas California. For example, according to the Rocky Mountain High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area,\nas of June 2017, in Colorado there were 491 cannabis dispensaries, compared to 392 Starbucks and\n208 McDonald’s.\nE-Commerce\nE-commerce refers to the use of digital applications to enhance the cannabis shopping experience. For\nexample, a mobile application may facilitate the comparison of cannabis products and pricing or the\ndelivery of orders from local dispensaries. These applications are being developed by a host of market\nparticipants, ranging from software development companies to retail dispensaries. Due to federal\nrestrictions, cannabis e-commerce transactions are currently conducted only intrastate. If and when\nfederal restrictions change to allow interstate cannabis commerce, we expect that home-delivery and\ne-commerce services will increase significantly. E-commerce solutions with high consumer engagement\n(such as those providing reviews and price comparisons for a broad selection of products) will help\nretailers acquire and retain customers.\nSample E-Commerce Menus\n42 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nDistribution Services\nDistribution services is emerging as a prominent subsegment of the cannabis industry; services in this\nsubsegment include wholesale distribution of cannabis products to retailers and production intermediaries,\nas well as related transportation and logistics services. Historically, a high percentage of\nproduct manufacturers have sold directly to retail dispensaries, and some of those manufacturers with\nestablished “in-house” distribution channels are now leveraging their experience to offer distribution\nservices to third-party manufacturers.\nCurrently, distribution activities must be conducted only intrastate, and providers of distribution\nservices must comply with regulations related to “touching the plant,” including testing and taxcollection\nrequirements. As laws are changed to allow more interstate and international transportation,\npurchasers will be able to compare products and prices on a national or international basis, and distributors\nwho provide superior product selections and transportation logistics should have significant\ncompetitive advantage.\nDistribution Opportunities\nWe believe opportunities in this segment include:\nE-Commerce Distribution. The ability to accept electronic orders and deliver cannabis products\non demand represents an attractive distribution channel and growth opportunity. Companies that\nprovide digital retail platforms for cannabis products will benefit as consumers migrate to e-commerce\ntransactions.\nBranded and Vertically Integrated Dispensaries. We believe that consumers will ultimately concentrate\ntheir purchases with a small group of branded dispensaries that provide a distinct, consistent\nand trusted retail experience and offer supporting e-commerce solutions. Dispensaries that integrate\nvertically to offer their own branded products should achieve superior margins on those products.\nHigh-profile Retail Locations. We see an opportunity for cannabis dispensaries to attract significantly\nmore customers by establishing storefronts in malls and other high-profile retail locations.\n“Land Grab” of Desirable Locations. Companies able to navigate the licensing and real estate challenges\nrequired to secure and operate multiple dispensaries in desirable locations should benefit from\nexisting high barriers to entry and capture significant market share.\nDistribution Challenges\nChallenges in this segment include:\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention. Like e-commerce businesses in other industries, providers of\ne-commerce solutions in the cannabis industry face intense competition for customers who can easily\nchange vendor loyalties. Companies will be challenged to minimize customer acquisition costs and\nretain customers.\nRestrictive and Changing Regulations. Obtaining a state dispensary license or other type of distribution\npermit typically involves a multi-month application process that requires the applicant to\ndemonstrate compliance with complex criteria. In addition to state laws and regulations, dispensaries\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 43\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nand other distribution intermediaries are subject to county, municipal and other local regulations that\nmay restrict or even prohibit distribution activities. The success of any dispensary operator or distributor\ndepends on anticipating and complying with these regulations.\nTax Issues Related to Distribution. States and localities that legalize cannabis are focused on the\npotential to generate tax revenue from the industry. Ambiguous, constantly changing and potentially\nburdensome taxation rules may make it difficult for dispensary operators or distributors to remain in\ngood standing with licensing, regulatory and tax collection agencies and may negatively impact their\nfinancial results.\nDistribution Outlook\nWe expect dispensaries across the United States to increasingly seek to provide modern retail experiences\nthat are supported by e-commerce applications. We also expect that the most well-run dispensaries\nwill continue to generate significant cash flow at compelling margins. Dispensaries should be able\nto gain advantage by producing their own products, by developing strategic or exclusive relationships\nwith specialty producers or by finding ways to generate customer loyalty. However, oversaturation\nin the number of dispensaries in certain jurisdictions, such as Colorado, has led to a very competitive\nenvironment, consolidation and moratoriums on issuing new local dispensary licenses by various\nmunicipalities.\nThe distribution segment is subject to some of the strictest and most frequently changing regulations\napplicable to the cannabis industry. While distribution opportunities may arise with changes\nin law, some legislation may cause significant disruption. For example, the number of dispensaries\noperating in the greater Los Angeles region is expected to decrease significantly in the short term as\nCalifornia’s new cannabis regulatory agency begins its oversight and enforcement efforts in 2018.\nThe distribution services subsegment in the United States is still in its infancy and has experienced\na number of growing pains related to a lack of well-established distribution channels. For example, a\nNevada law generally requiring dispensaries to use third-party distributors proved troublesome when\ndispensaries sold out of product within 48 hours after legal recreational cannabis sales commenced in\nthe state. As more distribution channels and points of contact are established, we believe that opportunities\nfor third-party distribution services companies will increase.\nIn certain legalized international markets, such as Germany and Uruguay, cannabis products\nare sold primarily through existing pharmacy networks (Argentina plans to do the same). While\ncannabis-derived pharmaceuticals may ultimately be distributed the same way in the United States,\nwe believe the future domestic distribution channels of other types of cannabis products will closely\nresemble those of alcohol and tobacco products.\n44 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nn Consumer Products\nCannabis may be consumed in many different forms, which fall into three broad categories: flower,\nconcentrates and infused products. The most popular way to consume cannabis historically has been\nto smoke the flower or “bud” from the cannabis plant, which can be done using a pipe, a hand-rolled\ncigarette (often referred to as a “joint”) or a water pipe (often referred to as a “bong”). Cannabis flower\ncan also be vaporized and inhaled (using a product known as a “vaporizer”). The active compounds\nin cannabis can be extracted and concentrated into oil or waxlike substances known as concentrates.\nConcentrates, in turn, can either be vaporized and inhaled or infused into products known as “infused\nproducts.” Infused products may be applied topically, such as lotions and creams, or consumed orally,\nsuch as food and drinks (known as “edibles”), capsules, pills and tinctures.\nWhen smoke or vapor from heated flower or a concentrate is inhaled, the active compounds travel\ndirectly to the central nervous system and the physiological effects typically begin within one to five\nminutes. When infused products are consumed orally, the active compounds are digested in the stomach\nand metabolized by the liver before taking effect, typically in one to two hours. Compared to\ninhaled products, infused products deliver a smaller relative amount of cannabinoids to the bloodstream,\nbut they produce longer-lasting effects.\nInnovative companies continue to expand the universe of cannabis products, developing brands\nwith packaging that increasingly emphasizes education about the product’s effects and appeals to mainstream\nconsumers. Cannabis flower is currently the most widely sold form of cannabis, but concentrates\nand infused products are gaining in popularity.\nThe following chart shows the combined relative sales by product category for Colorado, Oregon\nand Washington (three states with relatively mature recreational and medical cannabis markets) for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2017.\nProduct Sales by Category: Q3 2017\n14%\n12%\n51%\n23%\nFlower Concentrates Edibles Other\nSource: BDS Analytics\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 45\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nCannabis Flower\nCannabis flower, or “bud,” is the most popular product among cannabis consumers. Cannabis flower\nis usually green (although some varieties have a purple or orange hue), slightly sticky to the touch and\nspongy in density. The flower has a strong, pungent aroma owing primarily to the trichomes on the\nflowers, which contain the highest concentrations of cannabinoids and terpenes of any part of the\nplant.\nBranded Cannabis Flower\nThere are thousands of different cannabis varieties, each with its own cannabinoid and terpene\nprofile and corresponding aroma, flavor and potency. Leading cultivators are recognized each year in\ncontests and ceremonies for their indica, sativa and hybrid varieties. Award-winning varieties—which\nare often given unique identifying names—frequently become the most in demand by consumers.\nPopular varieties today include “Blue Dream,” “Gelato,” “OG Kush,” “Pineapple Express” and “Sour\nDiesel.”\nThe flower of a typical cannabis variety produced for human consumption contains approximately\n15% to 30% THC, approximately 0.1% to 1% CBD and nominal levels of other cannabinoids. Due\nto advancements in cultivation techniques, THC levels in cannabis flower available today are generally\nmuch higher than in the past.\nConcentrates\nCannabis can be processed into a variety of concentrates, many of which are sold as finished products\nfor smoking or vaporizing and some of which can be infused into other products, such as edibles and\ntopicals. Concentrates include CO 2 oil, butane hash oil or “BHO,” shatter, wax, live resin, budder,\nkief, ice water hash and rosin.\nConcentrates are quickly becoming popular for a host of reasons. Some believe vaporizing or ingesting\nconcentrates are healthier methods of cannabis consumption than smoking plant material. Extracting\ncannabinoids from the cannabis plant produces higher-potency dosing (THC content can exceed\n80% in concentrates), enables custom formulations and flavor profiles, and facilitates consumption\nthat is more convenient and discreet than smoking. The concentration of specific cannabinoids varies\n46 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nacross cannabis varieties and even across flowers from the same plant, which limits the accuracy of laboratory\ntests conducted on a sample of plant material. Cannabis concentrates, however, are generally\nhomogeneous and their active elements can be more precisely measured and reported so as to facilitate\nstandardization of products and accurate dosing by consumers.\nThe following chart shows the combined relative sales by category of concentrates for Colorado,\nOregon and Washington for the three months ended September 30, 2017.\nConcentrates Sales by Category: Q3 2017\n18%\n6%\n8%\n16%\n35%\n17%\nLive resin Oils Other concentrates Shatter Vape oil Wax\nSource: BDS Analytics\nConcentrates are prepared with extraction techniques that fall into two general categories, solventbased\nextraction and solvent-free extraction. Solvent-based extraction techniques include the use of\nhydrocarbon, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) or ethanol solutions to chemically isolate cannabinoids and other\nactive compounds. Solvent-based extraction can be performed relatively quickly and can produce high\nyields and customized formulations, but requires the use of expensive equipment and skilled labor and\nalso may leave residual solvents in the resulting concentrate. Solvent-free techniques include the use of\nfilters, ice water or heat to physically separate parts of the cannabis plant with high cannabinoid concentrations.\nGenerally, solvent-free extraction is inexpensive and can be performed without specialized\nequipment, but it is also slow and labor-intensive and it typically results in low yields.\nHydrocarbon Extraction\nHydrocarbon extraction is a process whereby a hydrocarbon solvent (typically butane or propane)\nchemically extracts cannabinoids, terpenes and other compounds from cannabis plant matter. The\nsolvent is then purged using heat and pressure, leaving a concentrated form of the extracted compounds.\nBecause hydrocarbon extraction involves a risk of explosion and usually leaves behind residual\nsolvents, regulations are becoming more restrictive in specifying where and how the process can occur\nand prescribing acceptable levels of residual solvents in the resulting products. Concentrates prepared\nthrough hydrocarbon extraction—including BHO, shatter and wax—are popular with some consumers\nbecause hydrocarbon extraction generally preserves terpenes and the source plant’s aroma and\nflavor.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 47\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nCO 2 Extraction\nCO 2 extraction is a process whereby cannabis is introduced into a system of supercritical CO 2 (CO 2\nat a pressure and temperature at which it exhibits properties of both a gas and a liquid). Cannabinoids\nand other compounds dissolve in the supercritical CO 2 ; pressure is released, and the CO 2 then\nevaporates, leaving a concentrated form of the dissolved compounds. CO 2 extraction is considered a\nrelatively safe and clean extraction process because CO 2 is nonvolatile, CO 2 concentrates are generally\nfree of residual solvents and CO 2 extraction kills mold and bacteria. CO 2 extraction is commonly used\nto produce viscous CO 2 oil for vaporizer cartridges and low-terpene concentrates for infused products.\nEthanol Extraction\nEthanol extraction is a method used in a number of industries to extract essential oils and food flavorings\nfrom plants. When used to produce cannabis concentrates, the process involves soaking cannabis\nplant material in ethanol, which separates cannabinoids, terpenes and other compounds from the\nplant matter. The solution is then heated until the ethanol is purged to acceptable levels. Ethanol is\ngenerally much safer to use for extraction than hydrocarbons and is particularly useful for creating concentrates\nwith “whole-plant” compound profiles that mirror the source plant. Unfortunately, ethanol\nalso extracts certain plant compounds —particularly chlorophyll—that have undesirable aromas and\nflavors.\nSolvent-Free Extraction\nMost solvent-free extraction techniques are inexpensive and do not require special training or equipment,\nbut they also tend to produce low yields. Kief, ice water hash and rosin are examples of concentrates\nproduced with solvent-free methods. Kief is a collection of trichomes that are separated from\ncannabis flower by sifting the flower with specialized filtering screens. Ice water hash is a collection\nof trichomes produced by stirring cannabis in ice water, filtering the mixture through a sequence of\nincreasingly fine screens, removing the trichome collection from the finest screens and allowing it to\ndry. Rosin is created by heating and pressing cannabis plant material between parchment paper and\ncollecting the concentrate that oozes onto the paper.\nOil Concentrate (Cartridge) BHO Wax Rosin\nCannabis Concentrate Products\n48 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nInfused Products\nInfused products are ingestible products that have been infused with cannabinoids and other active\ncompounds from the cannabis plant. There are two general categories of infused products: those consumed\norally, such as foods and beverages (known as “edibles”), capsules, pills and tinctures; and those\napplied topically, such as lotions, balms and creams. Infused products may either be infused with\nconcentrates (that are prepared through one of the extraction techniques discussed previously) or prepared\nwith other infused products, such as cannabis-infused butter (a concentrate prepared by heating\ncannabis in butter to release the active compounds, and then filtering out the plant material).\nThe following chart shows the combined relative sales by category of infused products for Colorado,\nOregon and Washington for the three months ended September 30, 2017.\nInfused Products Sales by Category: Q3 2017\n8%\n2%\n10%\n44%\n11%\n25%\nCandy Chocolates Tinctures Infused foods Pills Other\nSource: BDS Analytics\nEdibles\nPopular edibles include infused candies, chocolates and beverages. The active compounds in edibles\nare digested and metabolized by the liver before taking effect; typically, the time from ingesting to\nonset of an effect is one to two hours, but the effect lasts longer than that resulting from inhaling\nsmoke or vapor. Edibles generally deliver body-focused effects, which may be preferred by consumers\nseeking pain relief.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 49\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nEdibles: Chocolate, sparkling water, mints, candies, brownies, gummies\n50 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nCapsules and Tinctures\nCapsules are cannabis concentrates with various cannabinoid profiles encapsulated in a gelatin coating\nfor easy swallowing. Capsules are digested and metabolized like edibles; typically, the time from swallowing\nto onset of an effect is one to two hours. Tinctures are concentrates suspended in an alcohol\nsolution and are usually placed under the tongue using a dropper; effects generally begin within 10\nto 15 minutes. Capsules and tinctures are preferred over edibles by some consumers who believe they\ndeliver more consistent dosing than edibles.\nCapsules\nTincture\nTopicals\nTopicals are any form of product infused with cannabinoids and applied topically, such as lotions,\nbalms, creams, lubricants and transdermal patches. Topicals often include noncannabis ingredients,\nsuch as essential oils or herbal extracts. They are commonly used for localized relief of muscle soreness\nand inflammation and for relief of headaches and cramping.\nTopicals\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 51\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nVaporizers and Accessories\nSmoking or vaporizing cannabis flower or concentrates is the most popular method of cannabis consumption,\nin part because the effects of inhaled cannabis smoke or vapor begin almost immediately.\nAccessories used to smoke cannabis include glass, wood or metal pipes; glass or plastic water pipes\nknown as “bongs”; and cigarette papers used to roll “joints.” A vaporizer is a device that heats cannabis\nflower or concentrate to a temperature at which its active compounds boil and can be inhaled as vapor.\nVaporizers are increasing in popularity faster than any other cannabis-consumption device, in some\nmeasure because vaporizing is perceived by many as a healthier method of cannabis consumption than\nsmoking. Distinguishing features of a vaporizer include whether it vaporizes flower or concentrate, the\nform of the heating mechanism, or “atomizer,” power output, battery efficiency, durability, reusability\n(there are both refillable and disposable vaporizers) and design aesthetics. Hundreds of vaporizers are\nmarketed, ranging from simple to complex, including handheld vaporizers that retail for $10 to $500\nand tabletop vaporizers that retail for $100 to more than $1,000.\nVaporizers\n52 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nCannabis Consumers Using Vaporizers\nIn addition to smoking and vaporizing devices, an increasing variety of other cannabis-related\naccessories are available, including personal storage and transportation products. Some of these products\nfocus on safety or discretion, such as childproof containers and smell-proof bags. Other products\nare designed more for style, such as vaporizer pouches and tabletop storage containers intended as\ndecor. The market for both safety-focused accessories and style pieces is expected to grow as laws\nand regulations increasingly impose requirements related to storage and transportation and as taboos\nregarding cannabis use wane.\nAccessories\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 53\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nPharmaceuticals\nCannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals are drugs containing cannabinoids or cannabinoid-like compounds\nthat are either derived from natural cannabis or chemically synthesized. A handful of such\ndrugs have been approved for use to treat certain medical conditions both in the United States and\nelsewhere. Examples of cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals that have been approved for use in various\ncountries include Marinol, Syndros, Cesamet and Sativex. Another cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical,\nEpidiolex, has not yet been approved but could become the first medicine derived from the cannabis\nplant to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nThe drug Marinol is comprised of dronabinol (a synthetic THC) encapsulated with sesame oil in a\nsoft gelatin capsule. Marinol has been approved by the FDA for use in treating (i) anorexia associated\nwith weight loss in patients with AIDS and (ii) nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy.\nMarinol is a Schedule III controlled substance under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act\n(CSA). Syndros is a drug that contains dronabinol in a liquid solution; it has been approved by the\nFDA for use by adults in treating the same symptoms for which Marinol has been approved. Syndros\nis a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA. Forms of dronabinol have been approved for use\nin jurisdictions outside the United States, including Canada and Denmark.\nCesamet is a drug made up of encapsulated nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid similar to THC.\nCesamet has been approved by the FDA for use in treating nausea and vomiting associated with cancer\nchemotherapy. Cesamet is a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA. Forms of nabilone have\nbeen approved for use in jurisdictions outside the United States, including Australia, Canada, Mexico\nand the United Kingdom.\nSativex is a mouth spray used for treatment of spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis; it includes\nTHC and CBD derived from cannabis. Sativex was first approved for use in the United Kingdom in\n2010, and has been approved for use in at least 30 countries (but not in the United States). Sativex is\nmanufactured by U.K.-based GW Pharmaceuticals and is generally recognized as the first prescription\ndrug in the world to include plant-based cannabinoids. The cannabis extract used in Sativex is a Schedule\nI controlled substance under the CSA.\nPharmaceuticals\n54 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nEpidiolex is an oral formulation of cannabis-derived cannabidiol, or CBD, intended to treat severe\nforms of childhood epilepsy. Epidiolex has not been approved for use in any country, but the drug’s\nmanufacturer, GW Pharmaceuticals, recently submitted a New Drug Application for Epidiolex to the\nFDA, which is an important step toward FDA approval in the United States. If approved by the FDA,\nEpidiolex would be the first FDA-approved prescription drug derived from cannabis. The cannabis\nextract used in Epidiolex is considered to be “marijuana,” a Schedule I controlled substance under the\nCSA. Therefore, even if Epidiolex were approved by the FDA, Epidiolex would need to be rescheduled\nand excepted from the “marijuana” definition before it could be lawfully prescribed in the United\nStates.\nConsumer Products Opportunities\nWe believe opportunities in this segment include:\nConsumer Product Brands Focused on Health and Wellness. We believe there is a substantial opportunity\nfor companies to develop leading brands of cannabis-based health and wellness products. Marketing\na broad line of such products under a common brand should provide a competitive advantage.\nDirect E-Commerce Distribution. The e-commerce market for cannabis products is expected to\nexpand and consumer awareness of product options is expected to increase, enabling more consumer\nproduct companies to sell their products directly to consumers through online purchasing platforms\nrather than selling only through wholesale.\nAdvanced Vaporizer Functionality. Vaporizer technology has advanced rapidly in recent years, a\ntrend we expect to continue. In the future, vaporizers may be able to identify the composition and\npotency of the product being consumed, monitor consumption and dosing of the product, or reorder\nthe product at the push of a button.\nSpecialty Formulations. We believe that scientific knowledge about the relationships between specific\ncannabinoid formulations and targeted health conditions will continue to improve, and markets\nwill be created for highly specialized products developed to relieve particular symptoms.\nFDA Approval and CSA Rescheduling. If Epidiolex is approved by the FDA and rescheduled under\nthe CSA to permit lawful prescriptions to be written within the United States, it would be the first federally\nlegal cannabis-derived drug in the country. Such a precedent could result in a significant increase\nin the use of cannabis by consumers as medicine, and it could also be followed by similar approvals in\nthe United States for other cannabis-derived drugs.\nConsumer Products Challenges\nChallenges in this segment include:\nMarketing and Customer Loyalty. As more products become available to consumers through dispensaries\nand e-commerce solutions, consumer product providers may need large marketing budgets\nto drive product awareness and customer loyalty.\nWholesale and Retail Distribution. Providers of cannabis products may struggle to develop wholesale\nand retail distribution relationships because of the breadth of products being marketed. Providers\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 55\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nshould seek to develop strong relationships with a large number of dispensary operators, directly or\nthrough a distributor, in order to obtain preferred shelf placement.\nFDA Approval: Risk, Time and Expense. Assuming that cannabis-derived drugs will eventually be\npermitted to be sold in the United States, considerable time and expense will be spent by manufacturers\nto obtain FDA approval and bring approved products to market. There is no guarantee that\ninvestments of significant time and money into research, development and clinical trials will result in\nFDA approval of cannabis products.\nProduct Liability Claims. Companies may be exposed to various product liability claims associated\nwith human consumption of cannabis products. Consumer claims that products cause injury or illness,\ninclude inadequate instructions for use or warnings concerning health risks, or cause possible side\neffects or interactions with other substances may be expensive to defend or settle.\nConsumer Products Outlook\nWe believe that there are significant market opportunities for well-recognized brands to develop in\nvarious categories of consumer products, particularly in flower, concentrates, edibles and vaporizers.\nIn addition, we believe that there are opportunities for companies targeting niche applications for the\npet industry. Many companies will struggle to create strong brands because the consumer products\nsegment generally has low barriers to entry and is currently oversaturated. As the cannabis industry and\nlegal environment develop, we expect that national brands will emerge from companies with large marketing\nbudgets, operational scale and reputations for quality, and that large alcohol, tobacco, consumer\nproducts and pharmaceutical companies will play a larger role in this segment.\nn Business Solutions\nThe business solutions segment of the cannabis industry comprises business software, such as seedto-sale\ntracking solutions, and business services, such as legal, compliance, operational consulting and\nfinancial services. Software and services providers in this segment generally do not “touch the plant”\nand do not require cannabis-related permits or licenses.\nBusiness Software\nSoftware solutions tailored to the cannabis industry are present throughout the cannabis supply chain.\nAlthough solutions from other manufacturing and retail industries are used in the cannabis industry,\nindustry-specific solutions are emerging as some of the most popular. Some companies provide point\nsolutions that target bottlenecks in the supply chain, while others offer broad platforms that consolidate\nmultiple capabilities. Industry-specific software applications exist and are being developed in the\nfollowing areas: cultivation cycle management; concentrate production management; infused product\nmanufacturing management; product testing and compliance; retail operations (including point-ofsale,\ninventory, tax reporting and compliance solutions); mobile, e-commerce and delivery applications;\nsupply-chain management; customer relationship management; and management reporting and\nbusiness intelligence.\n56 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER III\nCannabis Industry Segmentation\nCannabis Software Platforms\nBusiness Services\nThe business services market includes (i) operational consulting, including facility planning, construction\nand security; (ii) financial services, including accounting and payment-processing services;\n(iii) legal, compliance and other professional advisory services; (iv) temporary and full-time staffing\nservices; (v) real estate services; and (vi) industry events and conferences. These services are typically\nprovided by professional services firms; some of these firms focus solely on the cannabis industry while\nothers serve a broad range of industries.\nBusiness Solutions Opportunities\nWe believe opportunities in this segment include:\nIndustry-specific Solutions. As the cannabis industry emerges, there will be a significant market\nopportunity for providers of solutions tailored for the industry. Point-solution providers may be acquisition\ntargets if larger companies enter the market in the future.\nIntegrated Platforms. We believe that integrated “seed-to-sale” solutions will be ideally positioned.\n“Big Data” Analytics. We believe that there is an attractive opportunity to develop and license\nindustry datasets. Such datasets should provide strategic advantages to organizations that establish\nsubstantial reach early and may also be licensed more broadly to enhance targeting, services, cross-sales\nand product development.\nBusiness Solutions Challenges\nChallenges in this segment include:\nDevelopment and Deployment Risk. Due to the time and investment required to develop software\nproducts and the emerging nature of the cannabis industry, there is a risk that developed applications\nmay not be effective or widely adopted. In addition, certain segments of the cannabis industry are more\nmature than others; this disparity may present challenges in developing solutions that support cohesive\nand scalable business models.\nLow Barriers to Entry. Numerous sectors of the business services market are becoming increasingly\ncrowded.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 57\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nBusiness Solutions Outlook\nThe cannabis industry presents a significant market opportunity for software and services providers\nbecause of the large number of potential new clients and the need for industry-specific solutions. In\nparticular, we believe that substantial opportunities exist for providers of industry-specific, platform\nand “big data” solutions. We also believe that financial, legal and compliance service providers that have\ndeveloped knowledge of the cannabis industry are well positioned for growth. Similar to the production\nsegment, large software and services companies serving traditional industries have been reluctant\nto enter the cannabis market due to concerns over the regulatory landscape. While this dynamic has\ncreated a short-term opportunity for some smaller companies, as the regulatory environment becomes\nclearer we expect competition in this segment to increase significantly as large companies enter the\nmarket.\nn Digital Media\nThe digital media segment of the cannabis industry includes digital content, networking and directory\nplatforms. Digital media providers do not “touch the plant” and generally do not need a cannabisrelated\nlicense or permit. Digital media focused on cannabis is a niche sector within the broader digital\nmedia market. Companies in this segment compete for viewers and subscribers and generally draw\nrevenue from content licensing fees, service fees, advertisement fees and subscription fees. They provide\na broad range of content and networking tools, including news related to the cannabis industry and\nlegalization efforts, humor and entertainment focused on the cannabis-user demographic, traditional\nmedia and branding services, social networking tools that allow users to share pictures and information\nrelated to their cannabis activities, and business directory tools that connect industry participants.\nCannabis Digital Media\n58 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nDigital Media Opportunities\nWe believe opportunities in this segment include:\nPremium Content. We believe that opportunities exist to establish industry-specific publications\nand media platforms for both the business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets that are\nviewed as the legitimate voices of the industry.\nMobile Applications. E-commerce and digital media applications are well positioned for mobile\ndeployment within the cannabis industry. We expect a proliferation of mobile applications, even in the\nearly stages of the industry.\nEnabling Technology. Continued development of core and shared technology platforms remains\nan opportunity for digital media companies seeking to provide a better user experience. Technologies\nthat provide targeted experiences should enable digital media companies to realize greater returns on\ninvestments.\nDigital Media Challenges\nChallenges in this segment include:\nLimited Number of Advertisers. Broad, general-market advertisers are not commonly participating\nin the cannabis industry due to concerns about legal compliance and mass-market perception. As a\nresult, companies are currently competing for limited advertising revenue targeted at the cannabis-user\ndemographic.\nVenues. Established digital media companies—such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and Yelp—limit\nthe activities of cannabis-focused media companies on their sites in accordance with company policies.\nThis creates opportunities for niche publishers in the near term, but we believe that, ultimately, large\nmedia companies will view cannabis as a mainstream industry.\nDigital Media Outlook\nThe opportunity for cannabis-oriented digital media is substantial. We believe that companies with\nwell-executed strategies will emerge as the recognized voices of the industry and will be relied on by\nconsumers for a wealth of information from product recommendations to industry news. As regulatory\nconstraints relax, we expect the currently disparate and fragmented digital media services segment to\nconsolidate into integrated publishing, mobile and e-commerce offerings. However, as stated previously,\nwe believe that digital media companies focused solely on the cannabis industry will eventually\nface considerable competition from —but may be logical acquisition targets for—traditional media\ncompanies.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 59\n\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nThe legal landscape for the cannabis industry in the United States continues to be characterized by\nconflict between federal prohibition and the steady advance of state legalization. According to federal\npolicy, Americans can access tobacco, alcohol and prescription drug products that kill thousands each\nyear, but they cannot access cannabis because it is a dangerous drug with no currently accepted medical\napplication in the United States (notwithstanding the federal government holds a U.S. patent for\nmethods of treating diseases with cannabinoids). Meanwhile, 46 U.S. states permit some use of cannabis\nproducts as medicine by adults or children, and 8 of those states have laws that regulate cannabis\nlike alcohol.\nThe U.S cannabis industry has proven adept at navigating this federal-state conflict and is experiencing\nrapid growth despite it. Moreover, we believe that federal policy will move (and may already be\nmoving) in a new direction—one that would facilitate federal approval of cannabis-derived drugs and\nultimately, we believe, give rise to a regulatory and political environment in which the U.S. Congress\ncould fully legalize both medical and recreational cannabis.\nIn this chapter, we summarize three categories of state cannabis laws and examine certain federal\nlaws and policies that impact the cannabis industry, including federal laws related to drug and food regulation,\nbanking and finance, and intellectual property. Finally, we offer our views about how the cannabis\nlegalization trend and related developments likely lead to a federally legal U.S. cannabis industry.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 61\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nn U.S. State Law\nOf the 51 jurisdictions comprising the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, 47 have enacted\nat least one law that permits the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing or possession of cannabis or\nconcentrates. These laws fall into three general categories:\n• 29 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have enacted medical cannabis laws that permit\nthe production and possession of cannabis or concentrates for use in treating a broad range of\nqualifying medical conditions.\n• 19 U.S. states have enacted narrow CBD/limited laws that permit possession of small amounts\nof low-THC/high-CBD cannabis concentrates for use in treating a few serious medical conditions—in\nparticular, severe forms of childhood epilepsy.\n• 8 U.S. states have enacted recreational laws that permit the commercial production and sale of\ncannabis to adults for recreational and other uses.\nSome states have passed more than one of these laws, and some state laws do not fall clearly into\nany one of these categories. Florida and Delaware have both medical cannabis and CBD/limited laws.\nEvery state that has enacted a recreational law has also passed a medical cannabis law. A District of\nColumbia law that permits adults to grow and consume cannabis is often cited as a recreational law;\nhowever, we do not characterize it as such because it does not permit the commercial production and\nsale of cannabis.

Since the beginning of 2000, 24 more states and the\nDistrict of Columbia have passed medical cannabis laws that permit the production and possession of\ncannabis or concentrates for use in treating a broad range of qualifying medical conditions.\nA state medical cannabis law permits a patient, with a doctor’s recommendation, to use cannabis to\ntreat any qualifying medical condition designated by the law. It is illegal for a doctor to “prescribe” a\nSchedule I controlled substance under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (CSA), so medical cannabis\nlaws typically require a doctor’s “recommendation” rather than a prescription. Some medical cannabis\nlaws require a written recommendation, while others allow an oral recommendation. States may impose\na variety of other requirements or restrictions on a doctor or patient relating to medical cannabis access,\nsuch as patient registration with a state medical cannabis registry, submission of a patient’s fingerprints\nor prohibition of use by convicted felons or certain government employees (for example, firefighters).\nThe number and nature of qualifying conditions included in medical cannabis laws vary widely.\nSome laws designate relatively few or highly specific medical conditions, while other laws include many\nconditions or highly subjective conditions, such as chronic pain. Some medical cannabis laws also\ngive doctors discretion to recommend cannabis for conditions not specifically designated. In aggregate,\nacross all medical cannabis laws in the United States, cannabis is legally recognized as a form of\ntherapy or medicine for more than 50 qualifying conditions. Common qualifying conditions include\nAlzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), anorexia, arthritis, cachexia, cancer, chronic\npain, Crohn’s disease, epilepsy, glaucoma, hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS, inflammation, migraine, multiple\nsclerosis (MS), nausea, nervous system degeneration, Parkinson’s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD) and spasms.\nSome medical cannabis laws restrict the form of cannabis or the means of consumption. For example,\nPennsylvania’s medical cannabis law, enacted in 2016, prohibits smoking or vaporizing cannabis\nflower, prohibits the incorporation of cannabis into foods by anyone other than the patient or the\npatient’s caregiver, and authorizes cannabis to be dispensed only in certain concentrated forms.\nMedical cannabis laws generally permit cannabis cultivation and distribution by a state-licensed\ncultivator or dispensary, by a qualified patient or by a designated caregiver of the patient. A qualified\npatient or the patient’s designated caregiver generally may grow only an amount of cannabis deemed\nsufficient for the patient’s personal use. Some medical cannabis laws permit patients or caregivers to\ngrow cannabis only if they cannot practically obtain it by other means. For example, certain states\npermit patients to grow cannabis only if they reside more than a specified distance from the nearest\nlicensed dispensary. Some states allow qualified patients and designated caregivers to collectively or\ncooperatively aggregate their cultivation activities.\nState-licensed cultivators and dispensaries must satisfy various licensing requirements related to\nhealth, safety and security. In states that permit or require vertical integration, a licensee may be part\n64 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nof a single cultivation and dispensing enterprise. In other states, a licensed cultivator may be permitted\nto sell to unaffiliated licensed dispensaries or delivery services, which then retail medical cannabis to\npatients.\nEach state has its own rules about whether medical cannabis activities may be engaged in for profit.\nIn states where caregivers and qualified patients collectively or cooperatively aggregate their cultivation\nand distribution efforts, participants generally are allowed to charge amounts necessary to recover the\nreasonable costs associated with those activities but may not operate for profit. In states that allow\nlicensed cannabis activities, such as cultivation and dispensing, the organizations engaged in those\nactivities generally may seek to earn a profit.\nCBD/Limited Laws\nFrom 2014 through 2017, a total of 19 U.S. states enacted CBD/limited laws that generally permit\npossession of small amounts of low-THC/high-CBD cannabis concentrates for use in treating a few\nserious medical conditions. Most of these laws limit qualifying medical conditions to severe forms of\nepilepsy or seizure disorders, but some laws designate a moderately broader set of conditions.\nMost CBD/limited laws allow CBD use by children. Many of these laws were enacted in the context\nof high-profile stories about CBD treatments for children with severe seizure disorders, and the\nlaws have been given names like Carly’s Law (Alabama), Haleigh’s Hope Act (Georgia) and Julian’s Law\n(South Carolina). Charlotte’s Web is a low-THC/high-CBD cannabis strain named for Charlotte Figi,\na young Colorado girl whose parents treat her seizure condition with CBD oil. Her case was featured\nin Dr. Sanjay Gupta’s popular CNN special, Weed.\nIn general, each CBD/limited law establishes a narrow legal framework for use of low-THC/\nhigh-CBD cannabis concentrates. Certain CBD/limited laws designate only one or several producers\nof permitted cannabis concentrates; in some cases, these producers include a state university or research\ninstitution. Other CBD/limited laws establish no legal framework for the production or distribution of\npermitted products and merely provide a narrow affirmative defense for state-law cannabis possession\nand use charges.\nRecreational Laws\nIn 2012, Colorado and Washington voters passed the first laws in the United States (and the world) to\npermit the commercial production and sale of cannabis to adults for recreational and other uses. Alaska\nand Oregon passed similar recreational laws in 2014. And in the November 2016 elections, four more\nstates—California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada—passed recreational laws. (Of the five recreational\nlaws included on November 2016 ballots, only Arizona’s law did not receive voter approval.)\nState recreational laws permit adults aged 21 years or older to legally purchase and use cannabis\nsold by state-licensed commercial businesses. There are no state residency requirements for adult consumers,\nand out-of-state visitors with valid proof of age may legally purchase cannabis, giving rise to\n“cannabis tourism” in states with extensive dispensary networks like Colorado, Oregon and Washington.\nCannabis typically may not be consumed in public spaces or private establishments open to\nthe public, such as parks and restaurants. Recreational laws also generally permit adults to cultivate a\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 65\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nlimited number of cannabis plants (typically, 4 to 6) for personal use. (Washington is an exception,\nhowever, and makes personal cultivation a felony unless it is done by a person registered in the state’s\nmedical marijuana database.) Unlike state medical cannabis laws, which may restrict the form of cannabis\nproducts available, recreational laws permit production and sale of most common forms of cannabis\nproducts, including a wide variety of flower, concentrates and infused products.\nState recreational laws designate state agencies to issue commercial cannabis licenses and regulate\nparticipants in the cannabis supply chain. Some of these agencies are newly established specifically to\nregulate cannabis, such as California’s Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) or Massachusetts’s Cannabis\nControl Commission. Others are existing state agencies (and typically oversee tax or alcohol matters),\nsuch as Nevada’s Department of Taxation or Oregon’s Liquor Control Commission. These agencies\nalso may regulate state medical cannabis industries, as do Colorado’s Marijuana Enforcement Division,\nWashington’s Liquor and Cannabis Board and California’s BCC.\nState regulatory agencies issue separate licenses for different types of commercial cannabis activities.\nCommon categories of licenses include cultivation, production, manufacturing, distribution, transportation,\nlaboratory testing and retail. A state may further provide for multiple types of licenses within a\ncategory. For example, California’s recreational law provides for 12 types of cultivation licenses, which\nvary according to factors such as the size of a cultivation facility and indoor or outdoor cultivation.\nMost states allow companies to hold licenses in multiple categories, thereby allowing vertically integrated\ncultivation, manufacturing and retail businesses. Washington is an exception—in most cases, a\nbusiness is prohibited from holding licenses across categories. Even states that allow vertical integration\ntypically prohibit the holder of a laboratory testing license from holding licenses in other categories.\nState laws give significant power to counties and municipalities to impose zoning and permitting\nrequirements that may severely restrict or prohibit cannabis activities. California requires a state-license\napplicant to demonstrate it has all permits, licenses and approvals required under local law, and many\nCalifornia cities and counties have effectively banned the recreational cannabis industry. Massachusetts\nallows towns that voted “No” on the state’s recreational law to ban cannabis businesses through\nDecember 2019 and requires other towns that wish to prohibit cannabis businesses to do so through\na local ballot initiative.\nEach state has chosen to levy significant taxes on the recreational cannabis industry, and some state laws\nauthorize local governments to levy additional cannabis-related taxes. Nevada imposes a 15% excise tax on\ncannabis wholesales by cultivators and a 10% excise tax on retail sales. Oregon and Massachusetts charge\na state excise tax of 17% and 10.75%, respectively, and each state authorizes local governments to levy up\nto another 3%. Washington originally imposed a 25% excise tax on cannabis sales at each of three different\npoints in the supply chain—grower to processor, processor to retailer and retailer to consumer—but now\ncharges a single 37% tax on retail sales. California imposes a 15% excise tax. All state and local cannabisspecific\nexcise taxes are in addition to normal state and local sales tax. Although the possibility of generating\nsignificant tax revenue is one reason state governments have embraced legal cannabis, some\nproponents of legalization argue that high tax rates will keep consumer prices high and discourage\nconsumer transition to legalized markets.\n66 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nState governments continue to adjust recreational cannabis regulations in an effort to create favorable\nindustry conditions and address health and public safety concerns. State-licensed recreational\ncannabis businesses must comply with a host of requirements related to security (such as video surveillance,\nalarm system requirements and owner/operator criminal background checks), product diversion\n(particularly seed-to-sale tracking requirements), product safety and quality (including product\nlabeling requirements and potency and contaminant testing), and general business operations (such as\nrestrictions on advertising and compliance with energy and environmental standards).\nn U.S. Federal Law\nCurrent federal law effectively prohibits all cannabis use and all commercial cannabis activity in the\nUnited States. Producing, selling and possessing cannabis are federal crimes. No cannabis-derived drug\nhas ever been federally approved for use in treating any medical condition. Otherwise legitimate business\ntransactions conducted by cannabis companies—and their banks, for those who can access banking\nservices—are legally suspect. Certain intellectual property and bankruptcy protections critical to\nmany U.S. businesses are not available to cannabis companies. Cannabis companies pay federal income\ntax at effective rates significantly higher than other businesses.\nDespite official prohibition, federal policies and laws recently passed by the U.S. Congress have\ncarved out a limited space in which the state-legal cannabis industry has managed to thrive. Enforcement\npolicies published by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) have unofficially invited cannabis\nbusiness to proceed if certain conditions are respected. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (DOT)\nestablished reporting policies that create room for banks to service the cannabis industry. Federal budget\nlegislation has prevented allocated funds from being used to prosecute conduct that complies with\nstate medical cannabis laws.\nRecent developments indicate that the federal government may be pursuing policies and practices\nthat create space for cannabis research and approval of cannabis-derived drugs. In particular, the U.S.\nDrug Enforcement Agency (DEA) adopted a new policy in 2016 designed to increase the number of\nDEA-registered cannabis cultivators (there has been only one such cultivator for nearly 50 years). And\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reviewing a New Drug Application (NDA) submitted\nin October 2017 for what could be the first ever cannabis-derived pharmaceutical approved by the\nfederal government.\nThe following chart shows three general areas of federal law that impact the cannabis industry—food\nand drug regulation, banking and finance, and intellectual property—as well as specific\nlaws and federal policies related to each of the areas discussed later in this chapter.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 67\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nFederal Laws and Policies Impacting the Cannabis Industry\nControlled\nSubstances\nAct\nJustice\nDepartment\nCole Memo\nBank Secrecy Act\nand Financial\nTransaction\nLaws\nRohrabacher-\nBlumenauer\nAmendment\nTreasury\nDepartment\nFinCEN Memo\nAgricultural\nAct\nof 2014\nDRUG\nAND FOOD\nREGULATION\nFederal Laws\nand Policies\nImpacting the\nCannabis\nIndustry\nBANKING\nAND\nFINANCE\nSecurities\nLaw\nBankruptcy\nLaw\nFood, Drug,\nand\nCosmetic Act\nINTELLECTUAL\nPROPERTY\nInternal\nRevenue\nCode\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC\nPatent\nAct\nPlant\nVariety\nProtection\nAct\nTrademark\nAct\nControlled Substances Act\nThe Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is a federal law enacted in 1970 that places strict legal controls\non the manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of any controlled substance listed on one\nof five schedules established by the CSA. The CSA is enforced primarily by the U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Justice. A controlled substance may be manufactured,\ndistributed or dispensed in accordance with the CSA only by a person properly registered\n68 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nwith the DEA. Any person that manufactures, distributes, dispenses or otherwise possesses a controlled\nsubstance in violation of the CSA is subject to civil and criminal penalties.\nThe CSA schedules are numbered I to V. Schedule I substances are subject to the strictest controls,\nand Schedule V substances are subject to the least restrictive controls. A controlled substance is listed\non a particular schedule according to four factors:\n(i) The substance’s potential for abuse.\n(ii) Whether the substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United\nStates.\n(iii) Whether the substance is accepted as safe to use under medical supervision.\n(iv) The degree of physical and psychological dependence that may result from abuse of the\nsubstance.\nUpon enactment in 1970, the CSA assigned each controlled substance to a specific schedule. The\nU.S. Congress may legislate a controlled substance’s addition to or removal from a CSA schedule. The\nCSA also provides a regulatory framework for a substance to be added to or removed from a schedule;\nsuch change generally involves a recommendation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices (DHHS) and concurrence with that recommendation by the DEA. The U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration, an agency of the DHHS, is charged with making certain safety-related determinations\nused in DHHS scheduling recommendations.\nSchedule I controlled substances are those found by the U.S. Congress or the DEA and the DHHS\nto have a high potential for abuse, to have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United\nStates and to have a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Current Schedule I substances\ninclude marijuana, THC, heroin, ecstasy, LSD and peyote. Unlike Schedule II through Schedule\nV controlled substances, which can be prescribed by a doctor, the CSA does not allow prescriptions\nto be written for Schedule I controlled substances.\nMarijuana\nMarijuana has been a Schedule I controlled substance since enactment of the CSA in 1970. The CSA\ndefines “marijuana” as\nall parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the\nresin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,\nmixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. Such term does not include\nthe mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from\nthe seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or\npreparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake,\nor the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination.\nThe parts and derivatives of the cannabis plant that are excluded from the CSA definition of\nmarijuana have industrial uses and generally contain little or no THC. Non-marijuana cannabis\nproducts—commonly known as hemp products—including rope, clothing, animal feed and soap,\nare not subject to control under the CSA. The CSA does not restrict such non-marijuana products\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 69\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nfrom being imported into the United States. However, because the production of such non-marijuana\nproducts ordinarily involves possession of the entire cannabis plant, including parts deemed marijuana\nunder the CSA, the CSA effectively prohibits such production in the United States without DEA\nregistration.\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC)\nIn addition to and separate from marijuana’s listing on Schedule I, tetrahydrocannabinol 1 (THC) has\nbeen listed on Schedule I since the CSA’s enactment in 1970. From 1970 until 2003, DEA regulations\ndefined THC for purposes of its separate Schedule I listing as including only “synthetic equivalents”\nof the THC found in the cannabis plant. In 2003, the DEA purportedly amended this regulatory\ndefinition of THC to include both synthetic equivalents of THC and THC occurring naturally in the\ncannabis plant. In its 2004 holding in Hemp Industries Association v. DEA, the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit enjoined DEA enforcement of this purported amendment and held that the\nTHC listed separately from marijuana on Schedule I includes only synthetic THC and that any THC\noccurring naturally within the cannabis plant is controlled under the CSA only if it falls within the\nCSA definition of marijuana.\nPenalties for CSA Violations\nFederal penalties for violating CSA provisions regarding marijuana or THC include fines and imprisonment.\nCSA violations may also result in federal seizure of cash and other assets related to the violations.\nCSA penalties may apply to cannabis businesses that violate the CSA and also to individuals who own\nor operate such businesses based on attempt, accomplice, conspiracy and criminal enterprise provisions\nincluded in the CSA.\nNew DEA Registration Policy\nFor nearly 50 years, only one cannabis cultivation site in the United States has operated with the\nrequired DEA registration. The site is operated by the University of Mississippi under a contract with\nthe National Institute on Drug Abuse to supply the country’s entire stock of federally legal cannabis,\nwhich is used exclusively for research. In August 2016, the DEA announced a new policy designed\nto increase the number of DEA-registered cannabis cultivators and permit-registered cultivators to\ngrow cannabis for privately funded commercial drug development projects. The DEA announcement\nacknowledged the increasing interest in conducting cannabis research related to commercial pursuits,\nand indicated that the best way to satisfy the increased demand was to increase the number of\nDEA-registered cultivators. The DEA has since accepted at least 25 applications for registration but has\nnot issued any new registrations.\n1\nCSA Schedule I uses the plural form “tetrahydrocannabinols” to describe a category of substances that includes chemical derivatives\nand isomers. This report adopts the more commonly used singular form, “tetrahydrocannabinol.”\n70 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nU.S. Department of Justice: The Cole Memo\nA memorandum published by the DOJ in August 2013 (Cole Memo) provides guidance to DOJ attorneys\nand federal law enforcement about prosecuting cannabis-related federal offenses. The Cole Memo\nasserts that marijuana is a dangerous drug, that illegal distribution of marijuana is a serious crime which\nprovides revenue to criminal enterprises and that the DOJ is committed to enforcing marijuana-related\nviolations of federal law. The Cole Memo also notes, however, that the DOJ is committed to using\nits limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most\neffective, consistent and rational way.\nThe Cole Memo guides DOJ attorneys and federal law enforcement to focus on the following\neight enforcement priorities when considering prosecutions for marijuana-related CSA violations (and\nalso, according to a Cole Memo update issued in February 2014, when considering prosecutions for\nmarijuana-related violations of the federal money laundering statute, the unlicensed money transmitter\nstatute and the Bank Secrecy Act):\n1. Preventing distribution of marijuana to minors.\n2. Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and\ncartels.\n3. Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some\nform to other states.\n4. Preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the\ntrafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity.\n5. Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana.\n6. Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences\nassociated with marijuana use.\n7. Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and\nenvironmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands.\n8. Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.\nThe Cole Memo notes that whether marijuana-related conduct implicates any of these enforcement\npriorities should be a primary question in considering prosecution and that in states with legalized\nmarijuana and effective regulatory systems, conduct in compliance with state law is less likely to\nthreaten these priorities.\nThe Cole Memo has provided some comfort to those operating state-legal cannabis businesses that\ndo not interfere with the enumerated enforcement priorities. However, the Cole Memo merely reflects\ninternal guidance within the DOJ and does not create a legal defense for any violation of federal law.\nDuring the January 2017 Senate confirmation hearings for current U.S. Attorney General Jeff\nSessions, in a discussion about the enforcement priorities outlined in the Cole Memo, Mr. Sessions\nacknowledged the “problem of resources for the federal government” and stated that he thought some\nof the enforcement priorities were “truly valuable in evaluating cases,” but he also stated that he would\nnot commit to never enforcing federal law.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 71\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nRohrabacher-Farr Amendment\nThe Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, first passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President\nObama in 2014, prohibits the DOJ from using federal funds to prevent a state from “implementing”\nstate laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical marijuana.\nFollowing the amendment’s initial 2014 enactment, the DOJ indicated that it did not plan to arrest\nstate regulators for “implementing” a state’s medical marijuana laws but would continue to prosecute\nindividuals involved in state-law compliant medical marijuana activity because, in the DOJ’s view, the\namendment did not apply to prosecutions against individuals.\nThe DOJ’s interpretation of the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment was rejected by a Ninth Circuit\nDistrict Court in its 2015 ruling in United States v. Marin Alliance for Medical Marijuana, and again by\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in its 2016 ruling in United States v. McIntosh. The Ninth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals held the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment prohibits DOJ from spending funds subject\nto the amendment on the prosecution of individuals who fully comply with state medical marijuana\nlaws. The court noted a state’s “implementation” of medical marijuana laws necessarily involves “giving\npractical effect” to those laws, and that DOJ prosecution of individuals complying with those laws\nprevents the state from giving the laws practical effect.\nThe Rohrabacher-Farr amendment generally applies only to DOJ funds made available pursuant\nto the federal budget legislation in which the amendment is included, and therefore must be\nrenewed periodically with budget legislation to remain effective. The Rohrabacher-Farr amendment\nwas recently renewed in December 2017 as part of an emergency aid package that remains effective\nuntil mid-January 2018. (With the retirement of Representative Samuel Farr from the U.S. Congress\nin 2016, the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment is now also referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer\namendment; we use this name elsewhere in this report.)\nAgricultural Act of 2014\nThe Agricultural Act of 2014 (Farm Bill) authorizes institutions of higher education and state departments\nof agriculture to cultivate industrial hemp, CSA controls notwithstanding, if (i) the industrial\nhemp is cultivated for purposes of research conducted under an agricultural pilot program or other\nagricultural or academic research and (ii) the cultivation is allowed under the laws of the state in which\nsuch institution of higher education or state department of agriculture is located and such research\noccurs.\nThe Farm Bill defines “industrial hemp” as the cannabis plant and any part of such plant, whether\ngrowing or not, with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.\nIndustrial hemp, like any cannabis plant, may comprise both marijuana (as defined in the CSA) and\nnon-marijuana. But the Farm Bill creates an exception to CSA controls on marijuana, so cultivation in\naccordance with the Farm Bill of marijuana that qualifies as industrial hemp does not violate the CSA.\nThe following table summarizes the legal relationship between marijuana (as defined in the CSA)\nand industrial hemp (as defined in the Farm Bill).\n72 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nU.S. Legal Relationship between Marijuana and Industrial Hemp\nNon-Industrial Hemp\nCannabis plant and all parts and\nderivatives except industrial hemp\nMarijuana\nCannabis plant and all parts and\nderivatives except non-marijuana\n• Manufacture, distribution, dispensing\nand possession controlled under CSA\n• No Farm Bill exception to CSA\nNon-Marijuana\nMature stalks; fiber made from mature stalks;\noil or cake made from seeds; compounds,\nmanufactures, salts, mixtures, preparations\nor derivatives of the foregoing parts and\nderivatives (except resin extracted from mature\nstalks); sterilized seeds\n• No CSA controls\n• Farm Bill exception to CSA moot\nIndustrial Hemp\nCannabis plant and any part with THC\nconcentration not more than 0.3% on\na dry weight basis\n• Manufacture, distribution, dispensing\nand possession controlled under CSA\n(but subject to Farm Bill exception)\n• Farm Bill exception to CSA controls:\nstate-legal cultivation by an institution of\nhigher education or a state department\nof agriculture for research\n• No CSA controls\n• Farm Bill exception to CSA moot\nIndustrial hemp can be used to produce CBD oil, an extract of the cannabis plant with a high\nconcentration of cannabidiol (CBD) but little or no psychoactive THC. CBD oil is believed to have a\nrange of medicinal benefits and therapeutic applications. Some have argued that the Farm Bill federally\nlegalizes the production and sale of CBD oil. However, it is unclear whether CBD oil produced from\nindustrial hemp is itself considered industrial hemp (the CSA defines marijuana by reference to the\ncannabis plant, parts of the plant and derivatives of the plant, whereas the Farm Bill exception to the\nCSA defines industrial hemp by reference only to the plant and parts of the plant, but does not mention\nderivatives). Even if CBD oil is considered industrial hemp and may be lawfully produced under\nthe Farm Bill, only institutions of higher education and state departments of agriculture are authorized\nto produce it, and then only for purposes of agricultural or academic research; thus the Farm Bill likely\ndoes not create a CSA exception broad enough for large-scale commercial production and distribution\nof CBD oil within the United States.\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\nThe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) is a federal law enacted in 1938 (and since\namended multiple times) that authorizes the FDA to regulate the safety and effectiveness of drugs and\nmedical devices and the safety of food, tobacco products and cosmetics. The FD&C Act prohibits the\n“adulteration or misbranding” of any drug, medical device, food, tobacco product or cosmetic (which\nthe act generally refers to as “articles”) in interstate commerce and prohibits interstate commerce in any\nsuch adulterated or misbranded article. The FD&C Act also prohibits the “introduction or delivery for\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 73\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nintroduction into interstate commerce” of any drug, medical device, food, tobacco product or cosmetic\nundertaken without the required FDA approval, permit or registration.\nAn article that includes cannabis or a cannabis derivative could conceivably qualify as a drug, medical\ndevice, food, tobacco product or cosmetic (or a combination). For example, a skin lubricant infused\nwith cannabis extract and intended to relieve muscle pain may be both a cosmetic and a drug, and a\nprefilled device used to administer a metered dose of vaporized THC for treating nausea may be both\na medical device and a drug. Industry dialogue regarding the FD&C Act and the FDA tends to focus\non cannabinoid-based drugs and the potential for certain cannabis products to be regulated as food or\na related category of products known as “dietary supplements,” and we expand on both topics in the\nfollowing discussion.\nDrugs\nGenerally, the FD&C Act defines a “drug” as any one of the following:\n(i) Any article recognized in the official U.S. Pharmacopoeia, U.S. Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia\nor National Formulary.\n(ii) Any article intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of\ndisease in humans or animals.\n(iii) Any article (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body\nof humans or animals.\n(iv) Any article intended as a component of any of the foregoing.\nThe FDA oversees the manufacturing of drugs by inspecting domestic and foreign manufacturing\nplants, by sampling drugs from retail stores, distribution warehouses and manufacturing plants and by\nevaluating complaints and reports of defects from consumers and health care professionals. The FD&C\nAct generally prohibits a company from introducing a drug into interstate commerce without the FDA\nhaving first approved the drug as safe and effective for treating a specified medical condition.\nFDA approval of a drug as safe and effective for treating a specified medical condition generally\ninvolves the following steps:\n(i) The drug’s manufacturer performs laboratory and animal tests to determine how the drug\nworks and whether it is safe enough to test on humans.\n(ii) If the manufacturer determines the drug is safe enough to test on humans, then the manufacturer\nsubmits for FDA review an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.\n(iii) Upon review of the IND application, if the FDA determines the drug is safe enough to test\non humans, then the FDA approves the manufacturer to proceed with human clinical trials.\n(iv) The manufacturer performs a series of human clinical trials and submits the resulting data\nfor FDA review in the form of a New Drug Application (NDA). Upon review of the NDA,\nif the FDA determines the drug’s benefits outweigh its known risks and the drug can be\nmanufactured in a way that ensures a quality product, then the drug is approved as safe and\neffective for treating the specified medical condition.\n74 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nA drug generally may not be marketed for treating a condition other than a condition for which the\nFDA has found the drug to be a safe and effective treatment; however, most FDA-approved drugs can\nbe prescribed by doctors to treat other conditions (so-called “off-label” prescriptions).\nNonprescription or over-the-counter drugs can be marketed after receiving FDA approval through\nthe NDA process or by conforming the drug to an existing over-the-counter “monograph” (a “recipe\nbook” indicating acceptable ingredients, doses, formulations and labeling) established by the FDA.\nCannabinoid-Based Drugs\nSeveral drugs containing synthetic cannabinoids or cannabinoid-like compounds have been approved\nby the FDA. Marinol, a drug comprised of dronabinol (a synthetic THC) encapsulated with sesame oil\nin a soft gelatin capsule, was approved by the FDA in 1985 for treatment of nausea and vomiting associated\nwith cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional\nantiemetic treatments. It was later approved, in 1992, for treatment of anorexia associated with weight\nloss in patients with AIDS. Syndros, a drug comprised of dronabinol in a liquid solution, was approved\nby the FDA in 2016 for treatment of the same symptoms for which Marinol was approved. Cesamet,\na drug comprised of encapsulated nabilone (a synthetic cannabinoid similar to THC), was approved\nby the FDA in 1985 for treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemo therapy in\npatients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments.\nEach of the drugs Marinol, Syndros and Cesamet was placed on CSA Schedule II within one to\ntwo years after its initial FDA approval (Marinol and Syndros were rescheduled from Schedule I upon\nrecommendation of the DHHS, and Cesamet’s placement on Schedule II was its initial CSA classification).\nSchedule II through Schedule V substances can be prescribed by a doctor, but the CSA does not\npermit prescriptions for Schedule I substances, so removal of an FDA-approved drug from Schedule I\nis required before the drug can be prescribed legally.\nThe FDA has not approved any drug derived from the cannabis plant. However, two such drugs,\nSativex and Epidiolex (both manufactured by U.K.-based GW Pharmaceuticals), have advanced\nthrough certain stages of the FDA approval process. Sativex is a mouth spray used for treatment of\nspasticity caused by multiple sclerosis; it includes THC and CBD derived from cannabis. Epidiolex\nis an oral formulation of cannabis-derived CBD intended to treat severe forms of childhood epilepsy.\nHuman clinical trials have been conducted with both drugs, and although an NDA has not been submitted\nfor Sativex, an NDA for Epidiolex was submitted to the FDA in October 2017. If approved by\nthe FDA, Epidiolex would be the first FDA-approved pharmaceutical derived from cannabis.\nFoods and Dietary Supplements\nGenerally, the FD&C Act defines “food” as (i) any article used for food or drink for humans or animals,\n(ii) chewing gum, and (iii) any article used as a component of any of the foregoing. The FD&C Act\ndefines a “dietary supplement” generally as either (i) a product intended to supplement the diet that\ncontains certain dietary ingredients (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, or\nother substances used by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake) or (ii) a\nproduct intended for ingestion in tablet, capsule, powder, softgel, gelcap, or liquid form and labeled as\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 75\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\na dietary supplement but not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or\nthe diet. A dietary supplement generally is deemed to be a food under the FD&C Act.\nThe FD&C Act does not require foods or food labels to be pre-approved by the FDA, but it does\ngive the FDA broad authority to regulate the safety of food and food labels and to prevent interstate\ncommerce in adulterated or misbranded food. Facilities engaged in manufacturing, processing, packing\nor holding food for consumption in the United States are required to be registered with the FDA.\nThe FD&C Act requires most foods to bear nutrition labeling and requires food labels that bear\nnutrient content claims and certain health messages to comply with specific requirements. The FDA is\nauthorized to enforce safety and labeling regulations by conducting inspections, sampling, recalls and\nseizures, and by pursuing injunctions and criminal prosecutions.\nCannabis-Based Foods and Dietary Supplements\nThe FDA has published guidance (most recently updated in August 2017) concluding that (i) the\nFD&C Act does not permit foods to which THC or CBD have been added to be sold in interstate\ncommerce and (ii) any product containing THC or CBD is not a dietary supplement. For this conclusion\nto be legally correct, based on the FD&C Act provisions cited by the FDA, it would need to be\ndemonstrated that neither THC nor CBD were marketed in or as a food or as a dietary supplement\nbefore the occurrence of certain approvals and clinical investigations of drugs that include THC (e.g.,\nMarinol) or CBD (e.g., Sativex or Epidiolex). The FDA publication does not demonstrate that neither\nTHC nor CBD were marketed in or as a food or as a dietary supplement before such occurrences and\nmerely states that the FDA is “not aware of any evidence that would call into question” its conclusion.\nThe FDA’s conclusion has not been subject to any legal challenge, and it remains unresolved whether\ncertain cannabis-based products, particularly hemp-derived CBD products, might be regulated by the\nFDA as foods or dietary supplements rather than as drugs.\nFDA Policy and Enforcement\nIn December 2016, the FDA published a document titled Botanical Drug Development; Guidance for\nIndustry that discusses several areas in which, due to the unique nature of botanical drugs, the FDA\nbelieves it is appropriate to apply regulatory policies that differ from those applied to nonbotanical\ndrugs. The guidance discusses challenges inherent to botanical drugs, including challenges related to\nensuring therapeutic consistency, and suggests certain steps to address those challenges. The guidance\nwas published only months after the DEA announced a new policy designed to increase the number\nof DEA-registered cannabis cultivators and permit-registered cultivators to grow cannabis for privately\nfunded commercial drug development projects. These parallel developments indicate to some that the\nfederal government is opening a pathway to federal approval of cannabis-derived drugs.\nThe FDA has the legal authority under the FD&C Act and related regulations to significantly disrupt\nthe state-legal cannabis industry in the United States. The FDA has issued warning letters during\nthe past several years to distributors of hemp-based CBD products but has not broadly enforced federal\nlaw against the cannabis industry. A cannabis-focused publication on the FDA website states that\nin deciding whether to initiate federal enforcement, the FDA may consult with its federal and state\n76 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\npartners and consider many factors, including FDA resources and threats to public health. Beyond\nthis statement, the FDA has not published detailed guidance about its cannabis-related enforcement\npriorities.\nBank Secrecy Act and Other Federal Laws\nRegarding Financial Transactions\nFinancial transactions in connection with cannabis-related CSA violations may implicate federal laws\nother than the CSA itself, including the federal money laundering statute, the federal unlicensed money\ntransmitter statute and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).\nThe federal money laundering statute imposes penalties on any person who conducts or attempts\ncertain financial or monetary transactions involving the proceeds of a “continuing criminal enterprise”\n(a term, used in the CSA, that arguably encompasses many cannabis businesses). Violations of the\nfederal money laundering statute may result in fines equal to twice the value of the property involved\nin the transaction (or $500,000, if greater) and imprisonment for up to 20 years.\nThe federal unlicensed money transmitter statute makes it illegal for any person to operate or own\na money transmitter business that involves the transportation or transmission of funds known to have\nbeen derived from or intended to promote or support criminal violations of the CSA. Violations of the\nlaw may result in fines and imprisonment for up to 5 years.\nThe BSA requires banks and other financial institutions to maintain certain records and to file\ncertain reports deemed useful in criminal, tax or regulatory proceedings or in government intelligence\nand counterterrorism activities. Federal regulations under the BSA require financial institutions to\nfile with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of\nthe Treasury charged with administering the BSA, a suspicious activity report (SAR) if the financial\ninstitution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect that a transaction conducted or attempted by, at or\nthrough the financial institution involves or is an attempt to disguise funds derived from illegal activity,\nis designed to evade BSA regulations or lacks an apparent lawful purpose. Financial institutions and\ntheir principals are subject to civil and criminal penalties for violations of the BSA.\nU.S. Treasury Department: The FinCEN Memo\nIn coordination with the February 2014 Cole Memo update, FinCEN published a memorandum\n(FinCEN Memo) outlining how banks and other financial institutions can, consistent with their BSA\nobligations, provide services to marijuana-related businesses. The FinCEN Memo directs each financial\ninstitution to consider its own business objectives and the risks associated with offering a particular\nproduct or service when considering whether to commence or continue a customer relationship with\na marijuana-related business. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of due diligence and outlines\na procedure for filing SARs for such businesses.\nThe FinCEN Memo guides financial institutions to conduct a due diligence review of a customer’s\nbusiness that includes an evaluation of whether the customer relationship implicates (or would implicate)\nany Cole Memo priority and also includes the following investigations:\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 77\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\n1. Verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and\nregistered.\n2. Reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for\nobtaining a state license to operate its marijuana-related business.\n3. Requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the\nbusiness and related parties.\n4. Developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including\nthe types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (for example, medical\nversus recreational customers).\n5. Ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business\nand related parties.\n6. Ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for certain red flags described in the\nFinCEN Memo.\n7. Refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and\ncommensurate with the risk.\nThe FinCEN Memo also guides financial institutions to file various SARs with FinCEN regarding\ncustomers engaged in marijuana-related businesses. According to the memorandum, an institution\nshould file (i) a “Marijuana Limited” SAR for each customer it believes does not violate state law or\nimplicate any Cole Memo priority, (ii) a “Marijuana Priority” SAR for each customer it believes violates\nstate law or implicates any Cole Memo priority, and (iii) a “Marijuana Termination” SAR if the\ninstitution decides to terminate a customer relationship in order to maintain an effective anti–money\nlaundering compliance program. The FinCEN Memo outlines certain “red flags” that tend to indicate\nwhich type of SAR filing is appropriate; red flags include the inability of a customer to demonstrate\ncompliance with state law or deposits of amounts of cash inconsistent with its tax returns.\nFinCEN periodically publishes information about marijuana-related SAR filings made by depository\ninstitutions. From the February 2014 FinCEN Memo publication through June 30, 2017,\nFinCEN received a total of 33,692 marijuana-related SAR filings from a total of 390 banks and credit\nunions. The following graphs based on FinCEN data show the number of monthly Marijuana Limited,\nMarijuana Priority and Marijuana Termination SAR filings for this period and the number of banks\nand credit unions making such filings.\n78 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nMonthly Marijuana-Related SAR Filings\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nQ2 2014 Q4 2014 Q2 2015 Q4 2015 Q2 2016 Q4 2016 Q2 2017\nLimited Priority Termination\nDepository Institutions Making Marijuana-Related SAR Filings\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nQ2 2014 Q4 2014 Q2 2015 Q4 2015 Q2 2016 Q4 2016 Q2 2017\nBanks\nCredit Unions\nSource: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\nThe upward trend in the frequency of marijuana-related SAR filings, as well as the growing number\nof depository institutions making such filings, indicate cannabis businesses increasingly are accessing\nthe federal banking system despite federal law.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 79\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nThe California State Treasurer’s Cannabis Banking Working Group—a panel convened by California\nState Treasurer John Chiang that includes representatives from the cannabis industry and financial\ninstitutions, and government tax collection, law enforcement and regulatory agencies—issued a report\nin November 2017 on the cannabis industry’s banking challenges. In the report, the State Treasurer’s\nOffice stated that the cannabis industry’s lack of access to banking services is one of the biggest threats\nto the success of the state’s recreational cannabis law, which is scheduled for implementation starting\nin January 2018. Based on the working group’s findings, the State Treasurer’s Office recommended the\nfollowing four actions:\n1. Implementation of safer, more effective, and scalable ways to handle the payment of taxes and\nfees in cash that minimize risks to stakeholders.\n2. Development by the State of California and local governments of a data portal of compliance\nand regulatory data to be made available to financial institutions that bank cannabis businesses.\n3. Conduct a feasibility study of a public bank or other state-backed financial institution that\nprovides banking services to the cannabis industry.\n4. Establish a multistate consortium of state government representatives and other stakeholders\nto pursue changes to federal law in order to remove the barriers to cannabis banking.\nThe State Treasurer’s Office also stated it was apparent that a definitive solution to the cannabis\nbanking quandary will remain elusive until the federal government removes cannabis from its official\nlist of dangerous drugs or the U.S. Congress approves safe harbor legislation protecting financial institutions\nthat serve cannabis businesses from federal penalties.\nFederal Securities Law\nThe U.S. securities markets and industry participants are regulated principally under two federal laws:\nthe Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).\nThe Securities Act regulates the offer and sale of securities by issuers, and the Exchange Act regulates\nsecurities firms, stock exchanges, reporting by publicly traded companies and investing and trading\npractices of investors. The Exchange Act also establishes the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC), a federal agency charged with enforcing federal securities laws.\nFederal securities laws are intended to facilitate capital formation, maintain fair and efficient markets,\nand protect investors. The laws are based on a philosophy of disclosure: issuers of securities\ngenerally are obligated to completely and truthfully disclose material information to investors and\nthe market, and failure to satisfy that obligation may result in civil or criminal penalties. Information\ngenerally required to be disclosed includes audited financial statements, discussions of risks applicable\nto the issuer and investors in its securities, and details of conflicts of interest faced by the issuer’s officers\nand directors.\nFederal securities laws related to private offerings provide fewer investor protections than laws\nrelated to public offerings and generally assume investors in private offerings can “fend for themselves.”\nAn issuer of securities in a private offering is not subject to the same extensive reporting requirements\n80 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nas publicly traded companies, but ordinarily will market its securities using a private placement memorandum\n(PPM) that includes information similar to some of the information required to be disclosed\nby publicly traded companies. An issuer in a private placement is subject to liability under federal securities\nlaws for misrepresentation or fraudulent statements made in a PPM or otherwise in connection\nwith the private offering.\nBy all indications, federal securities laws do not prohibit companies engaged in federally illegal\ncannabis activities from raising capital through the issuance of securities, nor do they prohibit industry\nparticipants like stock exchanges and investment banks from performing their ordinary market functions\nin connection with such companies. The SEC has allowed the registration and sale of securities\noffered by companies engaged in federally illegal cannabis activities and the trading of those securities\non multiple U.S. stock markets. Although the SEC has on occasion suspended trading in some of\nthese securities, those suspensions generally have been due to alleged violations of securities regulations\nrather than unlawful cannabis activities.\nA cannabis company offering or selling securities must comply with federal securities laws—like\nany other issuer—by making required notice or registration filings and by providing truthful material\ninformation to investors. Any discussion of risks delivered to investors, whether required by securities\nlaws or volunteered by the issuer as part of a private offering, should include a thorough discussion of\nthe unique risks posed by operating a cannabis business engaged in federally illegal conduct. For an\nexample of some of these risks, refer to Chapter IX, Cannabis Industry Risk Factors.\nFederal Bankruptcy Law\nBankruptcy is a legal proceeding by which a debtor resolves its debt obligations and creditors are\nafforded certain rights in the debtor’s assets in full or partial satisfaction of the debts owed to them. In\nthe United States, bankruptcy is governed primarily by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (Bankruptcy\nCode). Bankruptcy proceedings are conducted primarily by federal bankruptcy courts and generally\ninvolve administration of a debtor’s assets either by a court-appointed trustee or by the debtor\nwith approval and oversight of the court. Bankruptcy can be voluntary (initiated by the debtor) or\ninvoluntary (initiated by creditors). Bankruptcy provides certain rights and protections to the debtor\nand the creditors and is intended to fairly and finally resolve debts so the parties can pursue other\naffairs.\nDebtors whose assets relate to federally illegal cannabis activity, as well as their creditors, generally\nare not eligible for bankruptcy protection for two reasons: First, federal courts refuse to appoint\ntrustees to administer or take control of unlawful assets or business operations. Second, pursuant to\nan equitable doctrine known as “unclean hands,” federal courts typically decline to honor creditor\nclaims that arise from knowingly transacting with a debtor in furtherance of unlawful activity. A federal\nbankruptcy court in Arizona invoked both these reasons in its 2015 decision in In Re Medpoint Management,\nLLC; details of this case follow.\nMedpoint Management, LLC (Medpoint) managed the cultivation and business operations of a\nstate-legal Arizona medical cannabis dispensary. Medpoint defaulted under various loan and consulting\nagreements directly related to its dispensary activities, and the four creditors under those agreements\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 81\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nfiled a petition for involuntary bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court dismissed the petition, stating it\nwould not assign a trustee “to administer drug tainted assets for the benefit of creditors who assumed\nthe risk of doing business with an enterprise engaged in violations of federal law.” Federal courts in\nCalifornia, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan have applied the same rationale to dismiss bankruptcy\nproceedings involving illegal cannabis-related assets.\nState law alternatives to federal bankruptcy that may be available to cannabis businesses and their\ncreditors include an assignment for the benefit of creditors (ABC) and receivership. An ABC is a statelaw\nprocess for the orderly and controlled liquidation of a debtor’s assets through a neutral, third party\nadministrator. Receivership is a remedy whereby a court appoints a receiver to take possession of and\nprotect property for the benefit of all concerned parties. In the state of Washington, for example, at\nleast one medical cannabis business is reported to have successfully concluded a receivership process.\nInternal Revenue Code\nThe Internal Revenue Code (IRC) defines gross income to include “all income from whatever source\nderived”; this definition has been interpreted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S.\nSupreme Court to include income derived from unlawful activities. Consequently, cannabis businesses\nthat violate the CSA and other federal laws related to cannabis nonetheless must file federal income tax\nreturns and pay federal income tax.\nA business generally computes its taxable income in two steps. First, the business computes its gross\nincome by subtracting from its gross receipts the cost of goods sold (COGS), which includes the cost of\nacquiring, constructing or extracting a physical product that is to be sold. The subtraction of COGS to\ncompute gross income is premised on constitutional grounds and cannot be changed by federal statutes\nor IRS regulations. Second, the IRC “allows” a business to deduct from gross income all ordinary and\nnecessary business expenses, which generally include all business expenses other than COGS, such as\nemployee salaries, payments to contractors, marketing costs, insurance premiums, and the cost of rent\nand utilities. But there are exceptions to this “allowed” deduction. One such exception is provided by\nIRC section 280E (Section 280E).\nSection 280E disallows any deduction or credit for any amount paid or incurred in carrying on\na “trade or business” that consists of unlawful “trafficking” in a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled\nsubstance. Although Section 280E does not prevent a cannabis business from subtracting COGS to\ncompute gross income, it may prevent the deduction of all other business expenses for purposes of\ncomputing taxable income. As a result of Section 280E, businesses in the cannabis industry may have\neffective tax rates significantly higher than other businesses subject to federal income tax.\nThe scope of Section 280E, as it applies to U.S. cannabis businesses, is the subject of recent and\nongoing federal court cases. The U.S. Tax Court has adopted the view (a view endorsed by the U.S.\nSupreme Court) that a “trade or business” is any activity entered into with the dominant hope and\nintent of realizing a profit, and it has indicated in multiple rulings that dispensing or buying and selling\nmarijuana involves unlawful “trafficking” in a Schedule I controlled substance.\n82 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nA trade or business that consists of unlawful cannabis trafficking may comprise a separate division\nof a single taxpayer, as was found by the U.S. Tax Court in its 2007 decision in Californians Helping\nto Alleviate Medical Problems, Inc. v. Commissioner, in which case Section 280E does not prevent the\ntaxpayer from deducting business expenses attributable to other lawful trades or businesses it conducts.\nOr, all of a taxpayer’s activities may constitute a single trade or business subject to 280E even though\nthe taxpayer conducts some lawful business transactions not involving cannabis, as was found by the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in its 2017 decision in Canna Care, Inc. v. Commissioner.\nPatent Act\nTitle 35 of the U.S. Code (Patent Act) is the federal statute that governs patents in the United States.\nA patent issued under the Patent Act is the right to exclude others in the United States from making,\nusing, importing, offering for sale or selling an “invention or discovery” and, if the invention or\ndiscovery is a process, products made by that process. U.S. patents are issued by the U.S. Patent and\nTrademark Office (USPTO), a federal agency established by the Patent Act. A U.S. patent lasts from\nthe date of issuance until 20 years after the date on which the application for the patent was filed with\nthe USPTO. Patent Act remedies available to the holder of an infringed U.S. patent include damages,\nrecovery of lost profits and recovery of legal fees.\n“Inventions and discoveries” eligible for a patent under the Patent Act generally include any\nmachine, manufacture, composition of matter, process, art or method, or any improvement thereto\nthat is novel, useful and non-obvious. Newly developed plants, plant varieties, seeds, plant parts, plant\ngenes or plant production processes are generally recognized as inventions or discoveries eligible for a\nU.S. patent if they satisfy certain criteria. The Patent Act also provides specifically for a “plant patent”\nthat precludes others from asexually reproducing, selling or using a distinct and new variety of plant\n(other than a tuber) that has been invented or discovered and asexually reproduced.\nThe Patent Act does not expressly prohibit the issuance of U.S. patents for inventions or discoveries\nthat are unlawful or designed to serve an unlawful purpose, and the USPTO has issued a range of\ncannabis-related patents. Cannabis-related inventions or discoveries for which the USPTO has issued\na patent include a cannabis strain named “Ecuadorean Sativa” (U.S. Plant Patent 27,475), cannabis\ncultivation and processing methods (U.S. Patent 9,095,554), a vaporizer (U.S. Patent 9,220,294),\nTHC-infused shea butter for topical application (U.S. Patent 8,425,954), a THC extraction method\n(U.S. Patent 6,365,416) and equipment and methods for biosynthetic production of cannabinoids\n(U.S. Patent 9,587,212). U.K.-based GW Pharmaceuticals holds multiple cannabis-related U.S. patents.\nAnd despite the federal government’s position for purposes of the CSA that marijuana has no\ncurrently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, the U.S. federal government itself\nholds a patent for methods of treating certain diseases with cannabinoids (U.S. Patent 6,630,507).\nPlant Variety Protection Act\nThe Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) establishes certain legal protections (or “breeders’ rights”) for\nthe breeder of a sexually reproduced or tuber-propagated plant variety that is new, distinct, uniform\nand stable within the meaning of the PVPA. A breeder who so develops such a plant variety and satis-\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 83\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nfies other PVPA requirements may apply for and receive a certificate of plant variety protection issued\nby the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Such a certificate establishes a breeder’s right, for a\nperiod of time and subject to certain exceptions, to exclude others from selling the variety, offering it\nfor sale, reproducing it, importing or exporting it, or using it in producing a hybrid or different variety.\nA breeder’s rights under the certificate last for 20 years (25 years in the case of a protected tree or vine)\nfrom the certificate’s issue date.\nIt is not clear whether the USDA has issued any certificate of plant variety protection for a cannabis\nvariety. The USDA website provides a searchable database of certificates issued since February\n2013, as well as a schedule of crop categories for which certificates have been issued. A search of these\nUSDA materials indicated that no certificates for varieties of cannabis, marijuana or hemp have been\nissued. The PVPA defines “variety” as “a plant grouping within a single botanical taxon of the lowest\nknown rank” with certain defining and distinguishing features. Given the disagreement among botanists\nregarding cannabis taxonomy noted in Chapter II, Cannabis Science 101, it may be challenging\nto demonstrate that a cannabis variety satisfies PVPA criteria for protection.\nTrademark Act\nA trademark is a word, name, symbol or device used by a person to identify and distinguish the person’s\ngoods or services from the goods and services of others and to indicate the source of the goods or services.\nTrademarks take many forms, including logos, slogans, symbols, colors and sounds. Under common\nlaw and through registration under state and federal statutes, a trademark owner can be afforded\ncertain legal protections against unauthorized use of the trademark by others.\nTrademark protection under federal law is provided primarily by the Trademark Act, also known\nas the Lanham Act, which provides for registration of trademarks with the USPTO. The holder of a\nfederally registered trademark receives certain rights and protections under federal law, including the\nright to use the “®” symbol, evidence and nationwide notice of a claim of ownership, access to federal\ncourts for dispute resolution, the ability to prevent importation of foreign goods that infringe on the\ntrademark, and the right to recover certain statutory damages and attorneys’ fees. Generally, federal\nregistration is the most comprehensive trademark protection available in the United States.\nFederal trademark registration requires “lawful” use of the trademark in commerce. Thus, trademarks\nused to identify, distinguish or indicate the source of cannabis or related products or services\nthat are illegal under federal law are not eligible for federal registration. However, federal registration is\navailable for trademarks used in connection with federally legal cannabis-related products or services,\nsuch as a recipe for food intended to be infused with cannabis or a cannabis-related clothing line.\nAlternatives to federal trademark registration include protections available under common law and\nthrough registration under state trademark statutes. Common law protections vary across jurisdictions\nand generally extend only to geographical regions where a trademark has first been used in commerce.\nState trademark registration generally provides protection within the entire state but, like federal registration,\nmay not be available for trademarks used in connection with unlawful subject matter.\n84 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nn The Path to Federal Legalization\nWe believe that cannabis will eventually become federally legal for recreational enjoyment by adults\nand for use in a broad range of safe drugs and therapeutic products. A wide gulf currently separates\nfederal policy from state legalization initiatives. Both federal and state regulators lack experience with\nscience-based regulation that allows cannabis access, but they approach this lack of experience differently.\nCurrent federal policy is slow-turning and bureaucratic; it requires rigorous scientific evidence\nthat cannabis is safe and effective but largely prohibits the industry from developing that evidence.\nState legalization initiatives are experimental: they start by legalizing the cannabis industry, then task\nstate regulators with implementing rules and safeguards as the industry builds its scientific foundation\nand its markets.\nWe believe that federal policy will move (and may already be moving) in a new direction which\nallows for federally approved cannabis-derived drugs. If that happens, and if several cannabis-derived\ndrugs are federally approved, we expect the FDA and the DEA will have developed data and protocols\nthat facilitate more rapid approval of medical cannabis products. And if that happens, these federal\nagencies should be able to combine their science-based regulatory practices with the best practices of\nstate regulators to develop a comprehensive federal approach to medical and recreational cannabis.\nDEA and FDA Policy Direction\nThe path to federal legalization begins with understanding that current federal law, in theory, allows for\nthe production, distribution and prescription of medical cannabis products in the United States. The\nDEA can register manufacturers to produce medical cannabis products in accordance with the CSA.\nThe FDA can approve medical cannabis products for distribution in accordance with the FD&C Act.\nThe DEA (an agency of the DOJ) and the FDA (an agency of the DHHS) together can cause medical\ncannabis products to be rescheduled under the CSA so that doctors legally can prescribe them. None\nof these regulatory actions requires a change in law. Technically, cannabis is not entirely prohibited by\nfederal law.\nBut in any practical sense, cannabis is federally prohibited. For nearly 50 years, the DEA has registered\nonly one cannabis manufacturer. The FDA has never approved a cannabis-derived drug. Because\nmarijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance, the lone DEA-registered cannabis manufacturer\ncan produce cannabis only for strictly controlled research, and doctors cannot prescribe any marijuana\ncompound or derivative as medicine. A duo of federal regulatory agencies—not federal law—prohibits\nlawful access to medical cannabis products; this may be changing. The DEA and the FDA appear to be\nexploring policies and practices that could result in the actual production, distribution and prescription\nof cannabis-derived drugs.\nIn August 2016, the DEA announced a new policy designed to increase (beyond one) the number\nof DEA-registered cannabis cultivators and permit-registered cultivators to grow cannabis for privately\nfunded commercial drug development projects. The DEA has since accepted at least 25 applications for\nregistration but has not issued any new registrations. Some observers believe the new policy initiative\nhas stalled under the leadership of the DOJ, currently run by U.S. Attorney General Sessions. How-\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 85\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\never, that the DEA recognized and responded to the demand for expanded registration is a significant\ndevelopment on its own, and one that we believe may signal an important redirection of DEA policy.\nIn October 2017, the FDA accepted GW Pharmaceuticals’ New Drug Application (NDA) for the\ncannabis-derived drug Epidiolex. The steps required to file an NDA for any drug involve extensive\ncoordination and data sharing between the FDA and the applicant; submission of the Epidiolex NDA\nis an important milestone toward FDA approval. Many observers expect that Epidiolex will be the first\ncannabis-derived drug approved by the FDA.\nAdditionally, the FDA published industry guidance on botanical drug development in December\n2016, several months after the DEA announced its new registration policy. The FDA guidance discusses\nchallenges inherent to botanical drugs, including challenges related to ensuring therapeutic consistency,\nand suggests certain steps to address those challenges. The FDA guidance updates and replaces\nsimilar guidance last issued in June 2004, and we believe that the timing of this update may relate to\nother cannabis-related developments at the FDA and the DEA.\nFederal Legalization: Predicted Developments\nWe predict six developments on the path to federal legalization: (1) the FDA will begin approving individual\npharmaceutical-grade drugs derived from cannabis; (2) more states will adopt medical cannabis\nlaws; (3) more states will adopt recreational laws; (4) the FDA will adopt routine approval procedures\nfor drugs with extracts of low-THC/high-CBD cannabis varieties; (5) the FDA will adopt routine\napproval procedures for drugs with extracts of high-THC cannabis varieties; and (6) cannabis parts\nand derivatives will be removed from the CSA schedules (either incrementally, starting with CBD, or\nall at once) and will be fully legal for medical and\nPath to Federal Legalization recreational purposes.\n1. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will\nbegin approving individual pharmaceuticalgrade\ndrugs derived from cannabis.\n2. More states will adopt medical cannabis\nlaws.\n3. More states will adopt recreational laws.\n4. The FDA will adopt routine approval\nprocedures for drugs with extracts of\nlow-THC/high-CBD cannabis varieties.\n5. The FDA will adopt routine approval\nprocedures for drugs with extracts of\nhigh-THC cannabis varieties.\n6. Cannabis parts and derivatives will be\nremoved from the CSA schedules and will\nbe fully legal for medical and recreational\npurposes.\nWe do not predict that these developments\nnecessarily will occur in the order presented. We\ndo expect some of them to develop in parallel, and\nnone of them depends fundamentally on any other.\nThe manner in which federal cannabis legalization\nactually proceeds, and the timing of any related\ndevelopments, are not known to us or anyone else.\nAlmost certainly, our predictions will prove inaccurate\nin some respects. States may reverse their legalization\nefforts. The medical efficacy of cannabis\nmay not be proved to be significant. Cannabis may\nnever be legalized federally. However, we believe\nthese developments will likely be among others\nthat lead to the federal legalization of cannabis. We\nexpand on each of these developments in the following\ndiscussion.\n86 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\n(1) FDA Approves Cannabis-Derived Pharmaceuticals\nThe FDA will approve pharmaceutical-grade drugs derived from cannabis through the NDA process.\nFDA approval will require manufacturers to use cannabis varieties with particular chemical profiles and\nto demonstrate the ability to control the chemical consistency of those varieties during manufacturing.\nThe DEA will place a narrow characterization of each FDA-approved drug on CSA Schedule II, III, IV\nor V, and will issue one or more registrations to manufacture the drug and the cannabis variety used to\nproduce the drug. The FDA will improve and refine its botanical-drug review process in general and,\nin particular, as it relates to cannabis-derived drugs. The FDA, the DEA and DEA-registered cannabis\nresearchers and manufacturers will cooperate to create a federal database of (i) each cannabis variety\napproved for use in producing an FDA-approved drug and (ii) the manufacturing controls required by\nthe DEA and the FDA to cultivate chemically consistent plants of the variety in accordance with the\nCSA and the FDA’s drug approval. We refer to each cannabis variety in this database, together with\nits required manufacturing controls, as an “FDA-registered chemovar” (a chemovar is a plant variety\ncharacterized by its chemical content).\n(2) More States Adopt Medical Cannabis Laws\nMore states will adopt medical cannabis laws, and the number and nature of qualifying medical conditions\nincluded in such laws will expand. Scientific research will improve the ability of the state-legal\nmedical cannabis industry to develop products that target specific medical conditions. Companies will\nincreasingly seek to differentiate such medical product offerings from recreational cannabis products.\nState regulators and industry leaders will seek to standardize testing, labeling and quality control procedures\nparticular to medical cannabis products and adopt cannabis-variety recognition and manufacturing\npractices consistent with those for FDA-registered chemovars.\n(3) More States Adopt Recreational Laws\nMore states will adopt recreational laws, typically after medical cannabis has been legalized for some\nperiod of time. States will establish agencies to comprehensively regulate both recreational and medical\ncannabis; some regulatory standards will apply across both categories but, increasingly, regulations will\ndevelop specific to each category. State regulators will learn from the recreational cannabis experience\nof other states and will seek to standardize regulations that allow adults to responsibly enjoy cannabis\nwhile protecting the health and safety of the general public. Recreational cannabis regulations will\nresemble federal and state alcohol and tobacco regulations, addressing issues such as product potency\nand warning labels, and restrictions on advertising and packaging that appeal to minors.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 87\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\n(4) FDA Routinely Approves CBD Drugs\nThe FDA will adopt procedures for the routine approval of drugs that contain extracts of certain\nlow-THC/high-CBD FDA-registered chemovars. The new procedures will involve development of\na low-THC cannabis drug monograph that resembles in some ways the FDA monographs for overthe-counter\ndrugs. The monograph will address formulation, dosing and labeling requirements. The\nFDA-registered chemovars included in the monograph will be rescheduled by the DEA to Schedule II,\nIII, IV or V in order to relax DEA registration requirements for manufacturing; however, the chemovars\nthemselves (particularly their flowers) will not be approved for use by the FDA, and only drugs\nproduced from extracts in accordance with the monograph will receive routine FDA approval.\n(5) FDA Routinely Approves THC Drugs\nRelying on experience with the low-THC cannabis drug monograph and a growing database of FDAregistered\nchemovars, the FDA will adopt procedures for the routine approval of drugs that contain\nextracts of certain high-THC FDA-registered chemovars. The procedures will parallel in many ways\nthose used in the low-THC monograph procedure, and likely will incorporate additional safeguards\nrelated to THC content. The FDA-registered chemovars included in the high-THC monograph will be\nrescheduled by the DEA, but cannabis flower from those rescheduled chemovars will not be approved\nfor use by the FDA.\n(6) Federal Government Legalizes Cannabis\nParts and derivatives of the cannabis plant will be removed from the CSA schedules. This could occur\nincrementally, starting with CBD (which could be removed by amending the definition of marijuana\nto exclude CBD) and followed later by the rest of the plant (including THC). Or all parts and derivatives\nof the plant could be de-scheduled at the same time. There will be three general categories of\nlegal cannabis products: (i) FDA-approved drugs, which will continue to be developed and approved\nthrough the NDA and other processes; (ii) “therapeutic” cannabis products, which may be limited\nto CBD concentrates and infused products if CBD is de-scheduled first, but which eventually will\ninclude smokable flower (including high-THC flower) and most forms of cannabis, and which will\nbe permitted to make limited health-related claims but will not be approved by the FDA as safe and\neffective for treating any specified medical condition; and (iii) recreational products, which also may\nbe limited to CBD products initially, but which eventually will include a broad range of high-THC\nflower, concentrates and infused products. The DEA will still require registration of cannabis and CBD\nmanufacturers if CBD is de-scheduled first, but once the entire cannabis plant is de-scheduled, a new\nfederal cannabis agency will be established to regulate medical and recreational cannabis in cooperation\nwith the FDA and state regulators. The new agency will adopt the DEA’s institutional framework\nfor controlling the manufacture of chemovars used in FDA-approved drugs and the most successful\nstate strategies for regulating recreational cannabis, such as potency limits, labeling requirements and\nrestrictions on marketing to minors.\n88 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IV\nU.S. Legal Landscape\nOutlook\nDevelopment (1) does not require any change in federal law or radical departure from prior federal\npolicy, but merely requires a redirection of FDA and DEA policies and practices. Developments (2)\nand (3) also do not require a fundamental change in federal law. In this sense, developments (1)–(3)\nlargely reflect incremental developments within the existing legal environment. For example, eight\nstate legislatures are expected in 2018 to introduce ballot measures or explore regulatory frameworks\nfor recreational cannabis (Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island and\nVermont). Three other states (Missouri, Oklahoma and Wyoming) are expected to enact medical cannabis\nlaws in 2018. And as discussed previously, many observers expect that in 2018, the FDA will\napprove a cannabis-derived pharmaceutical for the first time.\nDevelopments (4)–(6) require more fundamental changes in federal laws and policies. We do not\nexpect developments (4), (5) or (6) to occur during the current presidential term, but we believe that\nthere is a reasonable chance development (4) could begin within the next five years and development\n(5) could occur within two years thereafter. In total, we believe it could take up to 10 years or more\nbefore the federal legalization process reaches development (6) and cannabis becomes fully legal under\nfederal law.\nWe believe that cannabis will become federally legal when American voters demand it. Developments\n(1)–(5) are not required precursors to federal legalization, and either the U.S. Congress or the\nDEA could initiate development (6) at any time. We believe that either the Congress or the DEA is\nmore likely to take such a step in an environment where developments (1)–(5) have progressed, but\nthere are signs that pressure from American voters may be mounting for the federal government to act\nmore quickly.\nAccording to Gallup, the percentage of Americans who support legalization of cannabis use has\nincreased significantly over the past two decades, and 64% of Americans today believe cannabis use\nshould be legal. We expect that, eventually, federal policy will align with the attitudes of a majority\nof American voters. The following graph shows the percentage of Americans who answered “Yes” to\nGallup when asked whether use of marijuana should be made legal.\nU.S. Public Support for Legalizing Cannabis Use\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n1996 2000 2001 2003 2005 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\nSource: Gallup.

This momentum is driven primarily by the increasing recognition\nthat cannabis may have a range of legitimate medicinal benefits and therapeutic applications.\nAt least 20 countries now have medical laws that facilitate patient access to cannabis or concentrates\nfor treating specified medical conditions. Notable countries with such medical laws include Australia,\nCanada, Colombia and Germany; countries without such laws include China, Japan, Russia and the\nUnited States. (Contrary to U.S. federal law, 29 states, encompassing 62% of the U.S. population,\npermit the production and possession of cannabis or concentrates for use in treating a broad range of\nqualifying medical conditions.) While the merits of medical cannabis are currently driving legalization,\nwe believe that—like Uruguay and numerous U.S. states—other countries will ultimately enact legislation\npermitting the production, sale and use of recreational cannabis. (Canada is widely expected to\ndo so in mid-2018.)\nThe following world map illustrates select countries that (i) have enacted medical laws that facilitate\npatient access to cannabis or concentrates for treating specified medical conditions, (ii) have enacted\nrecreational laws that permit the commercial production and sale of cannabis to adults for recreational\nand other uses, or (iii) include a state or province that has a cannabis law or policy in conflict with\nfederal law.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 91\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nSelect Countries with Legalized Cannabis Access (January 2018)\nMedical Law\nArgentina\nAustralia\nBrazil\nChile\nColombia\nCroatia\nCzech Republic\nGermany\nGreece\nIsrael\nItaly\nJamaica\nLesotho\nMacedonia\nMexico\nNetherlands\nPeru\nPoland\nSwitzerland\nTurkey\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC\nRecreational Law\nCanada 1\nUruguay 2\nState/Province Conflict with Federal Law\nIndia\nSpain\nUnited States\n1\nCanada currently has a medical law.

Canadian companies are cultivating cannabis in South America and supplying\nmarkets in Europe, Australian companies are forming research partnerships with producers in\nIsrael, and European companies are securing cannabis-related patents in the United States. And, as\ndiscussed in more detail in Chapter VII, Capital Markets for Cannabis Companies, more cross-border\ninvestment activity is taking place as industry participants position for the expected further opening of\nglobal cannabis markets.\nDespite the growing recognition of the potential medical value of cannabis, the current legalization\nmomentum and the increasingly international scope of cannabis business, the movement of products\nand flow of capital required for a truly global industry continue to be inhibited by incongruous laws,\nregulations and international treaties. For example, concerns about violating U.S. federal banking and\nanti–money laundering regulations have caused certain U.S. banks to refuse to be connected to the\ncannabis industry, avoiding even indirect association with cannabis activity that is legal where conducted.\nIn one instance, a number of U.S. banks threatened to cease business with certain Uruguayan\nbanks that serviced pharmacies legally distributing recreational cannabis within Uruguay. In turn, those\nUruguayan banks effectively forced the pharmacies to stop participating in Uruguay’s cannabis market.\n(In a similar way, lack of access to the U.S. federal banking system continues to inhibit growth of the\ndomestic cannabis industry.) Until the largest economies in the world more fully embrace cannabis, we\nmust stop short of calling cannabis a truly global industry. However, we believe that the legalization\nmomentum will continue worldwide.\nn United Nations Conventions\nInternational regulation of cannabis, cannabis derivatives and many other narcotic, psychotropic and\nsimilar substances is addressed primarily by three international treaties (Conventions) adopted through\nthe United Nations (UN) between 1961 and 1988.\nThe Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 (1961 Convention) addresses regulation of\nthe cannabis plant, the coca flower and the opium poppy; certain of their derivatives (such as hashish,\ncocaine and heroin, respectively); and any other substance found in accordance with the 1961\nConvention to be “liable to similar abuse and productive of similar ill effects.” The 1961 Convention\nestablishes four schedules of substances subject to increasingly strict controls in the following order:\nSchedule III, Schedule II, Schedule I and Schedule IV. Schedule IV substances (the most strictly controlled)\nare those Schedule I substances found to be particularly liable to abuse and to produce ill effects\nand for which such liability is not offset by substantial therapeutic advantages. Cannabis, cannabis\nresin, and extracts and tinctures of cannabis are included on Schedule I; cannabis and cannabis resin\nare also included on Schedule IV.\nThe Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 (1971 Convention) addresses regulation of\ncertain “psychotropic” substances, which the Convention recognizes generally as substances that may\nstimulate or depress the central nervous system causing “hallucinations or disturbances in motor func-\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 93\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\ntion or thinking or behaviour [sic] or perception or mood,” that may produce “a state of dependence”\nand that are subject to abuse “so as to constitute a public health and social problem warranting the\nplacing of the substance under international control.” Substances addressed by the 1971 Convention\ninclude THC, barbiturates, amphetamines and psychedelics such as LSD. The 1971 Convention\nestablishes four schedules of substances subject to increasingly strict controls in the following\norder: Schedule IV, Schedule III, Schedule II and Schedule I. Schedule I includes THC and certain\nof its isomers and stereochemical variants. Schedule II includes dronabinol (a synthetic THC) and its\nstereochemical variants.\nThe United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\nof 1988 (Traffic Convention) establishes additional tools for enforcing provisions of the 1961\nand 1971 Conventions. The Traffic Convention provides for international cooperation in arresting\nand prosecuting illicit traffickers of substances scheduled under the 1961 and 1971 Conventions and\nin disrupting their financial and distribution networks through extradition, anti–money laundering\npractices, asset forfeiture and other methods.\nGenerally, the Conventions contemplate that the manufacture, export, import, distribution, use and\npossession of scheduled substances should be allowed only for medical and scientific purposes under\nlegal authority and that penalties, including criminal penalties, should apply to those who engage in\nsuch activities for other purposes or outside legal authority. Countries participating in the Conventions\nare generally required to enact laws and regulations that carry out the provisions of the Conventions,\nwhich may require them to establish dedicated regulatory agencies, track and report physical inventories\nas well as production and revenue data, implement and enforce labeling requirements and quality\ncontrol procedures, restrict use of substances to those holding medical prescriptions and impose criminal\npenalties for violations. Currently, more than 180 countries are party to each Convention.\nAmending schedules under the 1961 and 1971 Conventions generally involves participation of\nthree UN-related bodies: (1) the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), one of the six main organs\nof the UN established under the UN charter in 1945; (2) the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND),\nitself a subsidiary body of the ECOSOC that assists the ECOSOC in supervising the application of\ninternational drug control treaties; and (3) the World Health Organization (WHO), an autonomous\nintergovernmental organization that collaborates with the UN and other organizations on global health\nmatters. A schedule amendment may be initiated by the WHO or by any country participating in the\napplicable Convention, and generally requires approval of the CND, which approval may be subject\nto further review and approval by the ECOSOC. Notably, because regulations applicable to cannabis\nand certain derivatives are included in the body of the 1961 Convention (and not just in its schedules),\nmerely removing cannabis and its derivatives from the schedules under the 1961 Convention would\nnot entirely remove cannabis from that Convention’s regulatory framework.\nRecent Developments Related to the UN Conventions\nGlobal support for the prohibitionist policies of the Conventions is waning, and a growing chorus of\nworld leaders is calling for new policies for cannabis and other substances to be based on public health\nconcerns rather than criminalization.\n94 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER V\nGlobal Cannabis Regulation\nIn 2012, the presidents of Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico requested the UN to focus its next\nspecial session on drugs on policy reform rather than on a mere progress review and continuation\nof the same policies. In 2014, the Global Commission on Drug Policy—represented by former UN\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and the former presidents of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Poland,\nPortugal and Switzerland—called for an end to the criminalization of drug use and possession and for\nthe responsible legal regulation of psychoactive substances.\nA UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on drugs was originally scheduled for 2019,\nbut was accelerated to April 2016 as a result of a proposal sponsored by Mexico and cosponsored by\n95 other countries. The general assembly is the primary policy body of the United Nations, and one\nin which all UN member states have equal representation. Given this broad representation and the\ngrowing support for decriminalization, many expected the 2016 UNGASS on drugs to result in significant\nchanges in policy. In an open letter delivered to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the eve\nof the session, former presidents or prime ministers of Brazil, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Greece,\nHungary, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland and Switzerland joined with high-profile scholars,\ncelebrities, clergy, business leaders, elected officials and others in pressing the Secretary-General to call\nfor reform of prohibitionist drug control policies. Those supporting reform were disappointed when\nthe UN General Assembly adopted a resolution reaffirming its “commitment to the goals and objectives”\nof the three Conventions.\nDespite the lack of an immediate and fundamental shift away from the prohibitionist policies of\nthe Conventions, other steps are being taken that may result in relaxed cannabis controls within the\nexisting Conventions framework. A committee of the WHO tasked with making drug control recommendations\nto the CND on behalf of the WHO—the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence\n(ECDD)—recognized an increase in medical cannabis use and the emergence of cannabis-related pharmaceuticals,\nand in November 2016 requested that the WHO prepare “pre-review” materials for cannabis,\nfor the specific cannabis derivatives scheduled under the 1961 and 1971 Conventions, and for\ncannabidiol, or CBD. These pre-review materials are preliminary analyses considered by the ECDD to\ndetermine if more in-depth “critical reviews” should be undertaken by the ECDD.\nThe WHO presented the requested CBD pre-review materials at a November 2017 ECDD meeting.\nThe CBD materials indicate that CBD exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or dependence\npotential in humans, and that there is no evidence of any public health–related problems associated\nwith the use of pure CBD. The outstanding pre-reviews related to cannabis and specific derivatives\nare expected in early 2018. The ECDD recommended that the pre-review materials be evaluated at\na specific cannabis-focused ECDD meeting to be held no later than June 2018. The requested prereviews\nrepresent the first ever scientific guidance on cannabis to be issued within the framework of\nthe Conventions. If the pre-reviews lead to critical reviews, such reviews could ultimately result in a\nWHO-initiated rescheduling of substances under the 1961 and 1971 Conventions.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 95\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nn Global Legal Developments\nNations around the world have recently passed or are considering enacting an array of measures decriminalizing\ncannabis, legalizing it for medical use or, in a few cases, legalizing it for recreational use in contravention\nof the UN Conventions. The following discussion summarizes recent legal developments\nrelated to cannabis across different regions.\nUnited States\nDespite marijuana and THC being Schedule I controlled substances under the CSA—which, practically\nspeaking, makes almost all manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of cannabis in\nthe United States a federal crime—29 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have enacted medical\ncannabis laws that permit the production and possession of cannabis or concentrates for use in treating\na broad range of qualifying medical conditions, and 8 of those same states have enacted recreational\nlaws that permit the commercial production and sale of cannabis to adults for recreational and other\nuses. And 19 U.S. states (including 2 with medical cannabis laws) have passed narrow CBD/limited\nlaws that permit possession of small amounts of low-THC/high-CBD cannabis concentrates for use in\ntreating a few serious medical conditions—in particular, severe forms of childhood epilepsy. A majority\nof Americans now live in states that permit the production and possession of cannabis or concentrates\nfor use in treating a broad range of qualifying medical conditions, and polls show that a majority\nof Americans believe cannabis use should be legal. For a more thorough discussion of U.S. state and\nfederal law, see Chapter IV, U.S. Legal Landscape.\nCanada\nCanada’s Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) was enacted in 1996 and currently serves\nas the country’s implementing legislation under the UN Conventions. The CDSA establishes eight\nschedules of “controlled substances” and imposes civil and criminal penalties for production, trafficking,\nimporting, exporting and possession of those controlled substances in violation of the CDSA.\nCannabis, cannabis preparations and derivatives, and certain cannabinoids, including THC and CBD,\nare Schedule II substances under the CDSA. Those who commit CDSA violations related to Schedule\nII substances are subject to fines and imprisonment.\nIn a 2000 decision by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the court held that certain criminal prohibitions\nunder the CDSA related to cannabis were unconstitutional because they did not include a constitutionally\nacceptable medical exemption. Following this constitutional holding and acting within\nthe framework of the CDSA, which allows for the issuance of regulations and exemptions thereunder,\nCanada issued a sequence of three medical marijuana regulations discussed below.\nThe Marihuana [sic] Medical Access Regulations (MMAR), issued in 2001, permitted individuals\nwith the authorization of their health care practitioners to grow their own cannabis plants for medical\npurposes, to designate someone to grow cannabis for them or to purchase dry cannabis flower from\nHealth Canada (the government agency charged with administering Canada’s medical cannabis regulations).\nThe MMAR was successfully challenged on constitutional grounds and eventually replaced\n96 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER V\nGlobal Cannabis Regulation\nin 2013 by the Marihuana [sic] Medical Program Regulations (MMPR). The MMPR created a regulatory\nframework under which individuals with a medical need could obtain dry cannabis flower from\nlicensed commercial producers. Like the MMAR before it, the MMPR was held unconstitutional and\nwas eventually replaced, this time in August 2016, by the currently effective Access to Cannabis for\nMedical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR).\nThe ACMPR permits businesses licensed by Health Canada to commercially produce and distribute\ncannabis flower, cannabis oil and cannabis starter materials, such as plants and seeds, to individuals\nwith a medical recommendation from an authorized health care practitioner. The ACMPR also allows\nsuch individuals to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes, or to designate\nanother person (which may include Health Canada) to produce it for them. The ACMPR sets\nforth a comprehensive licensing and regulatory regime that addresses security of licensed production\nfacilities, import and export permits, quality control measures and labeling requirements, and imposes\nlimits on the amount of cannabis that can be produced and possessed by an individual.\nIn April 2017, a proposed recreational law was introduced in the Canadian parliament; this legislation\nwould allow adults to purchase cannabis from federally licensed producers and to possess and\nshare cannabis with other adults. The proposed Cannabis Act would authorize the Canadian government\nto issue regulations for the administration and enforcement of the act and to issue licenses and\npermits authorizing the importation, exportation, production, testing, packaging, labeling, sending,\ndelivery, transportation, sale, possession or disposal of cannabis and cannabis products. The Cannabis\nAct would authorize Canadian provinces and territories to regulate the distribution and retail sale of\ncannabis within their jurisdictions, and all individuals and entities, including federally licensed businesses,\nwould be required to comply with those local regulations as well as federal laws.\nUnlike the ACMPR, which is a set of medical cannabis regulations issued within the framework of\nCanada’s CDSA, the Cannabis Act would amend the CDSA and related criminal and other statutes to\nfacilitate the recreational law in Canada. The proposed Cannabis Act is widely expected to be approved\nin some form by the Canadian parliament by mid-2018. If approved, Canada would be the largest\ncountry in the world to legalize recreational cannabis on a national level.\nLatin America and the Caribbean\nDuring the past five years, Latin American and Caribbean nations (and Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory)\nhave taken significant legal measures that increase access to cannabis for medical purposes, permit\nrecreational cannabis use and relax criminal prohibitions.\nIn 2013, Uruguay became the first nation in the world to legalize and regulate the commercial production\nand sale of cannabis to adults for recreational and other uses. The Uruguayan law authorizes\nlicensed producers to grow cannabis for sale, through licensed pharmacies, to Uruguayan citizens and\npermanent residents who have registered with the government; the law also permits individuals to\ngrow up to six cannabis plants per year and to form small clubs that may grow up to 99 plants per year.\nCannabis sales through licensed pharmacies commenced in 2017.\nIn 2015, Colombia approved a legal framework for the cultivation, processing and sale of cannabis\nextracts and related products for scientific and medical purposes. The Colombian framework provides\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 97\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nfor the issuance of separate licenses for cultivation and processing. It also contemplates that permits will\nbe available under Colombia’s export laws for the export of lawful cannabis products to jurisdictions\nwhere importation is legal. Colombia issued the first processing license in 2016 and the first cultivation\nlicense in 2017.\nIn 2017, Argentina enacted regulations permitting the use of cannabis oil and other derivatives\neither by qualifying patients or for scientific and medical research. Under the new legislation, the government\nwill oversee cultivation and production of cannabis and its derivatives for research purposes\nand for patient consumption, establish a national registry of qualifying patients and make cannabis\nproducts available to those patients, free of charge. The government expects to import cannabis supplies\nuntil they can be produced domestically.\nOther Latin American nations that have taken recent steps to increase medical cannabis access\ninclude Chile, Brazil, Mexico and Peru. In 2015, Chile changed its laws to allow medical cannabis use\nby patients and to authorize the sale of cannabis-based medicines through pharmacies. In 2016, Brazil\napproved a resolution authorizing the prescription and importation of cannabis products, including\nTHC and CBD, for use in treating certain qualifying medical conditions. In June 2017, Mexico\nenacted a law directing its Ministry of Health to prepare regulations for the research, production and\nmedicinal use of “pharmacological derivatives” of cannabis. In November 2017, Peru adopted a bill\nlegalizing the production, commercialization and importation of cannabis oil to be used for medical\npurposes.\nIn the Caribbean region, Puerto Rico, the Cayman Islands and Jamaica have taken measures to\ndecriminalize cannabis or increase access for medical use. In 2015, the governor of Puerto Rico signed\nan executive order that legalized use of cannabis derivatives (but not cannabis flower) for medical\npurposes. Jamaica passed a law in 2015 that decriminalizes possession of small amounts of cannabis,\npermits an individual to cultivate no more than five cannabis plants, establishes a medical cannabis\nregulatory agency and allows tourists with foreign medical cannabis prescriptions to purchase small\namounts of cannabis. A 2016 law enacted in the Cayman Islands legalized the use of cannabis extracts\nfor medical purposes and authorized the creation of import regulations and the sale through licensed\npharmacies.\nAustralia and New Zealand\nAustralia amended its Narcotic Drugs Act in 2016 to authorize a regulated medical cannabis industry\nin the country. The amendment establishes licenses to cultivate cannabis, produce cannabis resin and\nother products for medicinal purposes, manufacture medicinal cannabis products and conduct cannabis\nresearch. A license-holder is required to secure a permit that places conditions on the license and\nidentifies specific activities allowed within the scope of the license. Cannabis products for medicinal\nuse that are either legally manufactured in Australia or legally imported can be prescribed to qualifying\nmedical patients. The amendment defines medicinal cannabis products broadly as a product that\nincludes, or is produced from, any part of the cannabis plant and is intended for the purpose of “curing,\nor alleviating the symptoms of a disease, ailment or injury.”\n98 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER V\nGlobal Cannabis Regulation\nNew Zealand’s Misuse of Drugs Act generally makes the importation, cultivation, distribution, possession\nand use of cannabis illegal. However, in September 2017, New Zealand’s Health Ministry lifted\ncertain restrictions so that doctors may now prescribe approved CBD products. (Previously, patients\nin need of CBD products were required to apply directly to the Health Ministry, and approval was\ngranted on a case-by-case basis.) In December 2017, New Zealand introduced legislation for a medical\nlaw that would amend the Misuse of Drugs Act to permit domestic production of medical cannabis\nproducts and their use by people with terminal illness or chronic pain.\nEurope\nThe European Union provides no coordinated legal framework for cannabis and, historically, European\ncountries generally have prohibited its production and sale, but have also decriminalized or tolerated\npossession of small amounts.\nIn some European countries, personal use exceptions to criminal prosecution have been used to\ncarve out visible distribution models. In the Netherlands, for example, Amsterdam is famous for its\ncoffee-shop cannabis sales, even though the suppliers of cannabis to those coffee shops generally operate\nillegally. And in Spain, despite a federal prohibition on the sale of cannabis, court decisions and\nlaws permitting cultivation for personal consumption have served to justify the country’s hundreds of\nprivate cannabis clubs.\nTo date, no European country has implemented a recreational law comparable to those in Uruguay\nand some U.S. states and expected in Canada. However, starting with the Netherlands in 2003, a\nnumber of European countries have enacted medical laws that facilitate patient access to cannabis or\nconcentrates, through importation or domestic production, for treating specified medical conditions.\nItaly has allowed medical cannabis use since 2013 under a law that requires cannabis to be sold\nthrough authorized pharmacies to patients with a valid prescription.\nCroatia legalized the limited use of medical cannabis products in 2015. Under the law, doctors may\nprescribe cannabis ointments, teas and other extracts to patients with a qualifying health condition,\nincluding tumors, AIDS, multiple sclerosis and child epilepsy. Smoking or vaporizing cannabis flower\nis not allowed under the law. In 2016, Croatia received a shipment of medical cannabis products from\na Canadian producer, marking the first time a North American company legally shipped cannabis\nproducts containing THC and CBD into the European Union.\nA German law that took effect in 2017 legalizes the use of medical cannabis products prescribed for\npatients with serious illnesses, including multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, epilepsy and chemotherapyinduced\nnausea and lack of appetite. The law provides a framework for the regulation of suppliers\nunder which the government has already issued import licenses to Canadian and Dutch firms and is\nfinalizing an approval process for the issuance of domestic production licenses.\nA 2017 Polish law permits patients to obtain medical cannabis products, including flower, extracts\nand tinctures, through pharmacies if they have both a physician’s medical authorization and permission\nfrom a regional pharmaceutical inspector. The qualifying conditions eligible for medical cannabis\ninclude chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea, multiple sclerosis, spasticity and treatmentresistant\nepilepsy. Cannabis products must be imported into Poland because the law does not permit\ncannabis cultivation within the country.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 99\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nGreece announced in 2017 that the use of cannabis extracts would be permitted for patients who\nobtain a doctor’s recommendation and are diagnosed with chronic pain, neuropathic pain, chemotherapy-induced\nnausea, certain eating disorders and cancer.\nIn the United Kingdom, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Drugs Act) generally prohibits the manufacture,\nsupply and possession of any “controlled drug,” including cannabis and cannabis resin, without\na license issued by the Home Office, a ministerial department of the U.K. government. There is\nno exception to this general Drugs Act prohibition that would facilitate patient access to cannabis or\nconcentrates for treating specified medical conditions. However, within the Drugs Act framework, the\nHome Office has issued to U.K.-based GW Pharmaceuticals licenses to cultivate, possess and supply\ncannabis for medical research and for commercial purposes. GW Pharmaceuticals produces Sativex,\na mouth spray that contains cannabis-derived THC and CBD and is used for treatment of spasticity\ncaused by multiple sclerosis. Sativex is generally recognized as the first prescription drug in the world\nto include plant-based cannabinoids. It was first approved for use in the U.K. in 2010 and has been\napproved for use in at least 30 countries (but not in the United States).\nMiddle East, Asia and Africa\nThroughout the Middle East, Asia and Africa, cannabis cultivation, sale and possession generally\nremain prohibited and punishable as criminal offenses. Only a handful of countries from these regions\nhave enacted laws that decriminalize possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use or facilitate\npatient access to cannabis or concentrates for treating specified medical conditions.\nIn 2017, particular sections of South Africa’s Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act, which prohibit cultivation,\npossession and personal use of cannabis on private property, were declared unconstitutional.\nDuring the same year, Lesotho (an enclave surrounded entirely by South Africa) granted a license to\na pharmaceutical company to grow, process and sell cannabis for medicinal use or scientific purposes.\nIn Israel, the country’s Dangerous Drug Ordinance generally criminalizes the manufacture, possession\nand use of cannabis. However, medical cannabis in smokable and other forms has been legal since\nthe 1990s for patients with a range of serious medical conditions, including multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s\ndisease, cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder, and the country is widely recognized as a global\nleader in medical cannabis research and cultivation. Under Israel’s medical cannabis rules, the Ministry\nof Health can issue permits for the production, distribution and use of medical cannabis products.\nPatients must first obtain a doctor’s recommendation and submit it to the ministry in order to receive a\nmedical cannabis use permit. In August 2017, the Israeli Ministries of Health and Finance announced\nthat licensed producers and distributors of medical cannabis would become eligible, for the first time,\nfor permits to export medical cannabis to jurisdictions where it is legal to import.\n100 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER V\nGlobal Cannabis Regulation\nn Global Outlook\nWhile the medical potential of cannabis is driving an initial wave of legalization, we believe countries\nwill eventually legalize the commercial production and sale of cannabis to adults for recreational use.\nIn this regard, 2018 will be an important year, with the expected approval of the recreational Cannabis\nAct in Canada and the implementation of California’s new recreational law. In Canada, we may observe\nfor the first time the implementation of a large-scale national recreational law. Similarly, as the most\npopulous U.S. state and one of the world’s largest economies, California’s recreational cannabis rollout\nwill be a bellwether for the global cannabis industry. The successes, failures and lessons learned in Canada\nand California will have significant impacts on the cannabis industry worldwide.\nIn our view, the course taken by the U.S. federal government will impact the global cannabis industry\nmore than any other factor. If the U.S. federal government were to change its current practice and\naggressively enforce existing federal cannabis laws, we would expect a corresponding dampening of\nthe industry worldwide. If the status quo were to continue in the United States, we would expect the\ncurrent global legalization trend to continue, particularly in Europe, South America and Africa. And\nif federal prohibition in the United States ends, we expect a surge in cannabis legalization worldwide.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 101\n\nCHAPTER VI\nU.S. and International\nCannabis Market Estimates\nn Global Market Overview\nCannabis is the most widely cultivated, produced, trafficked and consumed drug worldwide, according\nto the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2003, the UNODC estimated\nthat the global illegal cannabis market was $113 billion, with 160 million consumers. The UNODC\ncontinues to estimate the number of cannabis users worldwide and recently estimated that 183 million\npeople globally between the ages of 15 and 64, or more than 4% of this age group, consumed cannabis\nin 2015.\nIn 2010, the RAND Corporation (RAND) estimated that the U.S. illegal cannabis market was\n$40 billion. Adjusting this estimate solely for inflation and population growth, the U.S. illegal market\nwould now be approximately $48 billion.\nBoth the UNODC and RAND acknowledge the challenges inherent in studying an illegal consumer\nmarket, and both allow significant room for error in their estimates. However approximate,\ntheir estimates make clear that there is significant global demand for cannabis. Less clear is how quickly\nillegal markets will transition to legal markets, as well as the extent to which legalization may increase\noverall demand.\nThe Legal Cannabis Market: Key Growth Drivers\nWe believe that numerous factors will increase consumer penetration rates and the overall size of the\nlegal cannabis market. Such factors include the following.\nU.S. Federal Legalization. We believe it is a question of when, not if, cannabis becomes federally\nlegal. We predict six developments on the path to federal legalization: (1) the FDA will begin approving\nindividual pharmaceutical-grade drugs derived from cannabis; (2) more states will adopt medical\ncannabis laws; (3) more states will adopt recreational laws; (4) the FDA will adopt routine approval\nprocedures for drugs with extracts of low-THC/high-CBD cannabis varieties; (5) the FDA will adopt\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 103\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nroutine approval procedures for drugs with extracts of high-THC cannabis varieties; and (6) cannabis\nparts and derivatives will be removed from the CSA schedules (either incrementally, starting with\nCBD, or all at once) and will be fully legal for medical and recreational purposes. (We expand on these\npredicted developments in Chapter IV, U.S. Legal Landscape.) We believe that federal legalization will\ntrigger rapid growth in the U.S. market, propelled by interstate commerce, access to the federal banking\nsystem and acceleration of the cannabis-derived pharmaceuticals market. A change in the federal\nstatus of cannabis in the United States will not only drive U.S. market growth, but should provide a\nsignificant catalyst to the market worldwide.\nIncreasing Awareness of the Medical Efficacy of Cannabis. In aggregate, across all U.S. state laws,\ncannabis is legally recognized as a form of therapy or medicine for more than 50 medical conditions.\nIn addition, at least 20 countries have medical laws that facilitate patient access to cannabis or concentrates\nfor treating specified medical conditions. We believe that countries and U.S. states will continue\nto adopt and enhance legal frameworks for the medicinal use of cannabis products. In addition, we\nbelieve that many more cannabis consumers will emerge as research on cannabis increasingly demonstrates\nits medical efficacy and as more therapeutic products are developed and brought to market.\nIncreasing Recreational Legalization. Most laws facilitating access to cannabis, both in U.S. states\nand abroad, are medical laws. However, Uruguay and eight U.S. states have enacted recreational laws\npermitting the commercial production and sale of cannabis to adults for recreational and other uses\n(and Canada is widely expected to do so in mid-2018). In the handful of jurisdictions that started\nwith medical laws and later adopted recreational laws—particularly in Colorado, Washington and\nOregon—adoption of recreational laws has led to significant growth in overall market size and a rapid\nincrease in the percentage of the market represented by recreational consumers. We expect 2018 will be\na watershed year for the recreational market, with the implementation of California’s new recreational\nlaw and the expected approval and implementation of Canada’s recreational law. If these laws stimulate\ndemand, as expected, and are otherwise viewed as successful, we expect more U.S. states and additional\ncountries to follow suit with similar laws.\nBroadening Range of Cannabis Consumer Products. Product innovation and advancements in cannabis\nvarieties, concentrates, infused products, vaporizing technology and cannabis-derived pharmaceutical\nproducts will drive consumer adoption and spending. Cannabis consumer product companies\nwill seek to differentiate their products through marketing, distribution, packaging, selection, quality\nand pricing. We believe that product differentiation and availability will be more prevalent in legal\ncannabis markets and will drive consumer transition from illegal to legal markets.\nDeclining Prices in U.S. State-Legal Cannabis Markets. The supply of cannabis has increased considerably\nwith expanded state legalization in the United States. This increase has started to dampen\nretail and wholesale prices in various markets. As prices decline, we are starting to see closer price parity\nbetween state-legal and illegal markets (in the United States, cannabis is generally priced lower in\nillegal markets than in state-legal markets). Lower retail prices in state-legal markets should accelerate\nconsumer transition from illegal to state-legal markets and drive increased overall penetration rates.\nHowever, state and local taxes will continue to impact pricing for cannabis products in state-legal cannabis\nmarkets.\n104 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER VI\nU.S. and International Cannabis Market Estimates\nn U.S. State-Legal Cannabis Market\nMore than 97% of the U.S. population lives in a state or district (District of Columbia) with at least\none law that permits the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing or possession of cannabis or concentrates.\nAs described in more detail in Chapter IV, U.S. Legal Landscape, most of these laws are\nmedical laws, and only eight states have enacted recreational laws. While the overall state-legal market\nhas grown significantly, the addressable market has been constrained due to the lack of access to purely\nrecreational consumers and the sometimes-narrow scope of medical conditions that qualify a patient\nto access medical cannabis.\nWe estimate that the 2017 U.S. state-legal cannabis market was $8.0 billion, with more than four\nmillion consumers. The breakdown of this estimate by state is shown in the following chart.\n2017 U.S. State-Legal Cannabis 4 Market Estimate\nOther States\n$1.9 B\n$8.0B\nCalifornia\n$3.2 B\nColorado\n$1.5 B\nOregon\n$470 M\nWashington\n$929 M\nSource: Ackrell Capital\nRecreational Sales as a Key Market Driver\nOf the eight states that have enacted recreational laws, all had previously implemented medical laws.\nAs shown in the following graphs for the three largest states to implement recreational laws, implementation\nof a recreational law significantly expanded the overall size of the legalized cannabis market,\ndoubling the size of the market in each of these states in the first full calendar year after implementation.\nIn addition, the percentage of the total market attributable to recreational consumers increased\nquickly. This indicates significant, pent-up consumer demand for legal cannabis in the United States,\nand we expect a significant increase in the size of the overall state-legal market as more states implement\nrecreational laws.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 105\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nColorado\nColorado implemented a medical law in 2000 and a recreational law in 2014.

Consequently, our methodology for forecasting the U.S. legalized\ncannabis market is based primarily on the following factors: (i) the number of eligible U.S. consumers,\ngrouped by age; (ii) the penetration rate for each consumer age group; and (iii) the average monthly\nspending for each consumer age group.\nWe believe that the variable which will most impact the future size of the U.S. legalized cannabis\nmarket is the federal legalization process. How and when federal legalization occurs will impact other\nprimary drivers of the market, including the number of eligible consumers, penetration rates and consumer\nspending. We predict six developments relating to federal legalization: (1) the FDA will begin\napproving individual pharmaceutical-grade drugs derived from cannabis; (2) more states will adopt\nmedical cannabis laws; (3) more states will adopt recreational laws; (4) the FDA will adopt routine\napproval procedures for drugs with extracts of low-THC/high-CBD cannabis varieties; (5) the FDA\nwill adopt routine approval procedures for drugs with extracts of high-THC cannabis varieties; and\n(6) cannabis parts and derivatives will be removed from the CSA schedules (either incrementally, starting\nwith CBD, or all at once) and will be fully legal for medical and recreational purposes. (We expand\non these predicted developments in Chapter IV, U.S. Legal Landscape.)\nWe do not predict that these developments necessarily will occur in the order presented. We do\nexpect some of them to develop in parallel, and none of them depends fundamentally on any other.\nFor example, Congress could cause development (6) at any time by passing legislation that removes\ncannabis from the CSA schedules and establishes a national framework for recreational and medical\ncannabis regulation. Developments (1) through (3) largely reflect incremental developments within the\nexisting legal environment. We do not expect developments (4), (5) or (6) to occur during the current\npresidential term, but we believe that there is a reasonable chance development (4) could begin within\nthe next five years and development (5) could occur within two years thereafter. In total, we believe that\nit could take up to 10 years or more before the federal legalization process reaches development (6) and\ncannabis becomes fully legal under federal law. For our analysis, we assume (i) development (4) begins\nin 2023, (ii) development (5) follows two years thereafter and (iii) development (6) occurs by 2027 and\ncannabis becomes fully legal in the United States. (The reader is cautioned that cannabis may never be\nlegalized federally in the United States.)\nEligible U.S. Consumers\nWe used U.S. Census data to identify the number of people in the United States aged 21 years or\nolder. While some therapeutic applications of cannabis are targeted at people under 21 years of age, we\nexcluded this group of consumers from our estimates. We assumed a nominal annual growth rate for\nthe U.S. population. With more than 97% of the U.S. population currently living in a state or district\nwith at least one law that permits the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing or possession of cannabis\nor concentrates, we view the potential pool of eligible consumers to be virtually the entire U.S. adult\npopulation.\n108 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER VI\nU.S. and International Cannabis Market Estimates\nConsumer Penetration Rates\nWe assigned current and prospective consumer penetration rates to each state based on our assessment\nof whether legal consumer access to cannabis in the state should be characterized as “limited,” “moderate”\nor “broad.” This assessment was based in part on (i) the nature of the cannabis laws in each state\nand (ii) the extent of the cannabis dispensary network in each state. We assigned a specific penetration\nrate to each age group, with the 21–29 age group having the highest and the 70+ age group having the\nlowest.\nConsumer penetration rates are significantly affected by the available channels for legal access to\ncannabis. States that have only medical laws typically have lower penetration rates than states having\nboth medical and recreational laws because the qualifying-condition requirement of medical laws\nprecludes many potential consumers. Similarly, penetration rates are impacted by the widely varying\nnumber and nature of qualifying medical conditions designated by medical laws. States that designate\nmany conditions or highly subjective conditions such as “chronic pain” tend to have higher penetration\nrates than states that designate relatively few or highly specific conditions.\nPenetration rates also are affected by the reach of a state’s cannabis dispensary network. Some states\nhave extensive dispensary networks that provide convenient access to cannabis for most consumers.\nOther states have a limited number of dispensaries or networks that reach only urban areas; restricted\nnetworks can be the result of factors such as the amount of time a state has permitted legal cannabis\naccess and the prevalence of county and municipal laws restricting (or in some cases, completely banning)\ndispensary operations.\nPrior to federal legalization, we expect U.S. penetration rates to increase as states implement new\nmedical and recreational laws and expand the scope of qualifying medical conditions under existing\nmedical laws, and as the FDA begins approving pharmaceutical-grade drugs derived from cannabis.\nAlthough we believe penetration rates in states with recreational laws and robust dispensary networks\nmay fairly represent penetration rates after federal legalization, penetration rates may increase further\nas the medical efficacy of cannabis becomes better understood and negative perceptions of cannabis\ndiminish. Following federal legalization, we believe penetration rates may ultimately be as high as (or\nhigher than) those in other consumer-driven industries, such as alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceuticals.\nThe consumer penetration rates used in our analysis are as follows.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 109\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nU.S. Legalized Cannabis Market: Consumer Penetration Rate\n25%\nPath to Federal Legalization\nFDA Approves Cannabis-Derived Pharmaceuticals\n20%\nMore States Adopt Medical Cannabis Laws\nMore States Adopt Recreational Laws\n15%\nFDA Routinely Approves CBD Drugs\nFDA Routinely Approves THC Drugs\n10%\nFederal Government Legalizes Cannabis\n5%\n0%\n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030\nSource: Ackrell Capital\nMonthly Cannabis Spending\nWe estimated average monthly spending on cannabis using data provided by dispensaries in states with\nrecreational laws.

Cannabis legalization is gaining\nmomentum around the world. At least 20 countries now have medical laws that facilitate patient\naccess to cannabis or concentrates for treating specified medical conditions. Select countries with such\nlaws include Australia, Canada, Colombia and Germany; countries without such laws include China,\nJapan, Russia and the United States. While the merits of medical cannabis are currently driving legalization,\nwe believe that—like Uruguay and numerous U.S. states—other countries will ultimately\nenact and implement recreational laws.\nCanada’s legal cannabis market (presently limited to medical cannabis) is currently the largest federally\nlegal cannabis market in the world, estimated at $1.5 billion in 2017. We anticipate that Canada\nwill enact and implement its proposed recreational Cannabis Act in mid-2018 and that implementation\nwill significantly expand the size of Canada’s overall market.\nInternational Market Size Estimate Methodology\nSimilar to the methodology for our U.S. estimates, the primary factors for our international legal cannabis\nmarket estimates are the estimated number of eligible consumers, penetration rates and monthly\nspending. Of course, these and other factors affecting market size vary considerably across continents\nand regions because each country has its own unique market characteristics, including laws, culture,\nreligions, consumer preferences and disposable income.\nWe do not attempt to estimate the timing of legal changes that affect consumer penetration rates.\nRather, we estimate the size of potential international markets at maturity when penetration rates have\nstabilized. The time required for markets in particular countries to reach maturity will vary widely and,\nlike the U.S. market, could be 10 years or more.\nTo estimate average monthly consumer spending, we analyzed a country’s per capita average\nmonthly income and assumed a certain percentage was spent on cannabis products.

And as discussed earlier in this chapter, we forecast the U.S. legal cannabis market to\nreach more than $100 billion in this same period. Together, these two forecasts indicate a global legal\ncannabis market in the foreseeable future of more than $300 billion.\nIn our view, most countries located in Asia will take the longest to enact and implement cannabis\naccess laws; therefore, we have not included the markets in countries such as China, with a population\nof 1.4 billion people, or Japan, with the third highest GDP in the world, in our global market estimate.\nIf cannabis legalization continues in the United States and the rest of the world as we anticipate, we\nbelieve that many countries in Asia will ultimately follow suit. If and when that occurs, the size of the\nglobal legal cannabis market will increase significantly and, we believe, may ultimately exceed $500\nbillion annually.\nAs discussed on page 175, readers are cautioned to not place undue reliance on our opinions, predictions\nor estimates. Almost certainly, our opinions, predictions and estimates will prove inaccurate in\nsome respects. A number of factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those\nindicated by our opinions, predictions and estimates. U.S. states and countries abroad may reverse\ntheir cannabis legalization efforts. The medical efficacy of cannabis may not prove to be significant.\nCannabis may never be legalized federally in the United States. Certain factors affecting the cannabis\nindustry are discussed in more detail in Chapter IX, Cannabis Industry Risk Factors.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 115\n\nCHAPTER VII\nCapital Markets for\nCannabis Companies\nn Capital Markets Overview\nHundreds, if not thousands, of cannabis-related companies are seeking to raise capital—thus presenting\ninvestment opportunities for sophisticated investors who want to participate in the cannabis\nindustry. Investors have their choice of investing in the more than 300 publicly traded cannabis-related\ncompanies, or in the significant number of private companies raising capital. Investors may also choose\namong stock markets (both within the United States and internationally), type of security (equity\nversus debt) and type of company (companies across all segments of the industry are raising capital).\nIt is important to note, however, that most of the cannabis-related companies that are raising capital—even\npublicly traded companies—are in early stages of development, have de minimis revenue\nand are not profitable. More than 85% of the publicly traded cannabis-related companies have annual\nrevenue of less than $5 million, and less than 5% have annual revenue greater than $25 million.\nMost investors in the cannabis industry today are retail or individual investors. While an increasing\nnumber of family office and strategic investors are now participating in the cannabis industry,\nwe believe that many institutional investors (most notably the traditional venture capital and private\nequity communities) will not invest in the industry until more companies in the industry mature and\nthe legal environment becomes more favorable.\nCannabis-related companies raised more than $2.0 billion in the public and private markets in\n2017; however, except for a few transactions of notable size, many of the financings were small (less\nthan $5 million), which provides further evidence that the capital markets are being driven primarily\nby retail investors. Without traditional institutional investor support, a funding gap exists in the industry:\ncompanies are seeking to raise more capital than investors are willing or able to provide. We believe\nthat this is especially true in the private markets, where many companies struggle to raise financing.\nWe share the belief held by many that, ultimately, established companies from analogous industries—alcohol,\npharmaceutical, tobacco and consumer products—will enter the cannabis industry\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 117\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nthrough minority investment, by acquisition or otherwise. Examples of the emergence of such strategic\ninvestors include Constellation Brands, Inc.’s (NYSE: STZ) approximately $190 million investment\nin Canopy Growth Corporation (TSX: WEED) and the more than $400 million spent by The Scotts\nMiracle-Gro Company (NYSE: SMG) to acquire soil, fertilizer, hydroponic equipment and lighting\ncompanies that are supplying the cannabis industry. These types of transactions help support the valuation\nlevels in the industry and, to an extent, validate investors’ enthusiasm for the industry.\nThe stock price performance and valuations of cannabis-related companies continue to be robust,\nirrespective of the aforementioned funding gap. In general, we believe that valuations in both the\npublic and private markets are being driven more by investors’ expectations for the future growth of\nthe cannabis industry than by individual company fundamentals. Similarly, especially in the over-thecounter\nstock market in the United States—where most of the public cannabis-related companies are\ntraded—stock price fluctuations and valuations tend to be heavily influenced by the illiquidity in most\nstocks and the trading strategies of those involved. Overall, we believe that the capital markets for the\ncannabis industry will become more efficient and rational over time as we expect increased partici pation\nfrom institutional and strategic investors.\nn Public Capital Markets\nMore than 300 cannabis-related companies are traded on one or more stock markets in the United\nStates, Canada and other international locations. Although these companies are publicly traded, most\nare in early stages of development, have de minimis revenue and are not profitable. We use the term\n“cannabis-related” to include companies that participate solely in the cannabis industry and those that\nparticipate in the cannabis industry in addition to other industries or markets.\nThe ability of companies to access capital markets is dependent largely on the legal landscape\nfor cannabis in a particular country. For example, the capital markets in countries such as Canada,\nAustralia, Germany and Israel (countries that have a more permissive legal framework for can nabis)\nhave been receptive to cannabis-related companies, while the reception by capital markets in the United\nStates has been more varied.\nIn evaluating publicly traded companies, an investor should be cognizant of where the company is\ntraded, as there are significant differences across the various exchanges and markets with respect to listing\nrequirements, liquidity, independent research and types of investors. Many cannabis-related companies\nare traded on more than one market in order to attract additional investors and facilitate trading\nin multiple jurisdictions. However, we believe that it is instructive to evaluate a company based on the\nprimary market on which it trades (We determine a company’s primary market based on a number of\nfactors, including stock price history, trading volume and availability of estimates.)\nIn the United States, a limited number of cannabis-related companies are traded on the Nasdaq\nStock Market (Nasdaq), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NYSE American (NYSE\nAmerican), the NYSE’s market for small to mid-size capitalization companies. In addition, more than\n200 cannabis-related companies are traded on the over-the-counter stock market (OTC). Nasdaq and\n118 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER VII\nCapital Markets for Cannabis Companies\nthe NYSE are two of the largest and most recognized stock exchanges in the world, with stringent\nlisting, trading and corporate governance requirements. Conversely, the OTC has much less stringent\nrequirements; as a result, most publicly traded cannabis-related companies are traded on the OTC.\nIn Canada, cannabis-related companies are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the TSX\nVenture Exchange (TSXV), which is an affiliate of the TSX, and the Canadian Securities Exchange\n(CSE). The TSX is one of the world’s largest stock exchanges and, similar to Nasdaq and the NYSE,\nhas stringent listing, trading and corporate governance requirements. The TSXV focuses on companies\nwith small market capitalization and has less stringent listing requirements than the TSX. The CSE is\nfocused on micro capitalization and emerging growth companies, and it has the least stringent listing\nrequirements of the primary Canadian exchanges. In order to be listed on either the TSX or the TSXV,\na company is required to be in compliance with Canada’s Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes\nRegulations (ACMPR) and all applicable laws in jurisdictions within which it operates. (Operations\nof listed companies are restricted in jurisdictions, such as the United States, where cannabis is federally\nprohibited.) Unlike the TSX and TSXV, the CSE has allowed companies listed on its exchange to invest\nin, acquire and otherwise operate cannabis-related businesses in the United States.\nThe following table provides a summary of the cannabis-related companies traded on U.S., Canadian\nand Australian stock markets. As stated previously, many cannabis-related companies are traded\non more than one market to attract additional investors and facilitate trading in multiple jurisdictions.\nFor example, most companies traded on the Canadian markets are also traded on the OTC.\nSummary of Publicly Traded Cannabis-Related Companies\n(As of November 30, 2017)\nAverage ($U.S. millions)\nNumber of Market Enterprise LTM LTM\nCompanies Value Value Cash Debt Revenue EBITDA\nNasdaq 4 $1,033.6 $884.5 $153.6 $4.5 $44.0 –$81.1\nNYSE 1 63.5 41.3 22.2 0.0 4.6 –1.2\nNYSE American 2 152.1 145.7 7.8 1.4 7.3 –6.5\nOTC 212 46.3 65.5 5.7 25.0 14.0 0.2\nUnited States 219 $65.5 $81.2 $8.5 $24.3 $14.5 –$1.4\nToronto Stock Exchange (TSX) 6 $1,361.5 $1,311.4 $71.0 $20.8 $26.6 $0.8\nTSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) 20 131.5 123.9 10.8 3.3 1.2 –3.5\nCanadian Securities Exchange (CSE) 41 72.6 72.0 2.0 1.4 1.8 –2.8\nCanada 67 $210.6 $203.3 $11.1 $3.8 $4.0 –$2.2\nAustralian Securities Exchange (ASX) 14 $85.3 $80.1 $5.9 $0.7 $0.9 –$2.1\nAustralia 14 $85.3 $80.1 $5.9 $0.7 $0.9 –$2.1\nSource: S&P Global Market Intelligence.

This\ncapital, whether equity or debt, may be available from (i) “friends and family,” (ii) more formalized\ngroups and networks of “angel” investors, (iii) family offices, (iv) dedicated cannabis investment funds\n(currently few in number, but growing), and (v) strategic investors. However, because of the legal\nconsiderations, traditional institutional investors—most notably the venture capital and private equity\ncommunities—continue to be mostly absent from the market.\nAs with most early-stage companies in other industries, many emerging cannabis-related companies\nare trying to follow the typical progression of raising equity capital, as illustrated in the following chart.\nEquity Financing Progression for Cannabis-Related Companies\nToday\nFuture\nFriends and\nFamily\nSeed Series A Series B Series C\nInitial Public\nO�ering\nIndividual Investors\nInstitutional and Strategic Investors\nThe following table provides a summary of the reported capital (equity and debt) raised by private\ncannabis-related companies in 2016 and year to date through November 30, 2017. While the table\nindicates that significant capital is available in the private markets, we believe that the dearth of acces -\nsible institutional capital makes it challenging for many companies to raise subsequent rounds of financing\nafter successfully securing their start-up capital. In addition, the amount raised per transaction is\nsmall and there have been very few announced financings of meaningful size by private companies.\nWhile we believe that the data is informative, it is challenging to get accurate and comprehensive data\nfor the number and dollar amount of transactions that occur in private markets within the cannabis\nindustry because of the number of transactions that are not reported.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 133\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nTotal Capital Raised by Private Cannabis-Related Companies Globally\n$600\n$500\n($U.S. millions)\n$400\n$300\n$200\n$100\n$0\n2016\n2017 YTD\nAmount Raised\nNumber of Deals\nAverage Deal Size\nSource: Ackrell Capital\n$256\n65\n$4\n$483\n102\n$5\nThe following table shows the scarcity of large transactions announced by private cannabis-related\ncompanies for the year to date through November 30, 2017.\nSelected Financings by Private Cannabis-Related Companies (YTD through November 30, 2017)\n($U.S. millions)\nIssuer Amount Date\ndüber Technologies Inc. $50.0 September 2017\nEaze Solutions, Inc. 27.0 September 2017\nSurterra Holdings LLC 13.4 September 2017\nTeewinot Life Sciences Corporation 12.3 April 2017\nHound Labs, Inc. 8.1 May 2017\niUNU, Inc. 6.3 August 2017\nGreen Leaf Medical, LLC 5.9 June 2017\nRX Green Solutions LLC 5.3 July 2017\nRiver Collective 5.0 April 2017\nGreene Fox Enterprises 5.0 May 2017\n134 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER VII\nCapital Markets for Cannabis Companies\nIn addition, an increasing number of direct lenders are participating in the private debt markets\nfor cannabis-related companies. These lenders represent an important capital source for the industry,\nas typical forms of debt capital, such as bank financing, remain unavailable to most companies. As in\nother industries, debt financing is typically available only to those companies having meaningful cash\nflow or tangible assets to secure the debt. While the number of lenders is increasing, there is still a\nrelative scarcity of debt capital available to the cannabis industry, which can lead to a higher debt cost\nof capital of 200–500 basis points or more for cannabis-related companies, as compared to companies\nin other industries.\nThe following chart illustrates the type of debt that may be available to cannabis-related companies,\nrepresentative terms of such debt, and the types of companies that may be able to access debt in the\nprivate markets.\nDebt Financing Alternatives for Cannabis-Related Companies\nCost of Capital\nCovenants\nSenior\nDebt\nLease\nFinancing\nSubordinated\nDebt\nLow Double Digits\nMid-teens\nMore Restrictive\n�\nType of\nSecuritization\n(if secured):\nLand\nBuildings\nEquipment\nA/R\nInventory\n�\nType of\nBorrowers:\nCultivators\nExtractors\nDispensaries\nProduct Manufacturers\nConvertible\nDebt\nHigh-teens to 20%+\nLess Restrictive\nn Final Thoughts\nAs stated previously, valuations and stock price fluctuations in the cannabis industry continue to be\ndriven more by expectations for the cannabis industry in general than by individual company fundamentals.\nToday, in the public markets, trading volumes are too low, trading prices are too volatile and\noperating histories are too limited to place any reliance on current valuation levels in the cannabis\nindustry. We believe that this dynamic will continue until cannabis-related companies have matured\nand start to realize meaningful revenue, profitability and other financial metrics that will allow investors\nto evaluate companies within the industry by more traditional methodology.\nIt is still too early to know how the cannabis industry or its sectors will be valued in the future. It\nmay come to pass that companies in the cannabis industry are valued comparably to public companies\nin industries with similar characteristics, such as the alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceutical and consumer\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 135\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nproducts industries, especially as companies from those industries look to enter the cannabis industry,\nthrough acquisition or by other means.\nAs demonstrated by the more than $2.0 billion raised by publicly traded and private cannabisrelated\ncompanies in 2017, capital continues to be available to support the growth of the industry.\nIn the public markets, we believe that Canadian stock markets will continue to be the most receptive\nglobally (until more progress is made in the United States toward federal legalization of cannabis).\nOverview of Canadian and U.S. Stock Markets\nCanada\nUnited States\nToronto Stock\nExchange (TSX)\nTSX Venture\nExchange (TSXV)\nCanadian Securities\nExchange (CSE)\nNasdaq/NYSE\nOTC\nSummary\nLargest exchange in\nCanada and one of\nworld’s largest\nAffiliate of the TSX for\nsmaller capitalization\ncompanies\nPerceived as the\n“OTC” of the\nCanadian markets by\nmany investors\nLargest and most\nrecognized stock\nexchanges in the\nworld\nNegative reputation\nwith many investors\nand regulators\nBenefits\nHigh volume of trading\nand liquidity; brand\nrecognition; strong\ninstitutional support\nPossible uplisting to\nthe TSX; better brand\nthan the CSE\nReceptive to\ncompanies with U.S.\ncannabis operations;\nvery few listing\nrequirements\nHigh volume of trading\nand liquidity; brand\nrecognition; strong\ninstitutional support\nPossible uplisting to\nother markets; very\nfew requirements to\ntrade\nIssues\nNot receptive to\ncompanies that\nviolate U.S. federal\nlaw\nNot receptive to\ncompanies that\nviolate U.S. federal\nlaw; limited liquidity\nfor small issues\nLimited trading\nvolume and liquidity;\nsignificant price\nfluctuations; limited\ninstitutional support\nStringent listing\nrequirements\nLimited trading\nvolume and liquidity;\nsignificant price\nfluctuations; limited\ninstitutional support\nOutlook\nExpected to continue\nto attract the largest\nCanadian companies\nin the cannabis\nindustry\nViable exchange for\nsmaller Canadian\ncompanies with no\ncannabis operations\nin the United States\nViable exchange for\nsmaller Canadian\ncompanies with\ncannabis operations\nin the United States\nWith few exceptions,\ncannabis companies\nwill not be able to\nlist while federal\nprohibition continues\nCannabis companies\nwill continue to trade\non the OTC despite\nthe limited benefits\nAlthough capital continues to be available for select issuers in both the public and private markets,\nwe believe that the cannabis industry will continue to face a large funding gap for the foreseeable\nfuture, driven by the lack of institutional investors. However, we believe a growing number of retail,\ninstitutional and family office investors will support the industry in 2018 and beyond.\n136 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER VIII\nTop 100\nPrivate Cannabis Companies 2018\nIn this chapter, we present our current list of the Top 100 Private Cannabis Companies. Our determination\nto include companies on the list is subjective, and the list is intended to be a cross-section of the\ntypes of companies in the cannabis industry. Our list comprises privately held companies, primarily\nU.S. companies, companies we believe have a strong reputation or position in their market segments\nand companies pursuing a line of business we consider promising. We intend to update our list periodically,\nand we expect it may change significantly over time.\nMost companies on our list are in early stages of development, and many will need to raise capital to\nsucceed. Raising capital for early-stage companies in any industry is extremely challenging. Early-stage\ncannabis companies seeking capital face the same challenges as early-stage companies in other industries\nbut must also address challenges unique to the cannabis industry. Although we hope the companies\non our list ultimately succeed, we expect some will go out of business for any number of reasons,\nincluding lack of access to capital.\nInclusion in our list does not represent an investment recommendation or endorsement of any\nparticular company or product. We have made investments in and conducted investment banking and\nother services for companies included in the Top 100 Private Cannabis Companies 2018 list, and may\ndo so in the future. Readers should be aware that we may have a conflict of interest that could affect the\nobjectivity of our decision to include a company in the list.

The realization of one or more of these\nrisks could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of a company and\non its lenders, investors and principals. The following discussion highlights some, but not all, of these\nrisks.\nRisks Related to U.S. Federal Law\n• The manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of cannabis are strictly controlled\nunder the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), irrespective of whether such activities comply with\napplicable state law. Financial transactions in connection with cannabis-related violations of\nthe CSA may violate other federal laws. Individuals and businesses—including the principals,\nemployees, directors, agents, lenders and investors of such businesses—that violate the CSA or\nsuch other laws are subject to fines, asset seizure and imprisonment under federal law.\n• Federal statutes and policies that currently restrict or deprioritize enforcement of certain CSA\nviolations related to cannabis are subject to expiration, rescission and other changes. There can\nbe no assurance that in the future the federal government will not strictly and aggressively enforce\ncannabis-related CSA provisions.\n• If CSA controls applicable to cannabis are relaxed or repealed in the future, other federal laws\nand regulations governing the production, distribution and marketing of products for human\nconsumption, such as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, may be more strictly enforced\nby the federal government in relation to the cannabis industry.\n• CSA controls and federal enforcement priorities applicable to cannabis both preclude interstate\ncommerce in cannabis and cannabis products. As a result, it can be costly or impractical for\ncompanies in the cannabis industry to operate in multiple states and to gain economies of scale\nthrough centralized operations.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 165\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\n• Federal income tax law precludes a business that “consists of trafficking in” cannabis or cannabis\nproducts from deducting certain operating expenses in determining its federal income tax. As a\nresult, businesses in the cannabis industry may have effective tax rates significantly higher than\nother businesses subject to federal income tax, may owe tax on taxable income that is not actual\neconomic income generated by the business and may have tax liabilities in amounts that exceed\ncash reserves.\n• Because of CSA controls on cannabis and federal laws applicable to banks and other financial\ninstitutions, companies in the cannabis industry may not be able to open or maintain bank\naccounts or access products and services of traditional financial institutions, such as credit facilities,\npayment processing and insurance coverage. A lack of access to banking and other traditional\nfinancial products and services increases the time, effort and expense related to ongoing\noperations and increases risks associated with cash transactions and the use of alternative products\nand services.\n• Trademarks used by companies to identify, distinguish or indicate the source of cannabis or\nrelated products or services that are illegal under federal law are not eligible for registration under\nfederal trademark law, which is generally recognized as the most comprehensive trademark protection\navailable in the United States. Alternative means of protecting such trademarks may not\nbe available or may provide protections inferior to the protection provided by federal registration.\n• Protections afforded under federal bankruptcy law generally are not available to companies whose\nassets consist of federally illegal cannabis products or proceeds therefrom or to the creditors of\nsuch companies.\n• The federal government may pursue legal action against a state related to the state’s cannabis\nlaws, which may result in significant changes to the state’s legal landscape as it relates to cannabis\nand may materially and adversely affect cannabis businesses in the state.\n• Cannabis companies outside the United States whose business plans anticipate eventual access\nto U.S. markets face uncertainty as to the timing or nature of changes in federal law that would\nallow importation of cannabis products into the country.\nRisks Related to U.S. State and Local Laws\n• State laws and regulations that legalize or decriminalize cannabis and related activities are relatively\nnew and may change significantly or be reversed. The extent and nature of any such changes\nare not foreseeable and may force cannabis companies to materially alter their business models,\nsuffer material losses or cease operations entirely.\n• State and local laws may limit the number of cannabis businesses in the state or in a particular\nlocality, restrict the nature of such businesses (for example, by prohibiting for-profit cannabis\nbusinesses) or place restrictions on the persons permitted to own or operate such businesses.\n• Many state and local jurisdictions support legalizing or decriminalizing cannabis activities primarily\nfor the potential to generate tax revenue, and there is significant public pressure to impose\na heavy tax burden on those participating in the cannabis industry. State and local governments\nmay impose significant taxes on commercial cannabis activity and may do so unpredictably.\n166 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER IX\nCannabis Industry Risk Factors\n• There is currently a lack of broad interstate reciprocity with respect to cannabis laws.\n• Even in states where cannabis is legal under state law, local jurisdictions may impose bans or\nrestrictions that materially interfere with or effectively prevent the operation of cannabis businesses\nwithin their boundaries.\nRisks Related to the Manufacture and Sale of Cannabis Products\n• Cannabis companies are exposed to various product liability claims associated with human consumption\nof cannabis products, including claims that products cause injury, illness, possible side\neffects or interactions with other substances, or that products include inadequate instructions for\nuse or warnings concerning health risks.\n• Cannabis companies may be subject to product recalls for a variety of reasons, including product\ndefects, such as contamination. Such recalls may result in financial burdens and reputational\nharm and may subject cannabis companies to increased regulatory scrutiny.\n• Consumer perception of cannabis products can be significantly influenced by scientific research\nor findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding\nthe consumption of cannabis. Any unfavorable developments in these areas could have a material\nadverse effect on the demand for cannabis products in general or on the products or prospects of\na particular company.\nRisks Related to Early-Stage Cannabis Companies\n• Most cannabis companies are in early stages of development and have limited operational history,\nso it is difficult to accurately predict and forecast their business operations. Many cannabis\ncompanies will fail.\n• The success of many early-stage cannabis companies is premised on receiving and maintaining\nthe licenses, permits and regulatory approvals required for their proposed cannabis activities.\nMany of such companies will not receive or maintain such licenses, permits and approvals or may\nbe able to do so only at significant expense.\n• Cannabis companies’ access to the capital required to grow and to finance ongoing operations\ninvolves challenges particular to the industry’s uncertain and rapidly evolving legal landscape.\nMany early-stage companies in the cannabis industry will not be able to obtain the requisite\ncapital or will run out of capital prior to reaching profitability.\n• Early-stage cannabis companies may experience unexpected problems in the areas of product\ndevelopment and quality, manufacturing, marketing and general management, which, in some\ncases, cannot be adequately solved. Companies may also be subject to product pricing and cost\npressures and to claims of intellectual property infringement.\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 167\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\nOther Risks to Companies in the Cannabis Industry\n• The cannabis industry is extremely competitive in most segments, with certain companies having\nunique competitive advantages such as greater capital resources, first-mover advantage, more\nscalable business models and greater brand recognition.\n• To date, the research conducted on cannabinoid-derived pharmaceuticals and other cannabisbased\ntherapies is limited. There is no assurance that cannabinoid-derived pharmaceuticals or\nother medi cal products will prove effective in treating medical conditions or achieve broad market\nacceptance.\n• Given the emerging nature of the cannabis industry, there is a scarcity of qualified personnel with\ndeep industry experience and significant competition for such qualified personnel. Many cannabis\ncompanies may not be successful in attracting, training, integrating, motivating or retaining\nqualified management teams and other personnel.\n• Cannabis is an agricultural product. The occurrence of diseases, insects, pests, mold and other\ninfestations and severe adverse environmental conditions, such as fire, drought, hail, flood or\nfrost, is unpredictable, may have a potentially devastating impact on agricultural production of\ncannabis and may otherwise adversely affect the supply of cannabis.\n• The cannabis industry is particularly vulnerable to rapidly changing technology, government\nregu lation and relatively high risks of obsolescence caused by scientific and technological\nadvances. The success of cannabis companies will depend in part on their ability to anticipate\nmarket, legal, technological and other trends in the industry. Many cannabis companies will fail\nto accurately identify or predict industry trends.\n• Cannabis laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the United States vary widely and, in\nsome cases, are as complex, contradictory and rapidly changing as those within the United States.\nCannabis companies operating outside the country’s borders are subject to risks related to the\nunsettled legal environment applicable to cannabis.\n• Due to federal controls on cannabis within the United States and similar restrictions in many\njurisdictions outside the country, there is a significant black market for cannabis products.\nGovernment-regulated cannabis businesses face competition from black market partici pants and\nare subject to different market forces than those of the black market.\n168 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC\nCHAPTER X\nGlossary of Terms\nAckrell Capital, LLC a leading independent investment bank focused on the cannabis industry\nACMPR Canada’s Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations\nAeroponics a method of growing plants whereby the roots hang suspended in a nutritional aerosol\nsolution\nBankruptcy Code Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978\nBHO Butane hash oil.
