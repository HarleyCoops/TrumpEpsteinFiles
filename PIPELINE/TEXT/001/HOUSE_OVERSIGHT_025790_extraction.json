His entourage also included two \nwomen who allegedly worked as \"madams\" for Epstein, luring teenaged girls into sex trysts with the tycoon \nand his powerful and famous friends. \nAccording to The ENQUIRER's investigation, Bill spent the day playing golf at a seven-star hotel -- and then was \ninvited to dine with Brunei's sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah .....who was charged with holding a deeply-religious \nChristian beauty queen as a \"human chattel.\" Far from being embarrassed by the ruler's tawdry \nreputation, moreover, records for Bill's nonprofit foundation reveal that Brunei made a donation towards his \nClinton Presidential Library that year of between $1. million and $5 million. \nPlease kindly attempt to provide any comment by 4 pm ET tomorrow, Friday January 30th to Lachlan \nCartwright, Executive Editor, at [Office] or \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025790 \nThank You, \nPatricia Gonzalez \nThe National Enquirer \nOfficel \nE-mail: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025791 \n"
