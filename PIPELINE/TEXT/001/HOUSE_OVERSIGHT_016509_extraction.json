But in fact, some of the prominent contemporary\ncomplaints about U.S. criminal justice, as well as some longstanding ones, object to underenforcement of criminal law. Two of\nthe most notable categories are failures to prosecute in cases of unjustified police violence, especially against nonwhite victims,\nand in cases of sexual assaults. Lower-profile examples abound as well, as do historical examples.\nGiven the nation's history, underenforcement problems are often related to race. Insufficient law enforcement attention to\ncrimes in minority neighborhoods, for example, has been criticized as depriving African American victims and communities of\ntheir fair share of government protection from criminal harm. 2 In earlier eras, law enforcement inattention to, or wholesale\nneglect [*845] of, white offenders' victimization of black victims - in lynchings, attacks on civil right activists, sexual assaults,\nand other contexts - was often patent. 3 But the problem of unjustified underenforcement is not confined to these contexts, nor\nto the United States. Failures to prosecute arise from a fundamental structural challenge faced by all criminal justice systems:\nhow to ensure unbiased, evenhanded enforcement practices - safeguards in favor of justified enforcement. This challenge gets\nless attention than criminal procedure's central preoccupation of guarding against excessive or groundless criminal charges.\nConcern about misuse of the state's prosecution authority rightly motivates much in criminal procedure, from search and\nseizure rules 4 and judicial review of arrests 5 to evidence disclosure duties, 6 the right to counsel, 7 and standards of proof. 8\n1\nU.S. incarceration rates quintupled over the last forty years and are five to seven times higher than those in other advanced democracies.\nSee Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F.

Rev. 844, *845\nPage 2 of 42\nStructural responses to the state declining to use its enforcement authority are much fewer and less prominent. At least in\ncommon law countries, enforcement decisions are the province of police and prosecutor discretion, and oversight of officials'\nfailures to enforce has been left almost wholly to the political process. Decisions to search, arrest, or charge face modest\njudicial scrutiny on evidentiary grounds and - at the extreme margins - racial or [*846] ethnic bias. 9 Decisions not to arrest or\ncharge are virtually immune from judicial review or other nonpolitical oversight. 10 Like other common law jurisdictions, U.S.\njustice systems have always rejected an approach long adopted in some civil law jurisdictions to prevent unjustified and\ndisparate nonenforcement - a rule of mandatory prosecution that restricts executive officials' discretion over arrest and charging\ndecisions. 11\nA broader view, however, reveals that all criminal justice systems incorporate one or more strategies to address\nunderenforcement, which can be collectively described as redundant charging authority. All are to some degree familiar,\nthough they are not usually described in these terms or understood as serving this common purpose.\nOne approach is creation of two distinct enforcement agencies with overlapping or duplicative jurisdiction. This model is a\nfamiliar safeguard against underenforcement of transnational crimes or crimes on the high seas; international criminal law\nroutinely grants nation-states coextensive, duplicative jurisdiction to enforce international or domestic criminal laws outside\ntheir borders. International treaties on subjects such as public corruption, drug trafficking, and human trafficking 12 can be\nunderstood as agreements to create enforcement redundancy among national criminal justice agencies to solve\nunderenforcement problems by particular states. 13 The same arrangement occurs domestically for enforcement of civil or\nregulatory law when administrative agencies have overlapping, and thus redundant, [*847] jurisdiction over the same\nregulated activities. 14 The most important version of this model in the United States, however, is criminal justice federalism.\nDue to the steady growth of federal criminal law, jurisdiction, and institutional capacity over the last century, state and federal\n5\nGerstein v.

Rev. 844, *847\nPage 3 of 42\nlaw enforcement substantially overlap for many categories of crime. Much of this enforcement redundancy, as considered in\ndetail below, has been a deliberate federal response to diverse problems of underenforcement in state criminal justice. The\npoint for now, however, is the functional equivalence of duplicative federal-state jurisdiction, nation-state jurisdiction, and\nagency jurisdiction. All represent a common strategy to reduce underenforcement by empowering redundant enforcement\nauthorities: independent entities with equivalent institutional capacity and expertise share jurisdiction. If one neglects to\nenforce, the other may. Functionally, each backstops, or provides oversight of, failures to enforce by the other.\nA second model for minimizing unjustified failures to prosecute relies on private actors to create redundancy with public\nprosecutors' authority. Empowering private actors to file and litigate public law claims is familiar in many civil law contexts;\nnumerous federal statutes authorize private rights of action that enable private individuals or groups to supplement public\nagencies' law enforcement efforts. 15 Through much of the nineteenth century, this kind of duplicative public-private\nenforcement authority was a familiar feature in the criminal justice systems of many states, which permitted private parties -\nvictims - to prosecute alleged criminal wrongdoing.\nRedundant charging authority takes other forms as well. In large hierarchical agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice,\ninternal administrative review of front-line prosecutors' charging or declination decisions by higher-ups creates a version of\nredundant enforcement authority; supervisors can make independent determinations and reverse front-line prosecutors. 16\n[*848] This kind of redundancy through administrative review now exists in English, Irish, and many European criminal\njustice systems. 17\nMore ambitiously from a U.S. perspective - because it is rare here - judicial power to review prosecutorial charging decisions is\nanother means to create some degree of redundant charging authority between the executive and judicial branches. Although\ncriminal charging is a core function of the executive branch, state and federal courts have modest authority to review and bar\nexecutive officials' decisions to file criminal charges. It is only as a matter of policy that courts - with a few exceptions - are not\nempowered to address underenforcement by reviewing the executive's noncharging decisions. (This power is somewhat broader\nfor courts in England and Wales as well as in the law of a few states.) 18 This model of redundancy separates charging\nauthority - for courts as for Department of Justice supervisors, the power to order prosecutors to prosecute - from enforcement\nauthority, which includes the institutional capacity to file and litigate charges. Courts (with rare exceptions) have no\nadministrative capacity to litigate a prosecution; but they could provide some redundancy in charging authority. 19\nIn sum, charging redundancy can occur between equivalent agencies in separate governments, between public and private\nactors, or between agencies or branches of the same government. Criminal justice systems in Europe and the common law\nworld have adopted or strengthened one or more of these mechanisms in recent decades. In the United States, choices among\nthese strategies have changed over time and between jurisdictions. Nearly all states that once authorized private prosecution\nhave long since prohibited it. Federal prosecutors are organized in a centralized hierarchical agency that makes administrative\nreview possible, but few state prosecutors are similarly organized. For these reasons and others, the primary means of\nenforcement redundancy to combat underenforcement is overlapping federal- [*849] state authority made possible by the\ndistinctive U.S. model of federalism.\n15\nExamples of federal statutes authorizing private rights of action include the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (2006) (granting a private right of\naction for antitrust violations); Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h) (1994); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §\n2000e-5(f) (1994); Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12133 (1994). For an overview, see Pamela H. Bucy, Private Justice, 76 S.\nCal. L. Rev. 1, 12-54 (2002).\n16\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3771(f) (2012) (mandating review of federal prosecutor decisions within the Justice Department upon victim's request).\n17\nSee infra Part II.A.1.\n18\nSee infra Parts II.B.3-B.4.\n19\nNote that this conception of redundant authority intersects with, but is distinct from, constitutional separation of powers. In a standard\naccount (briefly put), separation of powers describes branches of government having distinct roles, authority, and competencies. In the main,\nbranches do not do the same things; they do different, rival, and complementary things. But if so empowered by the legislature, courts can\nexercise some degree of charging authority, creating limited redundancy in charging authority between the executive and judicial branches.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *849\nPage 4 of 42\nThis Article has several aims. One is to introduce the concept of enforcement redundancy and demonstrate its utility. Another is\nto highlight problems of criminal law underenforcement and to situate contemporary complaints about failures to prosecute\npolice violence and sexual assaults as specific examples of broader enforcement deficiencies that stem from bias and favoritism\nin police and prosecutorial discretion. The Article also defends the observation that enforcement redundancy strategies are\nresponses to versions of this problem. It then assesses the strengths and weaknesses of different such strategies, with primary\nattention on the effectiveness of the U.S. approach of redundant federal-state authority. A focus on three different categories of\ncriminal law underenforcement - government corruption, police violence, and sexual assaults - clarifies differences in the\neffectiveness of the U.S. approach. Federalism has proven an effective response to states' failures to address forms of public\ncorruption, and for those crimes, it is likely superior to its alternatives. Federal authority has had some success in compensating\nfor states' failures to prosecute police violence and other police wrongdoing, but its efficacy is harder to judge and arguments\nfor supplemental redundancy strategies are stronger. For sexual assaults, federal authority has failed to assert any meaningful\nenforcement jurisdiction to compensate for weaknesses in state justice systems. Despite the sustained efforts and notable\nsuccesses of reform advocates in this area, no model of enforcement redundancy has made inroads.\nThe Article proceeds as follows. Part II briefly surveys evidence of and reasons for underenforcement. The need for safeguards\nagainst unjustified nonenforcement has long been recognized in the United States and elsewhere; outside the United States, as\npart of victims' rights reforms, it has been the object of institutional reforms. Part III elaborates the mechanisms available to\naddress risks of criminal law underenforcement. The predominant options are (1) some authority for private actors to initiate or\nparticipate in criminal prosecutions; (2) judicial or administrative review of initial nonprosecution decisions by public\nprosecutors; and (3) authority for a separate, independent public prosecutor's office to bring charges when another prosecutor\nhas declined to. Other countries - out of tradition, an absence of federalism, or as part of victims' rights reforms - rely on\nversions of [*850] the first and second options. Part III also considers why U.S. victims' rights laws, which are otherwise\nrobust, lack either of these components adopted elsewhere, especially given that many state criminal justice systems relied on\nprivate prosecution for much of the nineteenth century. The likely answers help explain why the United States relies almost\nexclusively on the third option as a safeguard against underenforcement.\nFinally, Part IV assesses how effectively federalism-based enforcement redundancy addresses underenforcement, particularly\nthe recurrent, contemporary controversies around police violence and sexual assault. Redundant enforcement through\noverlapping federalism has had considerable success addressing some underenforcement problems, such as corruption by state\nand local officials, certain kinds of civil rights violations, or crimes against disfavored minority groups. 20 It is doubtful that\nprivate prosecution or judicial review could match its success. The federalism strategy has a more mixed record on the problem\nof unjustified police violence. Federal officials have succeeded where state officials have failed in overseeing reform of local\npolice departments to reduce police lawbreaking, and they occasionally prosecute and convict individual officers. 21 But the\nvast majority of incidents of police violence go unprosecuted, including most that lead to large civil settlements for victims. 22\n20\nSee, e.g., David Grann, Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI 57 (2017) (describing \"corrupt sheriffs\nand police departments\" that failed to enforce the law and were unable to solve serial murders of Native American victims); Margaret\nBurnham, The Long Civil Rights Act and Criminal Justice, 95 B.U. L. Rev. 687, 687-88 (2015) (discussing federalism-based redundancy in\nthe context of the Civil Rights Acts); Gregory L. Padgett, Racially-Motivated Violence and Intimidation: Inadequate State Enforcement and\nFederal Civil Rights Remedies, 75 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 103, 105 (1984) (advocating for federalism-based enforcement redundancy to\nensure punishment in crimes against racial minorities).\n21\nOn federal reform of local police, see Rachel A.

L. Rev. 844, *850\nPage 5 of 42\nIt is [*851] unclear what portion of those incidents merit criminal prosecution. Key facts are often disputed, and while federal\nand state jurisdiction are coextensive here, federal criminal law generally sets a higher bar for liability than state law, especially\ndue to its more onerous mens rea requirement. 23 That makes the former an imperfect backstop to the latter, because they are\nonly partially redundant. And as recent changes in federal policy suggest, 24 redundancy between governments is subject to\npolitical shifts in those governments; federal oversight of state enforcement works only if federal officials are committed to the\noversight role. Moreover, keeping prosecution in the exclusive province of executive officials keeps prosecutorial discretion\nmore closely aligned with political majorities and thereby with popular sentiments about certain groups of defendants (such as\npolice officers) and victim groups (such as criminal suspects). In this context, redundancy in state law charging by courts or\nprivate actors, rather than rival prosecutors, might make a real contribution. Finally, cases of sexual assault reveal a weakness\nof federalism-based redundancy. State and federal criminal jurisdiction in the United States overlap more than elsewhere, but\nthey are not wholly coextensive. Federal prosecutors lack authority over most assaults that do not involve public officials or\nfederal [*852] property. Sexual assaults are one context in which the enforcement strategies favored in Europe and England -\nregulated private prosecution or review of declination decisions - hold more promise.\nI. UNDERENFORCEMENT AND REASONS NOT TO PROSECUTE\nA. Sources of Unjustified Noncharging Decisions\nPublic prosecutors are the gatekeepers of criminal law enforcement, and justice systems employ a variety of safeguards against\nprosecutors' misjudgment, bias, incompetence, or laziness. Most are directed at prosecutors' charging decisions rather than\ndecisions declining to charge (i.e., declination decisions), for familiar reasons - charging creates real burdens and risks for\ndefendants. 25 Many familiar procedural components are aimed at preventing improper criminal charges or the harm they can\ncause. Requirements that charges are based on sufficient evidence are an obvious example, but double jeopardy laws and\nrestrictions on prosecutors' conflicts of interest serve the same purpose. The full range of pretrial and trial procedures designed\nto assure accurate and unbiased adjudication are intended to sort out improper charges and attach punishments only to proper\nones. 26\nSafeguards against nonenforcement, or unjustified decisions not to prosecute, are fewer, are less explicit, and (in common law\njurisdictions) are less often in the form of legal rules and mandates. One explanation for this is simply that the interests at stake\nare not as high - no individual faces prosecution and possible punishment. Another is that many non-prosecution decisions\n23\nPolice violence is often prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 242 (2012) (criminalizing the deprivation of rights under color of law).

Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 162 (1972) (same).\n26\nSee Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 156 (1968) (regarding trial by jury as a \"safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous\nprosecutor\").\nDAVID SCHOEN\n103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *852\nPage 6 of 42\nfollow from determinations that there is insufficient evidence to support charging, and common law jurisdictions [*853] have\nlong left those assessments in the unregulated discretion of police and prosecutors. 27\nBut that is not the whole story. For one, it does not follow from the fact that officials must assess evidentiary sufficiency that\ntheir assessments should be unregulated or unsupervised. The tradition in civil law jurisdictions is otherwise, and available\nevidence often depends on the effort and priority officials give to finding it. More importantly, how rigorously we guard against\nunmerited nonenforcement depends on how we value the interests harmed by nonenforcement, and on how much we worry\nabout nonenforcement for the wrong reasons. Both have changed over time.\nThe primary causes of underenforcement are failing to investigate and charge due to biases against certain victims or harms, or\nfavoritism toward certain kinds of suspects. 28 Three kinds of crimes - local government corruption, sexual assaults, and\nunjustified uses of force by law enforcement officers - illustrate the link between these risks, failures to enforce, and the\nconsequences of underenforcement. Local corruption garners the least public and political attention now; 29 not coincidentally,\nthe United States has found an effective model of enforcement redundancy on this front. 30 The justice system's responses to\nsexual assault and police violence, on the other hand, are subjects of heated political and policy debates. 31 There has been\nnotable progress in reducing the criminal justice system's disregard of [*854] both kinds of offenses, but underenforcement -\nand almost as important, widespread suspicion of underenforcement - remain significant enough that they illustrate some of the\nkey costs of those failures. Suspicion of underenforcement is itself a cost, because it reflects a loss of legitimacy for criminal\njustice institutions. That loss in turn undermines the system's efficacy if citizens decline to report victimization or otherwise\ndecline to cooperate with law enforcement officials. Evidence for those effects is strong for both sexual assaults and police\nviolence. 32 More generally, underenforcement is a form of unequal treatment that unevenly - and unjustly - distributes the\nimportant public benefits of criminal law enforcement, including the state's commitment to protect everyone equally from\nunlawful harms. 33 It also deprives victims of the private benefits that criminal justice is now widely recognized to afford, and\nowe, to victims.\n27\nSee Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 727-28 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"Law enforcement is not automatic … . What every\nprosecutor is practically required to do is to select the cases for prosecution and to select those in which the offense is the most flagrant, the\npublic harm the greatest, and the proof the most certain.\" (quoting Robert H.

L.\nRev. 1287, 1292-1303 (2016) (discussing empirical evidence of bias leading to underenforcement).\n29\nConcern about public corruption at the federal government level, by contrast, has increased, precisely where criminal and regulatory level\nare somewhat weaker.

Underenforcement Against Corruption\nCrimes of corruption by state and local officials are a good example of harms that, at times, criminal justice systems have\nunduly ignored. 34 Local police and prosecutors are not institutionally well-situated to pursue and evaluate those crimes. They\noften have professional, if not personal, ties to other local officials, which heightens the risk of undue favoritism or judgments\nthat are otherwise not fully disinterested. That is the main reason [*855] that federal investigators and prosecutors have state\nand local corruption in their portfolios. 35\n2. Underenforcement Against Sexual Assault\nSexual assault offenses are another context in which underenforcement is now widely recognized, but the causes are different.\nRather than favoritism toward offenders, the problem seems to be bias against the type of offense, and, in varying degrees,\nagainst the victims. Failures of police to rigorously pursue allegations of sexual assaults have been widely documented. 36\nAmong the explanations that advocates, attorneys and some scholars point to are \"the entrenched nature of long-recognized,\ngender-driven biases by police against domestic violence or sexual assault claims\" and \"against individuals from particular\ngroups or under particular circumstances,\" especially against victims who are poor or are racial, ethnic or gender minorities. 37\nOne large-scale empirical study of why rape-kit evidence remained untested, for example, suggested that the explanation in part\nwas \"negative beliefs and stereotypes about victims, which adversely affected the quality of the investigation.\" 38 It bears\nnoting that much of this bias is understood to be subtle or unconscious patterns built on cultural norms, rather than conscious,\npurposeful disfavor. 39 But when evidentiary records are incomplete or ambiguous, their effects are substantial.\n[*856]\n3. Underenforcement Against Police Excessive Uses of Force\nFailures to prosecute in the wake of police shootings and other possibly excessive uses of force against civilians are scenarios\nthat raise suspicions of both bias against victims, many of whom are black men (and often criminal suspects, another disfavored\nvictims and defendants\"); Natapoff, supra note 28, at 1753; David Alan Sklansky, Police and Democracy, 103 Mich. L. Rev. 1699, 1822\n(2005) (arguing that policing failures in some communities undercuts \"the egalitarian project of protecting all citizens from private\nviolence\").\n34\nThe point extends to private actors, especially organized crime, with ties to local officials.\n35\nSee infra Part III.B.1.

Rev. 844, *856\nPage 8 of 42\ngroup), and favoritism toward the class of perpetrators, law enforcement officers. 40 In the ordinary organization of criminal\njustice systems, those cases call on officials from one law enforcement agency to assess the evidence against officials from\nanother, even when the agencies regularly work together. 41 As in the context of local public corruption, conflict-of-interest\nrules 42 are far from adequate to prevent prosecutors from making judgments in light of such professional relationships and\ncircumstances. 43 The possibility of partiality is inevitable. When [*857] that possibility combines with the long history of\nracial disparities in U.S. criminal justice administration, widespread suspicion of non-prosecution decisions in cases of police\nviolence against minority civilians is hardly surprising, as the Black Lives Matter movement demonstrates. 44\n4. Other Underenforcement Contexts\nCorruption, sexual assaults, and police violence illustrate the key causes and effects of failures to enforce criminal law, but the\nsame forces are recognizably at work in other social contexts. Scholars and advocates have pointed to biases as explanations for\ninadequate law enforcement responses to offenses against undocumented aliens, sex workers, institutionalized persons, and\ntargets of anti-LGBT hate crimes. 45 Complaints that police ignored wrongdoing against racial-minority victims in minority\ncommunities were prominent in the 1970s and 1980s. 46 Some of [*858] the remedies, however - which included harsher\ndrug laws adopted with substantial support from African American politicians and communities - have proven deeply\nproblematic for those same communities. 47\nFinally, less pernicious biases and favoritism are suspected explanations for lenient enforcement patterns in lower-visibility\ncontexts, such as bicyclists killed by motor vehicle drivers, 48 employees injured on the job due to workplace safety violations,\nand bystanders shot by recreational hunters. 49 Even critics of those enforcement decisions in those settings view them as\nproducts of subtle or unconscious empathy with vehicle drivers, employers, and recreational gun users, which incline officials\n40\nPrison guard assaults on inmates raise the same concerns, although they get less public attention. For a notorious failure to prosecute\nprison guards and law enforcement officials for unjustified lethal force, see generally Heather Ann Thompson, Blood in the Water: The Attica\nPrison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy (2016).\n41\nCf.

L. Rev. 844, *858\nPage 9 of 42\nto assess conduct as non-negligent rather than reckless. 50 Yet even those relatively benign affinities can lead to sub-optimal\nenforcement policies that might benefit from redundant evaluation of charging decisions.\nB. Other Contributions to Underenforcement\nIt is worth noting that prosecutors themselves might not share those biases so much as take account of them in a local\ncommunity and jury pool. Expecting juries will be unreceptive to a case is one reason that some prosecutors cite for not\ncharging in some cases. There is evidence for this with regard to hate [*859] crimes against LGBT victim groups, for\nexample, 51 and the difficulty prosecutors have faced in convicting police officer defendants is a well-recognized hurdle in\npolice violence cases. 52 The same considerations can cut against prosecutions when victims are undocumented immigrants,\nsex workers, prisoners, and suspects in custody. 53 Redundant enforcement authority can do less to redress this barrier,\nalthough depending on its form, it is not powerless. A separate prosecuting authority might bring better investigation and fact\ndevelopment, or different jurisdictional rules that change the composition of jury venires. 54\nInadequate funding for criminal justice agencies can also play a role in aggravating areas of unjustified underenforcement.\nLack of public resources is an accepted (and inevitable) justification for declining to prosecute in some cases where evidence is\nsufficient to prove guilt. 55 But funding constraints are [*860] not an affirmative good on par with other policy-based, publicinterest\njustifications for non-prosecution, such as judgments finding that civil, regulatory, or public-health remedies are\npreferable to criminal sanctions, or concluding that third-party harms outweigh prosecution's benefits. 56 Resource constraints\nare a problem justice systems would like to minimize. Two of the three primary forms of enforcement redundancy do exactly\nthat, or have in the past. Expanding federal law enforcement jurisdiction over crimes already within state jurisdiction was\ndesigned to bring federal resources to bear on crimes where state resources were insufficient. 57 And private prosecution,\nwhere it [*861] still exists, has an equivalent effect - it permits victims to contribute private funds to public enforcement\nefforts. It is no coincidence that common law jurisdictions relied on private prosecution most heavily - through the midnineteenth\ncentury - when state capacity, including criminal justice infrastructure, was much thinner. 58\n44\nSee, e.g., Paul D. Butler, Poor People Lose: Gideon and the Critique of Rights, 122 Yale L.J. 2176, 2204 (2013) (describing protest\nmovements and other responses to racially disparate criminal justice policies); Roseanna Sommers, Will Putting Cameras on Police Reduce\nPolarization?, 125 Yale L.J. 1304, 1307-17 (2016) (describing polarized public perceptions of, and protests against, police uses of force and\nnon-prosecution of police); What We Believe, Black Lives Matter, https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/what-we-believe (last visited Oct. 30,\n2018).\n45\nSee Avlana Eisenberg, Expressive Enforcement, 61 UCLA L.

Underenforcement of criminal law by southern states through the\n1960s, when civil rights activists were the victims, are another example.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *861\nPage 10 of 42\nWhen resource constraints remain, however, they force officials to choose which cases get priority. That creates more\nopportunity for biases and favoritism to play a role in determining which cases to charge and which to forgo. That is especially\nso with crimes in which evidence development is more costly, so officials have to decide whether to invest scarce resources in\nthose that require substantial investigative efforts. Both sexual assault and police violence cases often require larger-scale\ninvestments to develop evidence sufficient for prosecution. Failures to make those investments are common reasons for nonprosecution\nin both contexts. 59\nII. MECHANISMS OF PROSECUTORIAL ACCOUNTABILITY\nFor a range of reasons and across a range of contexts, public prosecutors' failures to enforce criminal law have been of\nsufficient concern to lead contemporary justice systems to devise checks against unjustified underenforcement. Approaches\ntake three basic forms: (1) limited authority for private parties to initiate or participate in criminal prosecutions; (2) independent\nreview of initial non-prosecution decisions, upon petition from a [*862] victim; and (3) multiple, independent public\nprosecution agencies with independent authority to bring charges for the same wrongdoing. Outside the United States, the first\ntwo options predominate; their expansion in recent years is a direct consequence of broader reforms to expand crime victims'\nrights. 60 U.S. jurisdictions, however, rely almost wholly on the third model. Despite having adopted otherwise expansive\nvictims' rights laws in recent decades in response to an influential movement for crime victims' rights, state and federal laws\nconsistently and explicitly avoid granting any formal authority to private parties, or courts, over criminal charging. The next\nthree Sections provide an overview of these options, where they exist. Largely with regard to U.S. policy choices only, they\nalso suggest reasons that one model prevailed over others.\nA. Victim Rights and Private Versus Public Interests\nIn the wake of victims' rights movements in North America and Europe, crime victims now have an array of legal rights once\ncriminal charges are filed. Victims in the U.S. and European jurisdictions now commonly have rights to participate that include\nrights to consult with prosecutors, to be notified of and present at court proceedings, and to offer statements at stages such as\nhearings on bail, sentencing, and parole. 61\n48\nSee Daniel Duane, Is It O.K. to Kill Cyclists?, N.Y.

In the contexts Eisenberg describes, prosecutors\ntypically forgo hate-crime offenses in favor of other charges rather than declining to prosecute altogether. Though the focus here is on\nprosecutors, they may not be the key cause of underenforcement. For similar reasons, police may not investigate or arrest in such cases, or if\nthey do prosecution can be undermined by lax evidence-gathering. Police practices are the focus on much of the scholarship on\nunderenforcement of certain offenses. Much of the literature on inadequate enforcement of sexual assault crimes focuses on weaknesses in\nthe police rather than prosecutors. See, e.g., Tuerkheimer, supra note 28, at 1292-99 (discussing evidence of police bias).\n52\nSee, e.g., Alan Blinder, Michael Slager, Officer in Walter Scott Shooting, Gets 20-Year Sentence, N.Y.

L. Rev. 844, *862\nPage 11 of 42\nUnder the criminal justice systems of all other major common law countries and nearly all European states, victims' rights also\ninclude authority to challenge prosecutors' decisions not to prosecute, either by a limited right to initiate prosecutions as private\nparties or by enabling victims to trigger judicial or [*863] administrative review of noncharging decisions. 62 By contrast,\nnearly every U.S. jurisdiction rejects these mechanisms. State and federal laws consistently avoid permitting victims any power\nto challenge or encroach on public prosecutorial authority. Federal law, for example, explicitly dictates that \"nothing in this\n[victims' rights] chapter shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under\nhis direction.\" 63 State statutes manifest the same policy in various ways, such as by prohibiting legal remedies for violations\nof participation rights they create. 64 U.S. laws limit victims' participation to \"non-dispositive\" forms, such as providing\ninformation and personal statements to prosecutors, judges, and parole boards, which facilitates victims' influence on public\nofficials' decisionmaking. 65 But state and federal policy rejects enlisting victims as \"agents of accountability\" for public\nprosecution. 66\nIn U.S. jurisdictions and elsewhere, the conceptual innovation of victims' rights laws was to recognize victims' distinct private\n[*864] interests in public criminal litigation. Most rights are specific entitlements to advance victims' broader, dignitary right\nto be \"treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity.\" 67 These provisions conceive of victims as \"agents of\nindividual rights\" and \"independent from systemic interests,\" and their interests can either conflict or align with those of law\nenforcement. 68 At the same time, victim participation rights can also be understood to serve a broader public interest in\nprocedural outcomes, on the premise, for example, that prosecutors' and judges' decisions will improve with direct input from\nvictims. Public decisionmaking risks substantive deficiency, and criminal process would be procedurally deficient, without due\nregard for victims' interests. Jurisdictions that empower victims to challenge non-prosecution decisions enable private parties\nthemselves to address the problem of criminal law underenforcement. The remainder of this Section provides some detail on\ncontemporary forms of private prosecution authority, their capacity to advance public as well as private interests, and reasons\nfor its absence (or demise) in U.S. jurisdictions.\n1.

L. Rev. 844, *864\nPage 12 of 42\nPublic prosecutors now dominate enforcement decisions in both common law-based and civil law-based justice systems\nworldwide. That is hardly surprising, given the far-reaching regulatory scope of modern criminal law and high expectations that\nthe state will ensure security against social disorder and innumerable harms, and will intervene in risk creation long before\nmanifest criminal conduct or injury. 69 That agenda requires capacity, resources, and expertise that only public agencies can\nmarshal. Moreover, a criminal enforcement regime that relied heavily on private plaintiffs would be one skewed against redress\nfor poor victims who cannot bear litigation costs to vindicate their own interests. 70 Without safeguards, such a regime [*865]\nalso could be at the mercy of the varied, perhaps idiosyncratic motives and interests of private actors lodging criminal\ncomplaints.\nStill, many countries continue to authorize private citizens to initiate criminal prosecutions when public officials do not, and\nothers allow privately funded attorneys to assist or supplement public prosecutors in litigating criminal cases. Canada,\nAustralia, New Zealand, and England and Wales all continue to allow private prosecutions, 71 and fifteen of the twenty-eight\nmember states of the European Union grant victims some comparable [*866] authority. 72 Details vary across jurisdictions,\nbut everywhere private prosecutors' authority is limited by oversight from public [*867] prosecutors and courts. 73 The\nstandard common law model is that public prosecutors retain the power to take over privately filed charges and then either try\nthe case themselves, negotiate a plea bargain, or - more commonly when intervention occurs - dismiss the charges altogether.\nIn this framework, private actors can press charges when public officials do not, but functionally they serve primarily as a\nmechanism for political accountability. Through private charging in the wake of public prosecutors' declination, victims force\npublic officials to justify publicly their reasons for not charging and for vetoing privately filed charges - and to do so on\ngrounds other than public resource constraints, given that a private actor has offered to bear the costs. Given the private cost\nbarriers and the capacity of public prosecution agencies, it is unsurprising that, even where permitted, privately initiated\ncharges nonetheless contribute to a tiny fraction of prosecutions on criminal dockets. 74\n2.

U.S. colonies and states created public prosecution offices much\nearlier than England. 77\n[*868] Even so, in the nation's earliest decades, those officials were often part-time or short-term officials, whose duties were\noften primarily quasi-judicial or administrative. 78 For those reasons, in many states those officials coexisted alongside private\nprosecutors with whom they shared some similarities. Early public prosecutors were paid by the case or the conviction 79 and\npursued cases from private complainants. 80 But by the mid-nineteenth century, every state had public prosecutor offices of\nsome sort. 81 Increasingly, they were full-time and accompanied by [*869] public police forces. In this context, private\nprosecutions diminished, then vanished. 82\nHowever, because public prosecutors continued to suffer from poor funding (and consequently were held in low regard), 83\nsome states continued an alternate form of private prosecution: privately funded attorneys could assist in criminal prosecutions\nas long as the public prosecutor supervised or retained formal control. 84 This form of ancillary or supplementary private\nprosecution, which leaves charging decisions in public hands, is still permitted in several states. 85 Otherwise, only vestiges of\nprivate [*870] prosecution remain in a few states. Pennsylvania seems to have the strongest version: it permits private\nprosecutions for any offense upon the approval from a state prosecutor or a judge. 86 Rhode Island authorizes private\nprosecutions only for misdemeanors. 87 Under state common law, New Hampshire might permit the same for nonjailable\noffenses. 88 Beyond that, judges in many states can issue an arrest warrant or criminal summons based on a private person's\ntestimony, but public prosecutors control whether to go forward with the case. 89\n[*871] In sum, U.S. jurisdictions are unusual among common law jurisdictions in having abolished private prosecution as a\nmeans to vindicate victims' private interests, a supplement to public enforcement resources, and a structural check on selective\nunderenforcement from biases in public prosecutors' discretionary decisions not to charge. English authorities, in contrast,\nexplicitly recognize this public function for private prosecution. Private actors' authority to second-guess declination decisions -\ncharging decision redundancy - operates as \"the ultimate safeguard for the citizen against inaction on the part of the\nauthorities.\" 90 The only remnant of this view in the United States seems to be in Pennsylvania. Its courts view victim-initiated\n63\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6). Elsewhere, regarding victim complaints of rights violations to the Justice Department, the statute provides that\n\"the Attorney General … shall be the final arbiter of the complaint, and that there shall be no judicial review of the final decision of the\nAttorney General by a complainant.\" Id. § 3771(f)(2)(D); see also United States v. Thetford, 935 F. Supp. 2d 1280, 1282 (N.D. Ala. 2013)\n(\"These rights, however, do not extend to giving crime victims veto power over the prosecutor's discretion.\"); Does v.

Code Ann. § 2930.06(A) (West 2004) (\"A prosecutor's failure to confer with a victim … does not affect the validity\"\nof a decision to dismiss charges, plea agreement, or other disposition). Only a few jurisdictions, such as California and the federal system,\nprovide for meaningful enforcement of participation rights by, for example, allowing victims to intervene in trial proceedings to demand\nrights, or to appeal trial court violations; to facilitate a remedy, courts may order that a guilty plea or sentence be re-opened. See Cal. Const.\nart. I, § 28(c)(1) (stating that a victim may enforce a list of enumerated rights in trial or appellate court \"as a matter of right\"); 18 U.S.C. §\n3771(d); cf. Paroline v.

Allowing private actors to begin prosecutions meets \"the need for a\nsystem of checks and balances on the office of the district attorney\" and \"constitutes a recognition by the legislature that the\noffice of the district attorney should be subject to a system of checks and balances.\" 91\nThe rarity of private charges in jurisdictions that authorize them hardly justifies their abolition. Private prosecutions should be\nrare in well-functioning public prosecution systems, because public agencies pursue most provable cases and because private\nactors must bear considerable costs to press charges themselves. Moreover, other rules and institutions - including other\nsafeguards on prosecutorial charging - endure despite few indications of their utility. There has never been a successful claim\nthat a criminal charge violated the Equal Protection prohibition on racially biased charging, 92 but few argue the doctrine lacks\nat least normative value. 93 Grand juries rarely reject prosecutors' [*872] charging requests for indictments, but courts\ncontinue to tout them as a structural check on prosecutors. 94 Like private prosecution, these safeguards may work by deterring\nbiased or ill-conceived prosecutorial decisions; their efficacy is probably impossible to measure.\nA contributing explanation for the U.S. aversion to private prosecution may lie in a familiar theme of U.S. law and history:\nrace. During the first several decades of the nineteenth century, when private citizens could prosecute crimes, many states - and\nnot only Southern ones - either denied African Americans legal capacity as litigants 95 or barred them from testifying under\noath on the basis of race. Among other effects, those barriers barred private prosecutions by African Americans. 96 After 1865\n- an era in which rights to litigate and testify were viewed by many as more meaningful than the right to vote 97 - those racebased\nlegal disabilities were abolished. 98 In the same period, private charging authority, already on the decline, was abolished\nin most [*873] states that still permitted it. States that retained a formal litigation role for crime victims did so by allowing\nprivately funded attorneys to assist in prosecutions filed and controlled by public prosecutors, thus ensuring that public officials\nare the exclusive gatekeepers of criminal law enforcement. Between the 1840s and 1860s, prosecutors had become locally\nelected officials in nearly all states. That effectively aligned their charging monopoly with the preferences of local white\nmajorities (or white minorities in localities in which black citizens were the majority, once Southern whites succeeded in\ndisenfranchising black citizens). 99 Evidence for the relationship between race and the demise of private prosecution is\n69\nAmong myriad examples are crimes of preparation, conspiracy, possession of contraband, consensual exchanges (e.g., of drugs or sex for\nmoney), and many kinds of criminal attempts.

Local white majorities had little need for a structural check on\nprosecutors they elected, and they likely did not want a way for African-American citizens to challenge prosecutors and\nindependently pursue their interests in criminal courts. Prosecution redundancy would reduce the control of local majorities to\ndictate enforcement policies, including preferences for selective underenforcement.\nB. Judicial and Administrative Review of Decisions Not to Charge\nA second structure that creates some redundant authority over decisions not to prosecute exposes those prosecutorial decisions\nto review, either by courts or by supervising officials within an administrative hierarchy. As with private prosecution, this\nmechanism is almost nonexistent among U.S. jurisdictions, with the significant exception of federal law. But this option has\ngained ground elsewhere, in England and throughout E.U. countries. In all these contexts, its adoption responds to demands for\nexpanded victims' rights in the criminal process. This Section briefly surveys prominent examples of noncharging review in\nfederal law and Europe, then considers why state justice systems uniformly reject it.\n[*874]\n1. Oversight of Declination Decisions in Europe\nPursuant to an E.U. Directive, 100 twenty-five of the twenty-eight member states of the European Union grant crime victims\nformal rights to seek review of decisions not to file criminal charges based on their complaints. 101 The details of these review\nprocedures vary. Some authorize judicial review of prosecutors' decisions; most jurisdictions, including Scotland and France,\nprovide at least a means for review by independent officials within the prosecution agency, perhaps with an additional\npossibility for judicial review. 102 Although E.U. nations with common law-based legal systems, such as Ireland, Northern\nIreland, 103 and England, have adopted versions of this practice, the [*875] practice is more established in civil law\njurisdictions, likely because it is consistent with the longstanding duty in some civil law countries of mandatory prosecution.\n104\nProsecutions Vict., Annual Report 14-15, at 86,http://www.opp.vic.gov.au/getattachment/8bc2fefc-8715-4516-9fb8-\n57ea3e4b6342/OPP_Annual_Report_14_15_Full_web .aspx (noting that pursuant to discretion granted under § 22(b)(ii), the DPP took over\nand dismissed one private prosecution instituted for an \"improper purpose\").

Scotland is much more restrictive. See Criminal\nProcedure (Scotland) Act 1975, c. 21, § 310A (Scot.)

It is primarily an anti-discrimination injunction, intended to ensure that prosecutors treat like cases alike,\nrather than a mandate to ensure public safety and order through full enforcement. 105 Administrative and judicial enforceability\nof that duty is intended to ensure its effectiveness.\n2. Oversight of Declination Decisions in England and Wales\nThe United Kingdom was an E.U. member state when the victim's right Directive was issued, 106 and its largest criminal\n[*876] justice system - the combined jurisdictions of England and Wales - provides several grounds on which victims or other\naggrieved parties may obtain both administrative and judicial review of non-prosecution decisions. Yet the reasons for this\nrelate foremost to public rather than private interests: \"a decision not to prosecute, especially in circumstances where it is\nbelieved or asserted that the decision is or may be erroneous, can affect public confidence in the integrity and competence of\nthe criminal justice system.\" 107\nIn line with other E.U. member states, English victims can seek administrative review within the Crown Prosecution Service.\nThe process appears to be meaningful; in recent years, between seven and thirteen percent of prosecution decisions challenged\nin this way have been reversed. 108 Moreover, noncharging decisions are also subject to judicial review - a policy rarely seen\nin other common law jurisdictions. 109 The standard is deferential, but English courts do periodically overturn non-prosecution\ndecisions after evaluating them against written standards in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and other guidelines. 110 English\ncourts have disapproved of decisions not to prosecute upon finding they were based on an unlawful policy 111 or were found to\nbe [*877] \"perverse\" under a general reasonableness standard. 112 And in particular contrast to U.S. law with regard to lethal\nforce by police, English judges give special scrutiny to cases that arise from deaths in state custody, which by their nature raise\nthe specter of prosecutorial favoritism toward fellow law enforcement officials. 113\nEmployers' Insolvency (1987); Comm. of Ministers, Council of Eur., Recommendation No. R (85) 11 of the Committee of Ministers to\nMembers States on the Position of the Victim in the Framework of Criminal Law and Procedure (1985). For analysis of Directive 2012/29 as\nwell as Council of Europe recommendations, see Buczma, supra note 61, at 242-48. In Germany, victims can initiate a private prosecution for\ncertain minor offenses, and for more serious offenses may take a formal role as accessory prosecutors with rights to participate in proceedings\nand to be heard before charges are dismissed. See Strafprozessordnung [StPO] [Code of Criminal Procedure], §§374-94, translation at\nhttps://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_ stpo/englisch_stpo.html (describing rights of privateklage); id. §§153, 395-402 (describing\nrights of nebenklager); see also id.§§403-406c (describing compensation); id. § 172 (describing victim's right to seek court order to compel\npublic prosecution); Michael Bohlander, Principles of German Criminal Procedure 25, 64 (2012).\n73\nThis describes, for example, the German system that allows private parties to act as accessory prosecutors alongside public prosecutors.\nSee Strafprozessordnung [StPO] [Code of Criminal Procedure],§§153, 395-402 (describing rights of nebenklager).\n74\nSee, e.g., Commonwealth Dir. of Pub. Prosecutions, supra note 71 (reporting three private prosecutions in federal courts in 2014-15).\n75\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, state and federal justice systems were firmly committed to the principle that prosecution is an\nexclusive power of public officials in which private victims have no role or standing. See Malley v. Lane, 115 A. 674, 676 (Conn. 1921); cf.\nLinda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973) (\"[A] citizen lacks standing to contest the policies of the prosecuting authority when he\nhimself is neither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution… .

In 1704, Connecticut established what was\nprobably the first public prosecutor's office. See Jacoby, supra note 70, at 17; Kress, supra, at 103. When Blackstone described criminal law\nas predominantly directed at public wrongs, he did so in the context of a late eighteenth century justice system in which private prosecutions\nwere common.

L. Rev. 844, *877\nPage 17 of 42\n[*878]\n3. Federal Oversight of Declination Decisions\nIn the United States, only the federal justice system provides for a process of administrative review somewhat comparable to\nthose in E.U. member states. Federal law grants victims a right to seek review of prosecutors' decisions within the Department\nof Justice hierarchy, although it also explicitly bars judicial review of Justice Department decisions in this process. 114\nAlthough decision makers in an internal review process have less institutional independence from those they review than do\njudges engaged in judicial review, they also have a comparative advantage in institutional expertise, which could translate into\nless deference to, and more meaningful oversight of, front-line prosecutors.\nIn addition, federal law guarantees victims \"the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case.\"\n115 The Department of Justice interprets this not to create a right to confer before charges are filed, reasoning that no \"case\"\nexists until charges are filed. 116 Some lower courts have interpreted the statute differently, however, and concluded that it\n[*879] creates an enforceable right for victims to confer with prosecutors before, and about, the charging decision. One held\nthat prosecutors cannot enter a non-prosecution agreement with a suspect until they confer with victims, and that if they fail to\ndo so the court can order prosecutors to re-open the non-prosecution agreement. 117 A few other lower federal courts have\nreached similar conclusions, 118 although at least two have opposing conclusions. 119\nEven in its stronger form, this is a limited entitlement, in effect, to an opportunity to try to influence charging decisions. Even\nthe most aggressive federal courts on this point do not examine prosecutors' good faith during consultations or their reasons for\ndisagreeing with victims. In sum, neither the consultation right nor the right to review by Justice Department supervisors\ninfringes federal prosecutors' monopoly power over charging from judicial oversight.\nfor the court calendar). England had no full-scale prosecution agency until the creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in the Prosecution\nof Offences Act 1985. See Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, c. 23. The Director of Public Prosecutions office was established in 1879, but it\nsupplemented rather than displaced private prosecution. See Glanville Williams, The Power to Prosecute, Crim. L. Rev. 596, 601-03 (1955)\n(noting 1879 creation of Director of Public Prosecutions and describing police as de facto public prosecutors).\n79\nSee Parrillo, supra note 58.\n80\nProfessional police forces did not arise until the 1850s, so victims investigated crimes and arrested offenders. See Peggy M. Tobolowsky,\nVictim Participation in the Criminal Justice Process: Fifteen Years After the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime, 25 New Eng. J.\nCrim. & Civ. Confinement 21, 25 (1999) (explaining that, to arrest offenders, victims could enlist the \"aid of the local watchman, justice of\nthe peace, or constable for whose assistance the victim paid\").\n81\nSee, e.g., Mike McConville & Chester Mirsky, Jury Trials and Plea Bargaining: A True History 25-42 (2005) (describing early systems in\nNew York of judicial or gubernatorial appointment of prosecutors, until the office first became elective in 1847); Allen Steinberg, The\nTransformation of Criminal Justice: Philadelphia, 1800-1880, at 152-58 (1989) (stating that Philadelphia first elected its district attorney in\n1850). Prosecutors as well as judges became elected positions in many states as part of a wave of state constitutional reform in the midnineteenth\ncentury. See, e.g., Ind. Const. art. 7, § 11 (1851); Md. Const. art. 5 (1851); see also id. art. 3 (forbidding creation of state attorney\ngeneral office); Mich. Const. arts. 8, 10 (1850); N.Y. Const. art. 10 (1846); N.C. Const. art. 4, § 29 (1868); Va.

Public and private prosecutors coexisted for a few decades in some places. See\nCantrell v. Commonwealth, 329 S.E.2d 22, 25 (Va. 1985) (describing the history of private prosecution in Virginia); State v.

See Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98\nU.S. 187, 198 (1879) (Bradley, J., dissenting) (\"Every man in the community, if he has probable cause for prosecuting another, has a perfect\nright, by law, to institute such prosecution, subject only, in the case of private prosecutions, to the penalty of paying the costs if he fails in his\nsuit.\"); McConville & Mirsky, supra note 81 (describing New York courts with private prosecutors and, prior to 1847, judicial or\ngubernatorial appointments of public prosecutors); Steinberg, supra note 81, at 24-69, 152-57 (describing private prosecutions, screened by\naldermen acting as magistrates, and creation of elected district attorney's office in 1852).\n83\nRobert M.

Rev. 844, *879\nPage 18 of 42\n[*880]\n4. Oversight of Declination Decisions in State Justice Systems\nState justice systems do not go as far as the federal system does, much less provide the kind of oversight or victim recourse\nthat European systems now offer. And this is so despite the fact that all states have adopted substantial victims' bills of rights,\nnearly all of which include rights for victims to consult with prosecutors. Most make clear that the consultation right attaches\nonly after the prosecutor decides to file charges. 120 Rights of administrative review are rare. 121 One reason for that is surely\nstructural. The U.S. Department of Justice is a hierarchically organized agency within which all federal prosecutors operate, a\nstructure that enables supervisory and quasi-independent review within the agency. But few states follow that model. Instead,\nprosecutors in most states are locally elected and operate [*881] autonomously from state justice departments or attorneys\ngeneral, which generally exercise little, if any, oversight. 122 Administrative review of state prosecutors' charging decisions is\nsimply not feasible without major reorganization of state justice systems.\nThat structural barrier probably explains why state prosecutors' decisions are functionally immune to administrative oversight,\nbut the lack of judicial oversight has a different origin. In accord with common law tradition, state and federal courts have\nnever meaningfully reviewed public prosecutors' noncharging decisions. 123 In particular, they have unambiguously rejected\nvictims' claims of standing to challenge those decisions. 124 A few [*882] limited exceptions prove the rule. In cases of\nprivate criminal complaints filed by alleged victims, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania authorize judges to\nreview public prosecutors' decisions not to charge. 125 Even when statutes grant courts the power to review (or even mandate\nreview) of charging and dismissal decisions, state judges consistently have refused to scrutinize the merits of prosecutors'\njudgments. Many states have replaced the common law rule that gave prosecutors complete discretion to nolle prosequi (or\ndismiss) any criminal charge with statutes that require judges to confirm that non-prosecution is in the interest of justice. 126\nYet courts uniformly refuse to engage in meaningful review, inferring instead that those statutes require deference to\nprosecutors. 127\n84\nSee Erikson v. Pawnee Cty. Bd. of Cty.

Aside from England and Wales, courts in other common law jurisdictions - notably Canada\nand Australia - take roughly the same approach and defer to prosecutorial charging discretion. 128\n5. Summary of Declination Oversight\nBoth private prosecution and review procedures provide a kind of redundancy that checks prosecutorial declination decisions,\nand both can do so in service of public interests as well as victims' private interests. Both options have some capacity to\nchallenge prosecutorial judgments affected by political or personal biases, institutional allegiances (especially between police\nand local politicians), or other illicit sources of favor or disfavor. As one commentator put it in the English context, private\nprosecution authority recognizes that victims possess some capacity to be independent \"assessors of the evidence as well as the\npublic interest.\" 129 Review procedures enable judges and supervisory [*884] officials to do much the same thing, without the\ncost barriers for victims posed by private prosecutions. (Although it may well be that poorer victims are less likely even to\npetition for review, especially if they lack legal counsel to press their review requests.)\nWhy, then, have U.S. jurisdictions so uniformly rejected both options? As noted, both racial politics and the power of common\nlaw tradition are probable contributing reasons. 130 Another is the singular choice of most state justice systems to make\nprosecutors locally elected officials, which does much to prevent kinds of over-and underenforcement disfavored by local\nmajorities. That, in turn, likely reduces pressure for reforms that would improve other safeguards against decisions not to\nprosecute - especially decisions that cut against popular local preferences, which in many communities include rigorous\n2016) (authorizing victims dissatisfied with public prosecutor to petition the court and granting courts the power to allow victim's attorney to\ntake over as private prosecutor).\n87\nSee 12 R.I.

To extend the comparison,\npublic officials (judges) have a long track record of doing the same task that trial and grand juries do. That available substitute did not lead to\ncalls for juries' abolition.

Finally, another institution responds to some of the same underenforcement\nproblems that private prosecution and judicial review could address - redundant prosecution authority in a federal system.\nC. Federalism Safeguards on Prosecutorial Discretion\nThe scope of the U.S. federal criminal code expanded vastly in the twentieth century, as did the federal government's\ninstitutional capacity to enforce that code and its regulatory authority more generally. The result has been a distinctive form of\ncriminal justice federalism: federal enforcement authority wholly overlaps the territorial scope of state criminal law, and the\nfederal code substantially overlaps much of what is covered in state criminal codes. The resulting structure of redundant\nfederal-state authority has evolved into a means - unusual even among federal nation-states - to second-guess and effectively\ntrump state prosecutors' declination decisions without empowering courts or private parties.\nNo other nation built on a federal model incorporates nearly [*885] the same degree of redundancy between state and federal\njustice systems. 131 The more common model of criminal justice federalism is found in Canada and Germany: each has a\nsingle national criminal code that is administered by separate state-level prosecution agencies and court systems. 132 Other\nfederal states follow the U.S. model and have separate criminal codes, prosecution agencies, and court systems in each state as\nwell as for the federal government. Australia follows this model, but the scope and jurisdiction of Australian federal criminal\nlaw is much more limited than is U.S. federal law; federal crimes are largely confined to offenses that implicate distinct federal\ninterests - it is probably closer to U.S. federal criminal law in 1910 than 2010. The result is that in Australia federal criminal\nlaw enforcement overlaps much less with state criminal law. 133\nThe broad redundancy provided by U.S. federalism enables federal prosecutors to serve as checks on underenforcement by\nstate prosecutors, at least for some large and important categories [*886] of crime. In effect, federal prosecutors can review\nthe declination decisions of state prosecutors - as well as the adequacy and success of their prosecutions - and then decide\nwhether to file federal charges in cases that their state counterparts declined to pursue, charged too leniently, or in which they\nfailed to win a conviction or sufficiently harsh sanctions. (In theory state prosecutors conduct the same oversight over much of\n95\nSee George Fisher, The Jury's Rise as Lie Detector, 107 Yale L.J. 575, 671-96 (1997) (discussing the impact of racial policies in post-Civil\nWar jury and court processes).\n96\nI am aware of no historical research on African American private prosecutors, and I have found no evidence of any in case law or general\naccounts of private prosecutions.\n97\nSee, e.g., Fisher, supra note 95, at 684 n.514 (\"Denial to the freedman of the power to testify in court against the white man … strikes not\nat a mere civil franchise, but at a natural right - the right of protecting life and property. When a white man may take a freedman's life or\nproperty with impunity, if no other white men be present, the freedman has no security for either.\" (quoting The Progress of Reconstruction,\nN.Y. Times, Oct. 3, 1865, at 4)).\n98\nWhen Southern states were compelled to grant African American citizens litigation rights, they imposed strict conditions, permitting\nAfrican Americans the right to testify only when the crime victim (or the opposing civil litigant) was African American. Id. at 684. Those\nlimitations likewise restricted African Americans' private prosecution authority, although in many places racial customs, backed by the\nprospect of racial violence, was probably discouragement enough. See generally Douglas A. Blackmon, Slavery by Another Name: The Re-\nEnslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II (2008) (discussing history of African Americans' distrust of America's\njudicial system); Nicholas Lemann, Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War (2007) (exploring incidents after the Civil War and the\nimpact on politics during the Reconstruction Era).\n99\nMichael J.

The constitutional double jeopardy doctrine since at least 1922 has recognized the\n\"dual sovereignty\" of state and federal governments. Notwithstanding the guarantee that no person shall \"be subject for the\nsame offence to be twice put in jeopardy,\" the Double Jeopardy Clause has been understood not to preclude federal prosecutors'\npower to charge a person who has previously been prosecuted by state officials for the same criminal conduct, and federal\nprosecutions likewise do not limit subsequent state enforcement efforts. 135 By granting certiorari in United States v. Gamble\nthis term, 136 the U.S. Supreme Court is set to revisit this doctrine, which provides the foundation for the federalism-based\ncheck on underenforcement.\nFederal prosecutors do not attempt to keep an eye on all state prosecution decisions and practices, and federal criminal [*887]\nlaw is not fully coextensive with state criminal law; significant gaps are discussed in the next Part. But the substantive\nredundancy is considerable. For some areas of dual authority - such as drug crimes, fraud, child pornography, and human\ntrafficking - federal and state agencies often coordinate investigative efforts and divide up prosecution responsibilities. But\nfederal Justice Department policy to exercise oversight of state enforcement practices in certain categories of crime is\ndeliberate and formalized. Notable examples include state and local government corruption, excessive use of force and other\nwrongdoing by police, and other criminal civil rights violations. 137 Especially in these areas, federal prosecutors assess\nwhether to file their own charges in cases in which their state counterparts declined to charge, charged too leniently, or in\nwhich they failed to win appropriate convictions. Federal prosecution in the wake of state declination is hardly the norm - it\nshould not be, if state prosecutors decline cases for the right reasons 138 - but federal officials do remedy meaningful\nenforcement gaps left by state prosecutors. 139\nFunctionally, this inter-governmental model of review resembles intra-agency administrative review with greater independence\nbetween initial decision makers and subsequent reviewers. Oversight of state prosecutors rests with the policy [*888]\npriorities of federal executive branch officials. The Justice Department has well-established written guidelines for much of this\noversight activity, although they are not formally binding. 140 Although the Justice Department bureaucracy has a stronger\n102\nOn Scotland, see Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2014, (ASP 1) § 4 (\"The Lord Advocate must make and publish rules about the\nprocess for reviewing, on the request of a person who is or appears to be a victim in relation to an offence, a decision of the prosecutor not to\nprosecute a person for the offence.\"); Crown Office & Procurator Fiscal Serv., Lord Advocate's Rules: Review of a Decision Not to Prosecute\n- Section 4 of the Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2014, at 5 (2015),\nhttp://www.copfs.gov.uk/images/Documents/Victims_and_Witnesses/Lord%20Avocates%20Rules%20-% 20June%2015%20v2.pdf.

In\nboth settings, those with review power are prosecutors who should have greater institutional competence and legitimacy to\nsecond-guess other prosecutors' charging decisions, and consequently less inclination than courts to defer to prosecutorial\njudgments.\nThis federalist model of enforcement redundancy did not evolve from earlier common law institutional arrangements, like\nprivate prosecution, nor from the modern victims' rights movement, like judicial and administrative review of decisions not to\nprosecute. Federal criminal law enforcement expanded for several reasons, but behind many of those reasons is a common\npurpose: to remedy glaring patterns of underenforcement by the states. For example, federal law and institutional capacity\n(such as the advent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation) expanded in response to states' inability to confront adequately the\nrise of interstate violence and drug crimes (as well as, for a time, prohibition on alcohol manufacture and distribution). 142\nFederal law [*889] took on the primary role in combatting local government corruption - including police corruption and\nexcessive uses of force - which local prosecution agencies often lacked the ability, or political independence, to confront. 143\nAnd federal law has long attempted to fill the gap when racially biased local police, prosecutors, and juries declined to arrest,\nprosecute, or convict suspects - especially white ones - who victimized black citizens. 144 In sum, the redundant enforcement\n104\nStrafprozebetaordnung [StPO] [Code of Criminal Procedure], §§152, 160, 170, translation at https://www.gesetze-iminternet.de/englisch_\nstpo/englisch_stpo.html (Ger.)

All are mechanisms to guard against unjustified nonenforcement,\nor underenforcement, by jurisdictions' primary prosecution agencies. The next Part examines the relative strengths of these\nalternatives.\nIII. PROS AND CONS OF FEDERALISM-BASED ENFORCEMENT REDUNDANCY\nA. Comparative Limits of Enforcement-Oversight Strategies\nEach of the institutional approaches to reducing underenforcement of criminal law by public prosecutors has comparative\nstrengths and weaknesses. All three share the common virtue of being a means to reduce instances of bias, favoritism, or other\nmisjudgments that result in unjustified nonenforcement. All three enable outside reevaluation of declination decisions. Private\nprosecution empowers motivated private parties - crime victims - to initiate the challenge to a public prosecutor's decision not\nto charge by filing charges themselves. The same is true in jurisdictions that subject declination decisions to formal\nadministrative or judicial review; victims trigger that process by petitioning for an independent evaluation. Both of those\npractices harness the motivations of interested private parties to, in effect, screen which declination decisions should be subject\nto reassessment, although private prosecution poses a significant cost barrier for victims who want to take advantage of it. At\nthe same time, both of these practices give public officials the final [*890] word on whether a prosecution (public or private)\nwill proceed.\nThe federalism route to prosecutorial oversight, by contrast, gives private parties no formal role, although victims can file\ncomplaints and lobby federal prosecutors just as they can with local police and prosecutors for any alleged crime. Put\ndifferently, federal prosecution as check on state underenforcement rests more directly on the initiative, diligence, and\njudgment of federal prosecutors than private victims. In some areas, federal commitment is significant. 145 But it also varies\nwith the policy priorities of presidential administrations, which can vary considerably in their commitment to fighting certain\nkinds of crimes and to federal oversight of state criminal justice administration. 146\n106\nThe U.K. is scheduled to leave the European Union in 2019.

Rev. 844, *890\nPage 24 of 42\nBut that distinction has an upside: private prosecution and judicial review do not work in cases in which there is no direct\nvictim - or in which private parties do not realize they have been victimized, as in some cases of large-scale corporate or\ngovernment fraud, or in some cases of child pornography. 147 Federal prosecutors, however, take on just such cases as a core\npart of their enforcement agenda. 148 On the other hand, federal oversight is limited in other important respects: federal\ncriminal enforcement authority is not fully coextensive with state criminal law; notably, for example, it provides effectively no\nenforcement redundancy for ordinary domestic violence, rape, and other sexual assault offenses. 149\n[*891]\nB. Three Kinds of Offenses: Corruption, Police Violence, Sexual Assault\nConsider the efficacy for these oversight options with respect three types of offenses: local fraud or corruption, excessive use\nof force and other wrongdoing by local law enforcement officers, and sexual assaults. These three classes of offenses have in\ncommon that they have proven to be especially vulnerable to underenforcement. At the same time, the differences in how U.S.\ncriminal justice institutions have responded to underenforcement in each area highlight the efficacy and limits of the\nfederalism-based enforcement redundancy compared to the alternatives - both those U.S. jurisdictions reject (private\nprosecution and judicial review) and a fourth, unique strategy they embrace: politically accountable prosecutors.\n1. Public Corruption\nCorrupt conduct by government officials is a category of wrongdoing especially likely to suffer from underenforcement, for\nobvious reasons: we depend on one set of public officials, prosecutors and investigative agents, to stop wrongdoing by other\npublic officials - as well as by colleagues within their own ranks. Professional and even personal relationships often exist\nbetween these groups of public officials. Even when the boundaries between lawful and unlawful conduct are clear and law\n112\nR (Da Silva) v.

The European\nConvention on Human Rights may impose affirmative obligations on member states that certain instances require prosecutions, or that more\ngenerally require a state to maintain a criminal justice system that provides sufficient protection to citizens. English courts found that their\nestablished standards of review of noncharging decisions, based in domestic law, have been held sufficient to meet any such obligation. See R\n(FB) v.

Judges may\nrequire disclosure of internal prosecution documents, but they assess the lawfulness of nonprosecution without examining the underlying\nevidence. See R (Da Silva) v. DPP [2006] EWHC (Admin) 3204 [24] (Eng. and Wales) (noting use of redacted investigative report and case\nnotes from CPS but disavowing evaluation of evidence).\n113\nSee R v.

Decisions by U.S. courts give no special solicitude to instances of nonprosecution in the\nwake of injuries or deaths caused by prison guards or other law enforcement officials. See, e.g., Leeke v. Timmerman, 454 U.S. 84, 85-87\n(1981) (rejecting state prison inmates' federal civil claim alleging bad faith by state officials to block issuance of arrest warrants against\nguards on allegations of unnecessary beatings during prison uprising); Inmates of Attica Corr.

To facilitate\nreview, English prosecutors in some circumstances must provide public reasons for choosing not to file charges. See Jordan v. United\nKingdom (No. 2) [2003] 37 Eur. Ct. H.R. 52 PP 82-86, 122-23, 142-45 (holding that under article 2 of the European Convention on Human\nRights prosecutors should give reasons explaining a decision not to bring criminal charges after an investigation into a death caused by police\nshootings); see also R v. DPP [2001] QB 330, at 347 (Lord Bingham, CJ) (Eng. and Wales) (\"In the absence of compelling grounds for not\ngiving reasons, we would expect the Director to give reasons in such a case [of non-prosecution]: to meet the reasonable expectation of\ninterested parties that either a prosecution will follow or a reasonable explanation for not prosecuting be given … .\"); EU Council Directive\n2012/29, supra note 100, art. 6, at 67 (requiring explanations to victims that can be subjected to review).

In short, underenforcement in this realm follows more from favoritism toward offenders than the biases\nagainst victim groups or types of offenses.\n\"Corruption\" is a notoriously hard concept to define, 150 but that difficulty is actually somewhat useful for present purposes.\nSome of what constitutes public corruption is relatively clearly [*892] defined in positive law. Easy cases involve\nstraightforward property theft or embezzlement, quid pro quo bribery, and extortion. 151 Statutes also make clear at least some\ncases of illegal gratuities and breaches of regulations that govern activities such as campaign finance. 152 More ambiguous or\nmarginal cases of alleged corruption, however, illustrate the federal government's ambitious commitment to enforcing broad\ninterpretations of federal anti-corruption laws to conduct of state and local officials. That enforcement track record\ndemonstrates the strong commitment to enforcement redundancy in this area.\nStates have their own regulatory strategies to address government corruption, although independent assessments do not judge\nthem to be particularly successful. 153 The federal government seems to share that view. The Justice Department created a\nPublic Integrity Section within the Criminal Division in 1976, 154 and in the four decades since, federal prosecutors have\n[*893] aggressively prosecuted conduct of state and local officials that it determines breaches federal anti-corruption statutes.\n155 For the past two decades, federal anti-corruption prosecutions of state and local officials typically average 350-400 per year.\n156 Combatting \"public corruption\" is a top priority for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on par with combating threats of\nterrorism, foreign espionage, and cyber-warfare. 157 And many of these prosecutions targeted wrongdoing far removed from\nproperty theft or quid pro quo bribery. 158 They extend to conduct involving undue influence, breaches of fiduciary duty, or\nfailure to provide citizens with \"honest services\" 159 - wrongdoing for which the public harm is sometimes hard to identify.\n160\n[*894] By some accounts, including the U.S. Supreme Court's on occasion, 161 this enforcement agenda has been overly\naggressive. 162 But Congress has generally encouraged far-reaching federal enforcement, notably by expanding the scope of\nfederal anti-corruption law in response to narrow judicial interpretation. 163 And the key point here is that the federal executive\nCrime Victims are Criticized, Irish Times (Nov. 16, 2015), http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/new-laws-on-rights-of -crimevictims-are-criticised-1.2431095.\nBy contrast, seeSinger v.

Rev. 844, *894\nPage 26 of 42\nbranch is firmly committed to a robust enforcement policy against local government corruption that is also criminalized under\nstate law, and Congress has supported this agenda by enacting federal crimes intended to duplicate, or greatly overlap, state\noffenses. 164 In fact, federal statutes used in anti-corruption cases - [*895] like other federal criminal statutes - rely on and\nincorporate state law in federal offense definitions. In light of this structure, federal prosecutions can claim to effectuate state\nlaw goals - an especially straightforward version of federalism-based enforcement redundancy. 165\n2. Sexual Assault\nIn sharp contrast to public corruption, enforcement redundancy through coextensive jurisdiction is largely nonexistent for a\nlarge portion of the serious crimes that dominate state felony dockets, including sexual assaults, domestic violence, and\nhomicide. 166 Federal law reaches only a small number of these offenses when they intersect a special basis for federal\njurisdiction, such as interstate conduct - like human trafficking - or wrongs that occur on federal property or involve federal\nemployees. 167 For most kinds of homicides, the lack of redundancy is only a modest hindrance to adequate enforcement;\nholding aside distinctive exceptions - such as homicides by police or racially motivated lynchings - there is little evidence to\nsuggest patterns of homicide underenforcement in state justice systems. 168 Domestic violence and sexual assaults are a\ndifferent story. Like local public corruption, sexual assaults have long been a key example of [*896] serious wrongdoing to\nwhich the responses of state and local criminal justice agencies have been deeply problematic. 169\nUnderenforcement is hard to measure for sexual assaults as it is in other contexts, but central features of the problem are clear\nenough. Rape and other forms of sexual assault are dramatically underreported crimes. 170 The leading government effort to\ncollect data on sexual assaults (and other crimes), the National Crime Victimization Survey, is widely thought to undercount\nincidents of those offenses. 171 And rates of victim reports to police departments are even lower. The FBI Uniform Crime\nReports collects data on sexual assaults reported to local police agencies; the number is consistently well below the annual\nnumber reported in the National Crime Victimization Survey. 172\nOne reason that victims do not to report rapes to law enforcement is the perception that police and prosecutors (as well as\njuries) are unduly skeptical of rape allegations. 173 And there is good evidence that law enforcement agencies' responses to\n119\nSee In re Petersen, No. 2:10-CV-298 RM, 2010 WL 5108692, at 2 (N.D.

Police clearance-by-arrest rates are low. 174 Detailed studies of how police departments\nhandle reported sexual assault cases find \"substantial attrition,\" [*897] typically at the point when police decide whether to\nmake an arrest. 175 In the Los Angeles Police Department, only one report in nine was cleared by arrest; one in ten resulted in\nprosecution. 176 One hurdle lies in forensic evidence development: law enforcement agencies nationwide have suffered long\nbacklogs in testing rape evidence kits, 177 although federal funding has recently helped reduce that problem. 178\nNotoriously, things used to be much worse. Under the common law definition, rape convictions required proof that the offender\nused force to overcome the victim's \"utmost resistance.\" 179 Evidence of women's - and only women's - prior sexual conduct or\nreputation for \"unchastity\" was a permissible basis on which to infer consent. 180 The law excluded rape of one's spouse from\n[*898] the offense definition. 181 Prosecutors and police were openly skeptical of rape accusations and reluctant to\ninvestigate. 182\nYet much of this legal infrastructure intended to restrict rape law enforcement has been abolished. Rape offenses have been\nrevised to eliminate resistance requirements, and many states also removed the requirement to prove use of force. 183 Evidence\nrules are now more favorable to sexual assault complainants: rape shield laws in all jurisdictions prohibit use of a complainant's\npast sexual behavior as character evidence or a basis on which to infer consent, 184 while evidence rules in federal courts and\nnineteen states permit evidence of the defendant's past sexual offenses to show propensity to commit sexual assaults. 185 Some\npolice departments have officers specially trained in sexual assault investigations, and prosecutors' offices (as required by\nstatute in some states) have specially trained units dedicated to sexual assault prosecutions. 186 Hospitals and [*899] social\nservice agencies likewise now have staff trained in forensic interviewing and evidence-gathering in the course of aiding assault\nvictims. 187\nthat the \"prosecutor … shall confer with the victim in the case before pretrial diversion is granted … [or] before amending or dismissing a\ncharge\").\n121\nNo rights of administrative review are specified in the state victims' rights laws cited supra note 120.\n122\nFive states place all their prosecutors within a single state agency, which at least potentially makes possible hierarchical oversight. In\nNew Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Alaska, local prosecutors are appointed by, and under the supervision of, the state\nattorney general. See Steven W. Perry, Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Prosecutors in State Courts, 2005, at 2 (2006),\nhttps://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/psc05.pdf (noting Alaska, Connecticut, and New Jersey do not elect prosecutors; Delaware and Rhode\nIsland elect attorneys general who appoint all prosecutors; all other states elect prosecutors at the local level). Id. at 11. For an example of a\nstate attorney general's limited authority over locally elected prosecutors, see, for example,Va. Code § 2.2-511 (2018).\n123\nEqual protection and due process doctrines nominally empower courts to review charging decisions motivated by racial bias or retaliation\nfor exercising fundamental rights, and inquiry into selective charging implicitly requires examining biased declinations as well. But these\ndoctrines are wholly deferential to prosecutorial discretion. See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 469 (1996) (holding that equal\nprotection doctrine bars racially biased charging); Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607-08 (1985) (holding that due process bars\ncharging in retaliation for exercising fundamental rights); see also McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 312-314 (1987) (holding that statistical\nevidence of bias in death penalty administration insufficient to prove constitutional violation without proving purposeful discrimination in\ndefendant's case). For a classic account, see Kenneth Culp Davis, Discretionary Justice: A Preliminary Inquiry 188, 207-08 (1969) (\"The\naffirmative power to prosecute is enormous, but the negative power to withhold prosecution may be even greater, because it is less protected\nagainst abuse… . The plain fact is that nine-tenths of local prosecutors' decisions are supervised or reviewed by no one.\").\nDAVID SCHOEN\n103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *899\nPage 28 of 42\nThis basic overview - drawn from a substantial scholarly literature - paints a somewhat contradictory picture. On the one hand,\nthe primary story is one of longstanding underenforcement - a combination of explicit legal policies, practical evidencegathering\nand proof challenges, and cultural biases resulted in a notoriously weak response to sexual assaults by state criminal\njustice systems. On the other hand, there is a story, over the last forty years or so, of wide-ranging success in achieving reforms\non several fronts - substantive and procedural law, institutional design, and resource allocation - designed to improve\nenforcement capacity. In other words, U.S. jurisdictions made substantial progress against an ingrained tradition of\nunderenforcement without turning to any model of enforcement redundancy - federalization, private prosecution, or judicial\nreview. That is more than state justice systems were ever able to do with regard to local government corruption, where the\nremedy instead was the rise of federal criminal law enforcement.\nAnd yet, few seem to consider this reform story a success. 188 The data on underreporting by victims, low arrest rates by\npolice, and charging rates by prosecutors (along with the rape kit [*900] testing backlog) make it easy to view state criminal\njustice systems as failing to achieve adequate enforcement responses to sexual assaults despite the scope and gravity of the\nproblem - 124,000 offenses reported to police in 2015, and 431,000 assault reports estimated by the National Crime Victim\nSurvey. 189\nThis story of reform, its decidedly limited success, and the responses to that record all reveal insights about the prospects for\nredressing underenforcement through redundancy in this context. Intersecting feminist, victim rights, and rape-law-reform\nmovements have achieved some remarkable reforms through the political process over the last four decades. U.S. criminal\njustice, like U.S. public law generally, is responsive to popular sentiment, well-organized reform movements, and interest\ngroups. 190 But these movements never sought any mechanism of enforcement redundancy, and federal and state lawmakers\nnever seriously considered one. Even now, when offense definitions, victim rights, evidentiary rules, and organizational\nchanges in law enforcement agencies offer few plausible options for further improvement, there is effectively no sign of\ninterest in private prosecution and judicial or administrative oversight. Instead, the sole focus of further innovation to address\nendemic underenforcement of sexual assault offenses is the federal government. And most federal policy - and policy proposals\n- stop short of expanding federal law to cover sexual assaults now within the jurisdiction solely of state courts. 191 A notable\n124\nLinda R.S. v.

Rev. 844, *900\nPage 29 of 42\nexception is Professor Donald Dripps's current proposal to expand federal criminal law to cover most sexual assault offenses -\nprecisely the model of federal-state enforcement redundancy that [*901] exists now for drug crimes, corruption, police\nviolence, and much else. 192 But otherwise, existing policies and reform proposals emphasize more modest, although\nmeaningful, federal efforts to improve state justice administration through, for example, funding grants (as for rape kit testing)\n193 and occasionally by litigation to force institutional reforms in local agencies.\nIn fact, federal law empowers the U.S. Justice Department to sue local police departments and other agencies, and authorizes\nstructural injunctions to remedy systemic misconduct. 194 But the Department's use of this authority has largely focused on\npolice violence rather than sexual assault underenforcement. 195 Various local law enforcement agencies have entered consent\ndecrees under which they adopt institutional and policy reforms to reduce patterns of misconduct, even though federal\nintervention is hampered by the paucity of data on police misconduct, limited federal resources, and at times the political\ncommitment of the presidential administration. 196 More to the point here, in only a few cases have federal officials targeted\nlocal agencies' inadequate responses to sexual assault. 197\nIn sum, and in sharp contrast to public corruption, the problem of underenforcement in the sexual assault context reveals the\nresistance, and cost, of U.S. criminal justice to institutional structures of enforcement redundancy. Having ruled out judicial\nreview and private prosecution from the imaginations of reform-movement activists, the only alternative is the one that U.S.\ncriminal justice always favors - federalism. Where federal criminal law takes on an enforcement agenda, it is usually effective.\n198 Where tradition, politics, jurisdictional limits, or policy [*902] choices restrict the reach of federal law, as with sexual\nassault, the U.S. justice system is largely out of options. States were willing to change substantive and procedural law in hopes\nof improving rape prosecutions, but not to infringe prosecutors' monopoly control of charging by expanding modes of judicial,\nadministrative, or private-party oversight.\n3. Police Violence\n127\nNew York granted courts nolle prosequi authority in 1829, during its era of private and judicially appointed prosecutors. McConville &\nMirsky, supra note 81, at 35 (citing 1829 N.Y. Rev. Stat. tit. IV, § 68, p.730 & § 54. p.726). For a broad overview of state nolle pros laws, see\nAnnotation, Power of Court to Enter Nolle Prosequi or Dismiss Prosecution, 69 A.L.R. 240 (1930). The federal rule is Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(a).\nNote that these rules give judges implicit power to compel prosecutors to litigate charges they would rather dismiss. For decisions insisting on\njudicial deference, see, for example, Genesee Prosecutor v. Genesee Circuit Judge, 215 N.W.2d 145, 147-48 (Mich. 1974). For similar\nexamples in federal cases, see United States v. Smith, 55 F.3d 157, 159-60 (4th Cir. 1995); United States v. Perate, 719 F.2d 706, 710-11\n(4th Cir. 1983); United States v. Smith, 853 F. Supp. 179, 183-84 (M.D.N.C. 1994); Dawsey v. Gov't of Virgin Islands, 931 F. Supp. 397,\n402-04 (D.V.I. 1996). A standard explanation for deference is that judges lack means to compel prosecutors to litigate charges at trial. See,\ne.g., United States v. Greater Blouse, Skirt & Neckwear Contractors Ass'n, 228 F. Supp. 483, 489-90 (S.D.N.Y. 1964) (\"Even were leave of\nCourt to the dismissal of the indictment denied, the Attorney General would still have the right to … , in the exercise of his discretion, decline\nto move the case for trial. The Court in that circumstance would be without power to issue a mandamus or other order to compel prosecution\nof the indictment, since such a direction would invade the traditional separation of powers doctrine.\"). But judges have options short of\nmandamus. Presumably they could hold prosecutors in contempt for failures to appear, as they could for all other attorneys. And whenever\nprosecutors retain an interest charges they seek to dismiss, judges could incentivize them by ruling that failure to litigate charges results (as\nfor civil parties) in forfeiture of the claim, or dismissal with prejudice.\n128\nFor an overview of Canadian law on this point, see Mark Phillips, The Public Interest Criterion in Prosecutorial Discretion: A Lingering\nSource of Flexibility in the Canadian Criminal Process?, 36 Windsor Rev. Legal & Soc. Issues 43 (2015) (describing case law requiring great\njudicial deference to prosecutorial discretion). For Australia cases on prosecutorial discretion, see Miller v Commonwealth Dir. of Pub.\nProsecutions [2005] 142 FCR 394, 399-400 (Austl.).\n129\nManikis, supra note 60, at 29. In addition, many nineteenth-century state courts justified privately funded prosecutions by citing the\npublic value of these contributions to supplement underfunded district attorney offices. See Ireland, supra note 83, at 47, 49-51 (citing and\nquoting multiple state courts). Private prosecutors may have different reasons to proceed when despite comparatively low odds of winning a\nconviction. Some of those motivations, at least, can be public-regarding. Avlana Eisenberg makes the point that prosecuting hate crimes\ncases, for example, can have expressive and educative value that justifies pursuing well-grounded cases despite skeptical juries. Eisenberg,\nsupra note 45, at 893-95, 902-18.\n130\nFor discussions on the common law aversion to private prosecution, see Ireland, supra note 83 and for a review of the impact of racial\ntensions on private prosecution, see Blackmon, supra note 98.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *902\nPage 30 of 42\nResponses to unjustified police violence reveal a third outcome for enforcement redundancy confined to the federalism model.\nFederal enforcement authority extends to cases of police violence to a much greater degree than for sexual assaults. That\nauthority extends as well to other kinds of bias-motivated wrongdoing by both private actors and government officials, which\nlocal police and prosecutors have at times ignored or devalued, and for which state-level enforcement commitment continues to\nbe uneven. 199 Federal jurisdiction is coextensive with state jurisdiction regarding police wrongdoing, and the Justice\nDepartment's institutional capacity for enforcement probably exceeds that of its state counterparts, but in one respect the\noverlap is not complete. The key substantive criminal offenses available to prosecutors in the federal code are somewhat more\nrestrictive. The primary federal statute used to charge cases of [*903] police excessive use of force requires proof of willful\ndeprivation of rights, 200 a strict mens rea standard that makes it harder for federal prosecutors to prove liability than it would\nbe for state prosecutors relying on typical assault or homicide offense definitions. 201 The fact that Congress has for decades\nlet stand this mens rea hurdle to excessive-force prosecutions suggests that federal legislators, if not Justice Department\nofficials, are less committed to a full federal-state enforcement redundancy - or \"to altering the federal-state balance in order to\nreinforce state law enforcement\" - than they are for public corruption offenses. 202\nThat limit notwithstanding, federal prosecutions in this area have a track record of succeeding where state prosecutions failed\nor were never attempted, and in that way providing at least a partial remedy for underenforcement by state criminal justice\nofficials. Much of the federal advantage comes from the fact that federal prosecutors are, in general, better situated to\nobjectively investigate, assess, and prosecute wrongdoing by police officers than are local prosecutors who ordinarily interact\nwith and depend upon those officers (or at least their agencies). This is not a particular criticism of local prosecutors' offices; it\nis one instance of the basic problem that officials (and people generally) are untrustworthy judges of the conduct of others with\nwhom they have affiliations, allegiances, or ongoing relationships. For that reason a few states assign such cases to state-level,\nrather than local, officials. 203 And the U.S. Justice Department attempts to collect data on deaths in jails, prison, or during\n[*904] attempted arrests, to facilitate Justice Department oversight. 204 The same concerns motivate English laws applying\nspecial judicial scrutiny (when triggered by requests from victims' families) to prosecutor's decisions not to charge in the case\nof death caused by law enforcement officials or occurring in official custody. 205\n131\nSome federal states such as Germany and Canada lack enforcement redundancy because they use a single, nationwide, criminal code,\nwhich is enforced for prosecution agencies and courts organized at the state or provincial level. See generally Eric P. Polten & Eric Glezl,\nFederalism in Canada and Germany: Overview and Comparison (2014) (describing similarities in German and Canadian federalism,\nincluding allocating authority over substantive criminal law to the federal government but criminal justice administration to state or\nprovincial prosecutors and courts). In Australia, like in the United States, states and the federal government each have their own criminal\ncodes. But Australian federal criminal authority is confined much more narrowly than in the United States to conduct that implicates a\ndistinct federal interest. See generally Arther B. Gunlicks, The Lander and German Federalism 59, 72, 129 (2003) (describing German\ncriminal affairs and jurisdictions as compared to the United States); Polten & Glezl, supra, at 5-6, 10, 13-14; Brian Galligan, Comparative\nFederalism, in The Oxford Handbook of Political Institutions 261, 266-75 (Sarah A. Binder et al. eds., 2008) (discussing federalism and\njudicial review and regulations); Kathleen Daly & Rick Sarre, Criminal Justice System: Aims and Processes, in Crime and Justice: A Guide\nto Criminology 357 (Darren Palmer et al. eds., 5th ed. 2017) (examining the processes and purposes of the criminal justice system); Vicki\nWaye & Paul Marcus, Australia and the United States: Two Common Criminal Justice Systems Uncommonly at Odds, Part 2, 18 Tul. J. Int'l\n& Comp.

See Anna Petrig,\nThe Expansion of Swiss Criminal Jurisdiction in Light of International Law, 9 Utrecht L. Rev. 34, 36 (2013).\n133\nSee Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 s 10(2); Annual Report 2014-15, supra note 71.\n134\nIn unusual circumstances, two states may also have concurrent jurisdiction over the same crime, enabling one to assess the adequacy of\nthe other's enforcement effort. For a rare example, see Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 91-93 (1985).\n135\nSee U.S. Const. amend. V (Double Jeopardy Clause); Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 136-39 (1959) (affirming power of state to\nprosecute defendant after a federal prosecution for the same bank robbery); United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377, 384-85 (1922) (approving\nfederal prosecution after state prosecution based on same conduct).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *904\nPage 31 of 42\nU.S. victims lack a right to challenge noncharging decisions in cases of homicides by police. But they, along with organized\ninterest groups, can lobby prosecutors to prosecute. In some cities, voters and activist groups have pressured local prosecutors\non police violence cases. 206 It is difficult to assess what role public sentiment plays (and should play) in charging decisions.\nBut it is not hard to find instances of potent political challenges to non-prosecution of police officers in the wake of fatal\nshootings. Chief prosecutors in Cleveland, Ohio, and Chicago, Illinois, lost reelection bids in the wake controversial failures to\ncharge police officers in fatal-shooting cases. 207 In the midst of popular and activist attention on such cases, prosecutors in\nseveral other cities have charged officers for offenses related to suspects' deaths, with mixed records of success. 208 Chicago\nprosecutors did so a year [*905] after police fatally shot a suspect and only upon public release of video of the incident 209 - a\nscenario that suggests public attention corrected a noncharging decision influenced by improper considerations.\nHowever, U.S. localities vary widely in their demographics, politics, and community sentiments toward these cases. 210 That\nvariation, plus local election of prosecutors, contributes to widely varying enforcement policies across prosecution offices. 211\nAnd it means victims who urge prosecutions when local majority sentiment disfavors it have lower odds of successfully\ninfluencing [*906] prosecutors. The political variability of local prosecutors' charging policies - and the vulnerability of those\ndecisions to local sentiment that favors unjustified underenforcement - are a key reason federal redundancy is important in this\ncontext. Given that police misconduct is an established part of the U.S. Justice Department's enforcement agenda, federal\nprosecutors should be a check on political judgments of local prosecutors. They also provide victims with a different agency to\nappeal to for investigation and prosecution.\nThis federalism-based model of redundant enforcement has advantages as a strategy to reduce risks of unmerited\nunderenforcement. The alternative model authorizing judicial review of declination decisions, as is used in England, relies on\nthe independence of judges from the prosecutors whom they review. 212 The federalism model relies on the independence of\nfederal prosecutors from state prosecutors and police. The executive branch of one sovereign scrutinizes the enforcement\nresponse of another. And it has the capacity to act on its independent judgment, while courts are confined to ordering\n136\nSee United States v. Gamble, 694 Fed. App'x. 750 (11th Cir. 2017), cert. granted, Gamble v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2707 (2018). Even\nif the Court abolishes the dual sovereignty doctrine in Gamble, federal and state prosecutors will continue to be able to prosecute the same\noffenders for the same conduct in many cases. Under Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932), the Double Jeopardy Clause\nprecludes multiple prosecutions only if the subsequent charge has the \"same elements\" as the first. See United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688,\n696 (1993) (affirming Blockburger's same-elements test as the sole basis for double jeopardy claims). Unlike the firearm offenses that gave\nrise to Gamble's Double Jeopardy claim, federal and state crimes covering the same conduct often have distinct elements. For an example, see\ninfra notes 200-02 and accompanying text.\n137\nSee, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Justice, United States Attorneys' Manual, supra note 55, § 9-2.031 (explaining the \"Petite policy\" criteria for\nfederal prosecution of same conduct after state prosecution).\n138\nFor an example of a high-profile federal declination in the wake of state declination, see U.S. Dep't of Justice, Department of Justice\nReport Regarding the Criminal Investigation Into the Shooting Death of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson\n5-9 (2015), https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/pressreleases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_shooting_of_michael_brown_1.pdf.\nFor a study of federal declination, see Reuters, U.S.\nPolice Escape Federal Charges in 96% of Rights Cases, Fortune (Mar. 13, 2016),http://fortune.com/2016/03/13/us-police-federal-chargesdata\n(explaining that between 1995 and 2015, \"[federal] prosecutors turned down 12,703 potential civil rights violations out of 13,233 total\ncomplaints. By contrast, prosecutors rejected only about 23 percent of referrals in all other types of criminal cases\").\n139\nSee, e.g., Koon v.

Rev. 844, *906\nPage 32 of 42\nprosecutors to reverse their earlier non-prosecution decisions (or, occasionally, to appointing substitute prosecutors). This\n\"executive separation of powers\" model has proven effective, although whether it is effective enough is debated; it depends on\nwhether all cases of police violence that should have been prosecuted - based on the evidence and the public interest in\nenforcement - were prosecuted. State and federal prosecution offices have distinct professional cultures and are responsive to\ndifferent constituencies and modes of political supervision, which increases the independence of one from the other. 213 On the\nother hand, federal prosecution is still to some degree political; it varies with the policy priorities of presidential administrations\n214 to a degree that judicial review [*907] (in theory) should not. When there is less federal commitment to oversight of states'\napproaches to police violence, enforcement redundancy is weak. 215 Victims and other interested parties have no other\nrecourse.\nC. Underenforcement and Prosecutor Political Accountability\nIn short, U.S. strategies of enforcement redundancy have a relatively strong track record for some crimes such as public\ncorruption, are robust but vulnerable to political shifts for others such as a police violence, and are notably weak with regard to\ncertain offenses, such as sexual assaults. That last category is important because that weakness extends well beyond sexual\nassault offenses; many of the routine crimes that make up typical state criminal dockets are not within the scope of federal\ncriminal law enforcement. And since private prosecution and judicial or administrative review of prosecutorial decisions are\nalmost completely absent from state criminal justice systems, there is no charging-decision oversight of state prosecutors'\ndeclination decisions and enforcement policies - save for local electoral accountability. In forty-five of fifty states, chief\nprosecutors are directly elected in local constituencies. 216 This form of democratic accountability operates as a kind of check\non underenforcement, although it has significant limits in its capacity to play that role.\nState prosecutors' elected status is likely the best explanation [*908] for why victim-based checks on declination - private\nprosecution or judicial review - never became a part of victims' rights reforms enacted in U.S. jurisdictions in recent decades.\nFirst, prosecutors are politically powerful groups with legislatures, and they zealously guard their unfettered discretion over\ncriminal charging. 217 Second, it has led even courts to disfavor any degree of judicial review of charging decisions, on the\nOn Justice Department professionalism, see Jim McGee & Brian Duffy, Main Justice: The Men and Women Who Enforce the Nation's\nCriminal Laws and Guard Its Liberties 7-9 (1996); Jed Handelsman Shugerman, The Creation of the Department of Justice:\nProfessionalization Without Civil Rights or Civil Service,66 Stan. L. Rev. 121, 125-26 (2014).\n142\nThe arguable exceptions are federal crimes for race-based and civil rights-related violence and for local officials' abuses of power; in\nthose realms federal authorities responded to widespread failures by state law enforcement and justice systems. See generally Michal R.\nBelknap, Federal Law and Southern Order: Racial Violence and Constitutional Conflict in the Post-Brown South 154-58 (1987) (highlighting\nthe federal response to southern violence in mid-twentieth century); Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones, The FBI: A History 19-24 (2007) (tracing FBI to\nnineteenth century federal efforts to combat Ku Klux Klan terrorism of voters); William J.

Rev. 844, *908\nPage 33 of 42\nrationale that oversight of prosecutors lies in the political process rather than judicial enforcement of legal parameters for\ncharging. 218 Third, popular and political pressure has succeeded in redressing some underenforcement practices by\nprosecutors (and police) when victim groups, or issues tied to specific offenses, achieve political potency. Intoxicated driving is\nperhaps the best example of harmful wrongdoing about which many enforcement agencies have successfully revised their\npolicies to increase enforcement. 219 Domestic violence and sexual assaults are other examples where enforcement shifts have\nbeen more limited but still significant. 220\nResponses by local agencies to this type of pressure have taken three basic forms. First, chief prosecutors adopted internal\noffice policies that mandate - or set a strong presumption for - [*909] prosecution of specific crimes when evidence is\nsufficient. 221 Second, prosecutors get specialized training on how to address the particular challenges posed by specific kinds\nof cases such as domestic violence or sexual assault. 222 Finally, many offices have established dedicated, in-house units of\nprosecutors who specialize in these same kinds of crimes. 223 States legislatures have encouraged these reforms, 224 but\nvirtually everywhere, the adoption, content, and enforcement of policies is left to local chief prosecutors. No legislation sets\nspecific charging criteria, authorized judicial review, or gives enforceable rights to victims. 225\nThese responses to underenforcement are meaningful, but their form is more political than legal. They are the kinds of\nresponses produced by a system of electorally accountable prosecutors and legislatures. 226 Often they are in large part\nattributable to successful political efforts by advocacy groups. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), for example,\nsuccessfully urged reforms of laws and enforcement practices against intoxicated driving. 227 Feminist groups and women's\nadvocates play important, ongoing roles in reforming police and prosecution policies, substantive criminal laws, and evidence\nrules for domestic [*910] violence and sexual assault offenses. 228 These efforts have succeeded in changing attitudes,\nprofessional cultures, and enforcement practices in police and prosecution agencies that had contributed to underenforcement in\nthese areas. 229 Prosecution units specializing in offenses such as domestic violence, for example, strengthen professional\nculture committed to enforcement by attracting lawyers who share that commitment and who develop expertise to act on it. 230\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3 /papers.cfm?abstract_id= 3095741. Without grounds for federal jurisdiction - such as conduct involving\ninterstate travel or occurring on federal property - sexual assaults and other violent offenses are the exclusive province of state officials.

Rev. 844, *910\nPage 34 of 42\nSuccesses notwithstanding, reliance on this kind of political supervision cannot be an equally effective remedy for\nunderenforcement across all contexts. The independence of local prosecution and police agencies means that policies,\nresources, and constituent support for rigorous enforcement inevitably vary. 231 They will differ not only across localities but\nalso according to the type of offense and the identity of the victim. Some groups, such as victims of intoxicated drivers, can\nsucceed at achieving more rigorous enforcement policies. 232 Other victims with less political support or popular sympathy -\nundocumented immigrants, sex workers, prison inmates, and casualties of police shootings 233 - have dimmer prospects when\nprosecutors are responsive to local majorities' preferences. In some places, public [*911] sentiment is a force in favor of\ncharging in categories of wrongdoing that have suffered from patterns of underenforcement. In other places, the same can be a\nforce against charging and can reinforce underenforcement practices. Either way, electoral accountability can lead to undue\npressure on prosecutors to yield to majoritarian or interest-group pressure to avoid \"commiting political suicide.\" 234\nIn short, political supervision, as an institutional structure to minimize unjustified failures to prosecute, is an institutional\nstructure with a highly uneven track record and decidedly mixed prospects. On the other hand, some of the strategies for\nenforcement redundancy examined above that take the form of legal entitlements would likely also achieve partial success.\nPrivate prosecution is an unpromising device to aid certain marginalized victim groups such as inmates, undocumented\nimmigrants, or low-income people generally. Other options - review of declination by courts, or concurrent jurisdiction of a\nseparate prosecution agency - hold somewhat more promise. Judicial review is somewhat more removed from political\ninfluence (though perhaps less so in jurisdictions that elect judges), 235 although that mechanism still depends on victims to\npetition for review. The overlap of federal and state criminal jurisdiction subjects enforcement to review by a rival agency\nsubject to, at worst, different political influences. At best, as with a Justice Department that can minimize political influence\nwith professional and bureaucratic norms, it expands the prospect for less political review. 236\n(criticizing the use of federal convictions data in public corruption analysis and advocating instead for the use of administrative data).

L. Rev. 844, *911\nPage 35 of 42\n[*912]\nCONCLUSION\nAll justice systems suffer from pockets of unjustified, even pernicious, underenforcement. All recognize that public\nprosecutors can be vulnerable to biases and institutional interests that distort enforcement decisions. Especially in recent\ndecades, nearly all have adopted mechanisms to address those risks. Outside the United States, victim rights legislation has\nincluded provisions directed at unjustified decisions not to prosecute. In other common law countries and in Europe, most\nvictims may now either seek independent review of prosecutors or initiate prosecutions on their own. Independent review keeps\nthe safeguard against underenforcement in public hands while strengthening the principle that charging decisions should be\nnonpolitical and ministerial in nature. Victim rights reforms in general manifest a judgment that modern criminal justice had\nfocused excessively on public interests and unduly neglected victims' private interests in criminal prosecutions. Authorizing\nvictims to challenge declination decisions extends this idea by recognizing victims' private stake in those decisions and\nenabling victims to serve the public interest in preventing unjustified failures to prosecute. 237\nVirtually all U.S. jurisdictions reject both of those strategies. 238 And rather than insulate their prosecutors from political\n[*913] influence, most states rely on electoral politics for oversight of prosecution practices. Instead, the U.S. model opts for\nduplicative federal-state jurisdiction against a background of politically attuned state prosecutors. Both this federalism model of\nredundant prosecutorial authority - which may be reduced this term by the Supreme Court's decision in Gamble - and the model\nof politically responsive prosecutors have proven effective at redressing some types of underenforcement. Both serve some\nvictims' interests without taking the form of victim rights. And both reflect a preference for political over legal safeguards\nagainst biased or ill-conceived uses of prosecutorial discretion.\nAmerican criminal justice is more sanguine than other legal systems about the downsides of prosecutors' electoral\naccountability and attention to majoritarian sentiments. U.S. prosecutors' democratic legitimacy works against arguments for\nmore formal oversight or regulation. Even against the potent political power of victims' rights movements, unfettered executive\ncharging discretion has proven immutable. 239 But federal prosecutors provide significant oversight, at least for some\n160\nUnited States v. Alfisi, 308 F.3d 144, 155-56 (2d Cir. 2002) (Sack, J., dissenting) (arguing that payments to federal officials prosecuted\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 201 caused no clear harm or \"corruption\"); Mills & Weisberg, supra note 150, at 1373-74 (discussing the role of fiduciary\nduties in criminal liability); id. at 1377, 1386-90, 1404-05 (discussing uncertainty of \"harm\" in some contexts); id. at 1395-1400 (discussing\nhonest services); Lex Hemphill, Acquittals End Bid Scandal that Dogged Winter Games, N.Y.

United States,\n136 S. Ct. 2355 (2016) (reversing the former Virginia Governor's conviction for honest-services fraud and extortion); McNally v. United\nStates, 483 U.S. 350 (1987) (reversing the conviction of state officials and holding that federal mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, does not\napply to schemes to defraud state citizens of the intangible \"right to have the Commonwealth's affairs conducted honestly\"). As a matter of\nstatutory interpretation, the Court requires a \"clear statement\" that Congress intends a federal criminal statute to duplicate a state crime and\nthereby \"effect a significant change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction.\" United States v. Bass, 404 U.S.\n336, 349-50 (1971); see also Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 811-12 (1971). But Congress has made such intent sufficiently clear for\nthe Court in numerous statutes, including those at issue in Bass (18 U.S.C. § 1202(a), now codified at 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)) and in Rewis (18\nU.S.C. § 1952). See, e.g., Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 50 (1979) (finding that § 1952 reflects congressional intent \"to alter the\nfederal-state balance in order to reinforce state law enforcement\").\n162\nSee, e.g., Roderick M. Hills, Jr., Corruption and Federalism: (When) Do Federal Criminal Prosecutions Improve Non-Federal\nDemocracy?, 6 Theoretical Inquiries L. 113, 137-44 (2005) (arguing that federal enforcement of public corruption in local governments\nharms local styles of democracy); Harvey A.

Gross, America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs (1993)\n(examining and critiquing American drug policies).\n199\nSee, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 241 (2012) (criminalizing conspiracy); id. § 242 (criminalizing willful deprivation of federal rights while acting\nunder color of law); id. § 249 (criminalizing willful bodily injury because of victim's race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity).\nFederal prosecutors focus on other serious direct-victim crimes as well, such as human trafficking and child pornography. See U.S. Dep't of\nJustice, supra note 145 (describing prioritization of such cases). But federal involvement in that realm is presumably motivated not so much\nby a need for oversight of untrustworthy state prosecutors as by the greater resources, expertise, and interstate jurisdictional advantages that\nfederal prosecutors bring to such cases. Criminal prosecution is only one aspect of federal policies to reduce custodial deaths and improper\nuses of force by police. Other strategies include investigating abuse and corruption in local police agencies and using civil injunctive\nremedies against those agencies to change patterns of wrongdoing, as well as gathering data on custodial deaths and police uses of force.

Rev. 844, *913\nPage 42 of 42\nprofessional, rival, and politically accountable executive branch officials.\nThe insight of the U.S. approach is that, for many types of [*914] underenforcement, federal oversight combined with\ndemocratically responsive local prosecutors can perform the same function as judicial review and private prosecution of\ncorrecting bad declination decisions driven by institutional allegiances, cultural biases, and favoritism. Politically responsive\ncriminal justice sometimes works relatively well at changing prosecution practices to serve victim interests that majorities or\nstrong interest groups embrace. Politics has brought meaningful reforms to prosecution for drunk driving, for example, and it\nhas led to improvements, if still insufficient ones, regarding domestic violence and sexual assault crimes. But political\naccountability has not worked as well to remedy underenforcement when key victim groups have less public sympathy, or key\ndefendant groups, such as police, have a lot. Redundant prosecution authority, in the form of federal oversight, has a similarly\nmixed track record. Federal law has done much to compensate for state underenforcement of public corruption offenses. It has\nmade significant but less ambitious and successful commitments in the context of police violence. And federal authorities so far\nhave attempted to reinforce state sexual assault enforcement only at the margins.\nThe track record of the U.S. responses to underenforcement, then, is mixed. But it is not clear that the alternative safeguards\nthat predominate elsewhere are, on their own, clearly superior. Private prosecution is little use for victims with few financial\nresources or who are legally unsophisticated. Judicial review of declination can be exceedingly deferential, especially if statutes\nand regulations do not provide courts with clear criteria against which to assess prosecutorial decision making. Jurisdictions\nstrongly committed to reducing unjustified declinations would combine most or all of these mechanisms. U.S. jurisdictions\narguably have a history that should have made them especially likely to do so. States once permitted and relied on private\nprosecutions; judicial authority to review executive action, outside of prosecutor charging, is at least as robust here as in\nEngland; the movement for crime victim rights was as effective here as anywhere. The failure to devise more comprehensive\nsafeguards suggests that certain specific pockets of underenforcement - involving police, marginalized victim groups, and\nsexual assaults - are especially hard to remedy, regardless of readily available solutions.\nMinnesota Law Review\nCopyright (c) 2018 Minnesota Law Review Foundation\nMinnesota Law Review\nEnd of Document\nProsecution Service describes itself as \"an independent prosecution authority.\" See About the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Pub.\nProsecution Serv. Can., http://www.ppsc-sppc.gc.ca/eng/bas/dpp-dpp.html (last updated Apr. 4, 2018). The Canadian Supreme Court affirms\nthe prosecutor's wide discretion with reference to his political independence. See Krieger v. Law Society of Alta., [2002] 3 S.C.R. 372, para.\n32 (Can.) (\"The independence of the Attorney-General, in deciding fairly who should be prosecuted, is … a hallmark of a free society.\"\n(quoting In re Hoem v. Law Soc'y of B.C. (1985), 63 B.C.L.R. 36 (Can.
