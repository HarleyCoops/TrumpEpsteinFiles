Morgan Private Bank November 2012\nA brief introduction (and a promise)\nFor those of you who don’t know me from my former\nposition as Chief Investment Officer of the Global Access\nPortfolios, where I oversaw $16 billion in private and\ninstitutional client assets, I want to briefly introduce\nmyself in my new role as Chief Investment Officer of the\nJ.P. Morgan Private Bank.\nI’ve been part of the investment and strategy team at the\nPrivate Bank since 2004, when I returned to the firm to work\nwith Michael Cembalest as he assembled a global strategy\nteam to work on behalf of private clients. I was responsible\nfor global multi-asset investment strategy and asset\nallocation for our international clients before taking on the\nrole as CIO for Global Access.\nDuring my time with Global Access, I wrote a regular\ninvestment strategy note, Market Thoughts, which we sent to\nclients globally. In my new role, I want to re-establish the\ndiscipline of putting pen to paper around our market views:\nwhat we are thinking, what we are seeing as core investment\nthemes, and how we are investing across global markets.\nThere is nothing more humbling than writing down and\nclearly explaining what you think, and why, about the world\nand markets. I have a well-established practice with our\nfamily physician: I promise not to confuse him with\ninvestment nonsense if he promises not to do the same with\nmedical gibberish. I promise the same clarity with\nthis note.\nSame as it ever was\n“Once in a Lifetime” is a song by the band Talking Heads. It\nhas come to mind repeatedly as I‘ve listened to the media\ntalk about the recent U.S. elections. There is a line in the\nsong that keeps repeating the phrase “same as it ever was,”\nwhich seems to be, post-election, where we’ve landed.\nThe United States just ran a national election where an\nestimated $6 billion was spent campaigning. The result\nacross Congress, state governorships and the presidential\npopular vote was effectively a 50/50 split. Ironically, an\nelection this important is supposed to help bring\ndirection and clarity, and instead we have continued\nshort-term uncertainty. We believe that will translate\ninto a market that trends higher over the next 12 months,\nbut with air pockets.\nRight now, the most important policy debate and air\npocket is around the fiscal cliff. The good and bad news is\nwe have to see movement in the next few months. There\nisn’t a choice. The one thing that did ring clearly from the\nU.S. election is the degree of frustration around partisan\nbickering and policy inaction. This was Obama’s last\ncampaign, so he is playing for posterity. Congress recognizes\nit is already playing to mid-term elections in 2014, and while\nI never count on pragmatism from politicians, it’s actually in\neveryone’s interest for the first time in three years to\nwork together. Everyone wins, and if not, has the other side\nto blame come 2014.\nLooking ahead\nFrom a macro perspective, we believe the global\neconomy is bottoming, though we are likely to sit along\nthe bottom of a U-shaped recovery into early next year:\ngrowing, but not yet inspiring. The immediate effects on\ngrowth from Hurricane Sandy are going to need to be better\nunderstood, along with how protracted a recession Europe is\nfacing. Markets reflect expectations, and already, data that is\nless bad shows improved leading indicators, consumer\nconfidence and surprise indices. So less bad will eventually\nbe good; we simply need to see a trough in activity to lessen\nmarket uncertainty.\nEconomic data has been surprising to the upside\nEconomic surprises; Index level\n100\n50\n0\n-50\nDeveloped\nMarkets\n-100\nEmerging\n-150\nMarkets\n2009 2010 2011 2012\nSource: Citigroup, Bloomberg.

Morgan Securities LLC, Bloomberg. Data as of October 2012.\n1\nmarket thoughts\nOur core macro view remains that the global economy\ncontinues to muddle through. We see U.S. growth between\n+1.5% and 2.0%, Europe continuing to work its way out of\nrecession, and emerging economies growing +4%–5%, led\nby China as growth moves to a more sustainable trend-like\n+7%–8%. Global growth next year should be somewhere\nbetween +2.5% and 3%.\nChina has just gone through a major political transition. We\nexpect the new Government to focus on reform initiatives\nand inward investment. As my team in Hong Kong\ncontinues to remind me, 7% growth feels pretty good.\nThere simply isn’t the sense of concern or urgency in\nChina as there has been outside the country around a\nChinese hard landing. It’s a domestic economy that is\nmaturing, which is exactly what we expect to see ahead.\nWith the U.S. election behind us, we believe there should be\nlittle doubt across markets that until inflation becomes a\nmeaningful concern, central banks will continue to make\nholding cash and core bonds frustrating for investors—slowly\npushing investors to take on incremental risk across markets.\nBut like deleveraging, increased risk taking needs to be a\nprocess, not an event.\nFundamentals matter\nI’m a pragmatist in life and as an investor, especially when\nmeasuring and trying to understand risk. My team is very\nmuch macro driven, and I believe in fundamentals (as a\nparent, I have to). I like to have a view on both the upside\nand downside of an investment. My favorite investment\nratio is 2:1, when thinking about the potential upsiderelative-to-downside,\nand those investments are hard to\nfind. Credit has been one of them.\nI recently challenged our quantitative research and analytics\nteam to help me think about the benefits and the risk in\nportfolio diversification. We continue to have significant\ninvestment tilts across our portfolios, and I wanted to make\nsure we weren’t taking on additional risk because of a lack of\ndiversification. My intuition is that there is far less benefit\ntoday than there has been traditionally in a set-it and forget-it\napproach to asset allocation (something we don’t practice).\nLet me also add that there is a tremendous difference\nbetween an investor who is less diversified and one who is out\nof the market, which continues to be painful for many\ninvestors still on the sidelines.\nThe team looked back to 1991 at the correlation between\nassets across world equity, bond, commodity and foreign\nexchange markets. What we found is that correlation across\nrisk assets has been particularly high since the 2008\nfinancial crisis. You get less benefit owning a little bit of\neverything and a great deal more reward for being\ndisciplined and investing only where you see the most\nvalue. What was even more interesting is that while some of\nthis is obviously cyclical, there appears to be a structural\npattern here as well.\nCorrelation across risk assets has risen\n0.80\n0.70\n0.60\n0.50\n0.40\n0.30\n0.20\n1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011\nSource: J.P. Morgan Private Bank, Bloomberg. Data as of November 2012.\nWhy is this relevant? Because it helps explain why we’ve\nbeen comfortable barbelling the risk we’ve taken across\nportfolios this year with a significant overweight to credit\nmarkets; it’s allowed us to own less equities for similar\nreturns. Effectively, we’ve been able to take normal\nlevels of risk in portfolios but focus on the higher\ncertainty of those returns coming from yield rather than\nmore volatile equity price appreciation.\nWe still see fundamental value in our credit allocations, but\nthe return ahead is going to be driven by yield or the coupon,\nnot by bond price appreciation. I’m going to argue that it\nplaces us right where we should be in the deleveraging and\nglobal recovery cycle. It’s time to revisit the balance of how\nwe are taking risk in portfolios. If we want to achieve similar\nportfolio returns next year, we’ll need to take more\ndirectional risk where we see value across global markets.\nThe end of “easy money”\nIndex\n2012 YTD\nReturn\nAnnualized\nReturn\nRealized\nVolatility*\nGlobal Equities (MSCI World) 8.6% 10.8% 19.1%\nJ.P.

The\nfear is either that inflation very quickly begins to\nreaccelerate because of monetary policy and central banks\nwill need to aggressively slam on the policy brakes, or that\ninvestors are going to begin a Great Rotation out of fixed\nincome.\nThe Great Rotation scare being talked about argues that\nindividual investors will apparently all wake up one day and\ncollectively sell their bonds to buy stocks. For individual\ninvestors, it’s very unlikely that we will see selling of core\nbonds until investors actually lose money—and we don’t\nexpect that to happen soon. In our portfolios next year, we\nenvision owning more world equity markets, and owning\nless cash and short-duration fixed income. So I agree with\nthe risk rotation, but a mad dash by individual investors out\nof fixed income seems unnecessary and unlikely.\nThe balancing act for central banks is to try to stimulate\ngrowth without provoking inflation. There is enough excess\ncapacity in labor markets that the greater policy concern\nremains disinflationary pressure. While we are keeping a\nclose eye on inflation expectations, which have been\nrising, our economics team continues to believe inflation\ncomes after growth and therefore isn’t a threat to this\ncycle of easy monetary policy. We expect the Fed,\nEuropean Central Bank and Bank of Japan will continue to\npromote “easy money.”\nThere is going to be an inflation shock that will come with\naccelerating growth—we just don’t see it next year. But in\npreparation for that scenario, our team has already begun to\ndo work on the theme of inflation protection.\nInflation expectations remain stable\n5Y5Y forward breakeven inflation\n4%\n3%\n2%\n1%\n0%\n-1%\n-2%\n-3%\n2009 2010 2011 2012\nSource: Bloomberg.

But to borrow a phrase\nfrom my daughter, patience is the key to joy. Into year-end,\nmarkets face higher uncertainty and weaker activity. We are\ngoing to see more headlines, unfortunately with less real\nnews. In the short term, both issues will extract a higher risk\npremia from risk assets, which should create some\ninteresting opportunities.\nFor where we believe the macro cycle is right now, we\nwant to be increasing our allocation to equities as we look\ninto 2013. We continue to barbell those equity allocations\nbetween the United States, which continues to lead the global\nrecovery, and emerging markets, where we see significant\ngrowth potential. While we have added to our exposure in\nEurope and continue to see scope for investment opportunity\nahead, we don’t feel it’s a market that is gapping away from us.\nWe are also doing tactical work in our hedge fund allocations.\nWe are looking to be more directional in our risk taking\nnext year, particularly looking at long/short and eventdriven\nstrategies. In fixed income, we continue to like\ncredit, but need to be more selective. We are looking at\ntotal and absolute return fixed income strategies that can be\nmore nimble in how they invest duration. We expect to hold\nless short-duration and cash next year across portfolios.\nAs a last mention, for anyone looking for a timely read, I just\nfinished William Silber’s book about Paul Volcker. It is great\ncontext for how we got to where we are today and a\nreminder that while the past doesn’t ever exactly repeat\nitself, it does rhyme. It’s also a subtle reminder of why\nstrong leadership and bipartisan counsel are essential for\neffectively navigating the road ahead.\nI very much look forward to our ongoing investment\ndialogue with you.\nRichard Madigan\nNovember 2012\n3\nRichard Madigan is Chief Investment Officer and Head of Investment Strategy for J.P.
