    "description": "An interior photograph of a small room or utility area. The room has beige walls, a dark grey striped carpet, and a white door frame on the right. On the left wall, there are several electrical or fire alarm control panels with wires running down to the floor. A tall, cylindrical wall-mounted light fixture is lit in the center of the wall. Below the light, there are several items on the floor: a stainless steel trash can, a black bag, a brown cardboard box labeled 'SupplyHouse', and a stack of boxes labeled 'VOSS'. A piece of lumber leans against the wall on the right side. There are also light switches and a small black screen (possibly a thermostat or security panel) on the right wall.",
