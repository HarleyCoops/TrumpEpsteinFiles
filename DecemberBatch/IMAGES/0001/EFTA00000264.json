The space contains various pieces of fitness equipment, including a vertical rack holding three medicine balls (black, red, and grey/black), a purple and black abdominal roller or exercise frame, a wicker basket, and a black metal frame that appears to be part of a larger piece of gym equipment like a power rack or pull-up station. A blue exercise ball is partially visible on the floor to the right. The walls are off-white, and the floor is carpeted.",
