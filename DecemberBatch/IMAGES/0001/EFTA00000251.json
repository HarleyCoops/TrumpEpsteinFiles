    "description": "A long, narrow hallway inside a residence. The hallway features a bright blue patterned carpet with black border stripes. The walls are light-colored with decorative paneling or molding. On the right side, there are windows covered by white curtains with blue horizontal stripes. Several pieces of wooden furniture, including bookshelves and a side table with a lamp, are visible along the right wall. A large framed mirror hangs on the left wall. The perspective leads through a doorway into further rooms, where a bright flash or light source is reflected in a mirror or glass surface. Ceiling-mounted globe lights illuminate the space.",
