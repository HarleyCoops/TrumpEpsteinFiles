    "description": "A photograph of a long, narrow hallway inside a residence or hotel. The hallway features blue patterned carpeting with dark stripes running along the edges. The walls are white with decorative paneling (molding) outlined in a light blue or grey color. A large gold-framed mirror or painting hangs on the left wall. There are two visible ceiling lights: one in the foreground and one further down the hall. A doorway on the left shows a white door with a brass handle. The perspective is looking down the length of the hallway into a darker area in the distance.",
