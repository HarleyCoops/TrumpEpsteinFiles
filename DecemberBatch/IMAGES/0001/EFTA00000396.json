    "description": "An interior photograph of an empty, sparsely furnished room. The room has light yellow walls, a greyish-beige floor with some visible wear or residue, and a white door standing open to reveal a hallway and another room. Two black, cylindrical, modern-style side tables or stools are positioned against the back wall. On one of these tables, there is a white telephone and a yellow container (possibly wipes). A yellow power cord and a white phone cord are visible running along the wall. In the bottom right corner, a yellow extension cord reel and a red power tool (possibly a drill) lie on the floor. The ceiling has recessed lighting and a vent.",
