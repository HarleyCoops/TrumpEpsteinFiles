The room features white walls with gold trim, a marble fireplace with gold accents, and a checkered marble floor with dark diamond-shaped tiles. Two ornate gold-framed mirrors are mounted on the walls, each above a matching gold console table. A portrait of a man with a yellow-toned face is hung above the fireplace. Lamps with cream-colored shades are placed on the console tables. A black wrought-iron railing is visible in the foreground.",
