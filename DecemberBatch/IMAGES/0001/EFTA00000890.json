To the left, there is a wall with wood-grain paneling or wallpaper, two framed black-and-white photographs, and a small dark sculpture on a pedestal. In the foreground, two white leather armchairs are visible. A tall, thin floor lamp stands between the wood wall and the bookshelf. A red 'PLEASE Take A Number' ticket dispenser is mounted on the side of the bookshelf.",
