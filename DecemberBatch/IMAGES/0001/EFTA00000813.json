A ceiling light with a gold-colored base is on. There is an open ceiling tile revealing wires. On the left wall, there is a gray rectangular panel. A white plastic shopping bag with the word 'DUANE' visible is on the floor. In the background, there is a counter with various items including yellow power tools (possibly DeWalt or Ryobi), boxes, and a roll of paper towels. A black tool bag and other items are on the floor in the corner.",
