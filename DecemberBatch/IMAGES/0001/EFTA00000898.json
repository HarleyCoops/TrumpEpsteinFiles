    "description": "A photograph showing the interior of a small closet or storage room. Inside the closet, there are two tall, white wire shelving units with multiple pull-out drawers. The drawers appear to contain various papers, folders, and documents. On top of the shelving units, there are stacks of books and more papers. Visible book titles include 'TOEFL iBT' and 'FIRE AND FURY'. The closet is viewed through an open white door. The wall outside the closet has a light-colored wood-grain patterned wallpaper and white trim/molding. The floor inside the closet is dark, possibly black carpeting.",
