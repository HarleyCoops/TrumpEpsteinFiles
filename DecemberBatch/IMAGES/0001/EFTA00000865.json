Below the large screens are several smaller computer monitors. On the white desk surface, there is an open laptop, a keyboard, a mouse, a calculator, a landline telephone, various office supplies (tissues, spray bottles, pens), and some papers. An office chair is positioned in front of the desk. In the background, an open door leads to another room where a printer and some storage are visible. A small sign with the letter 'A' is on the door.",
