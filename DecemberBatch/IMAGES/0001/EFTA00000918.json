There are three white, plush, textured armchairs arranged around a small, ornate black and gold octagonal table that has a chessboard on top. Behind the seating area is a long, dark console table with a marble top, displaying several decorative objects including two white stylized head sculptures and a dark circular platter. Above the console is a large wooden staircase with an ornate wrought-iron railing. A portion of a painted ceiling mural and a white decorative rope or fabric hanging are visible in the upper right corner.",
