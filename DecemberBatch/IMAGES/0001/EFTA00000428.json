On the left, there is a large industrial-style blue and red ironing machine (mangle) with white and yellow rollers. Above it is a garment rack with several white shirts on hangers. In the center background, there are white cabinets with drawers, a mirror reflecting the room, and a flat-screen television. To the right, there is a white table covered with a white cloth, an iron resting on a wall-mounted shelf, and a portion of a white washing machine or dryer in the foreground. The walls and cabinetry are white.",
