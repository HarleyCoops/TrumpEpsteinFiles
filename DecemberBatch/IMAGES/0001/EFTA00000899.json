    "description": "An interior photograph of an office or study. In the foreground, a dark red desk surface holds two white multi-line office telephones with coiled cords and a white computer keyboard. A large computer monitor is partially visible, reflecting the room. In the mid-ground, a large, cylindrical white lampshade hangs from the ceiling. Behind it is a white door, slightly ajar, leading to what appears to be a bathroom with a mirror and sink. The wall to the right is covered in wood-grain paneling and features three framed black-and-white portraits. Below the portraits is a white leather sofa. The lighting is a mix of ambient light and a strong flash, creating deep shadows.",
