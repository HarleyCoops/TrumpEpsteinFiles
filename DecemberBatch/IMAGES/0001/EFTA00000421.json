On the left, several cardboard boxes are stacked, one of which has 'Crate & Barrel' branding. A hand truck is leaning against the boxes. In the center, there is a gray and silver machine, possibly a shredder or air purifier. On the right wall, there is a large, framed black and white photograph of a person in a white robe crouching on a wooden deck. The person's face is obscured by a black box. In the background, there is a gray door with a circular window and a red fire extinguisher mounted on the wall next to it.",
