    "description": "A photograph of an interior hallway or room corner. The walls are covered in a light-colored patterned wallpaper. A bronze or dark metal statue of a young boy wearing a cap and jacket sits on a wooden bench with a red, black, and tan striped cushion. Behind the bench on the wall are two dark rectangular framed artworks, one appearing to contain a mounted insect. To the left, an open doorway leads to another room where a large piece of art depicting a zebra is visible. A small white sign with the letter 'E' is taped to the wall near the doorway.",
