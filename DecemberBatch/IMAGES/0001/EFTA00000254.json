The room contains complex plumbing, including copper pipes, insulated pipes, and several pipes labeled 'DRAIN' with green arrows. There is a small, tiled, octagonal-shaped basin or shower-like area in the corner with a faucet and showerhead above it. A red plunger with a long clear handle stands on the floor. A floor drain is visible in the center of the room. A white door with a gold-colored handle is partially visible on the right side of the frame.",
