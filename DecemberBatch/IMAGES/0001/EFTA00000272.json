    "description": "A photograph taken from a doorway or hallway looking into a bathroom suite. On the left, there is a marble-topped bathtub. In the center, a doorway leads to a separate toilet room (water closet) containing a white toilet and a framed piece of art on the wall. To the right of that doorway is a towel ring with a white towel. Further right is a large glass door or partition, likely for a shower, reflecting the room. The floor is covered in a light tan or beige carpet. The walls are a neutral cream color with white crown molding. Two recessed lights are visible on the ceiling.",
