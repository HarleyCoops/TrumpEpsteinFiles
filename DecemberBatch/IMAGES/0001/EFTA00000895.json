On the desk is a large Apple iMac computer, a desk phone, hand sanitizer, a small framed photo, and various office supplies. Behind the desk is a printer on a stand. To the left, a decorative guitar-shaped collage hangs on the wall. To the right, an open door leads into a bathroom with a white vanity and sink. A large drum-style pendant lamp hangs over the desk.",
