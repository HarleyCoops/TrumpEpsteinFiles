The bathroom features white square floor tiles, a white pedestal sink, a white toilet with the lid open, and a glass-walled shower stall on the right. A large mirror is mounted above the sink, reflecting a doorway and a light fixture from the opposite wall. A circular light fixture is mounted on the wall above the mirror. A brown wicker-style trash can with a white liner is positioned between the toilet and the sink. A clothes hanger is visible hanging on a hook on the wall reflected in the mirror.",
