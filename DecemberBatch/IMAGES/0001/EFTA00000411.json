    "description": "An interior photograph showing a doorway leading into a room. The door is a light gray color and is partially open, revealing a hallway or storage area. On the door, there is a small white piece of paper taped with some text and a black graphic. Inside the room, there is a hand truck (dolly), a row of white lockers, a small white counter with a sink, and a ladder leaning against the wall. The lighting appears to be from overhead fluorescent fixtures.",
