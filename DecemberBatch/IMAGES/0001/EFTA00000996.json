    "description": "A photograph of an interior hallway or vestibule featuring ornate, classical-style architectural details. An open white door with gold trim is visible on the left, leading into a darker room. In the center, there is a paneled wall with a vertical control panel (likely for an elevator or lighting system) containing two buttons. To the right of the panel is another closed door with a small circular window or peephole and a gold doorknob. The flooring appears to be dark wood in a herringbone or parquet pattern. The walls and doors are painted an off-white or cream color with gold leaf accents.",
