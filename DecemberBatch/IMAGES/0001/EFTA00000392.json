    "description": "A photograph showing a white door with a piece of paper taped to it. The paper has large black letters 'KK' printed on it, along with a table or form below the letters. The door is slightly ajar, revealing a dark interior room beyond. To the right, a hallway or another room with yellow-toned walls is visible. A silver-colored doorknob is at the bottom right of the door frame. The lighting appears to be from a camera flash, creating a stark contrast and some shadows.",
