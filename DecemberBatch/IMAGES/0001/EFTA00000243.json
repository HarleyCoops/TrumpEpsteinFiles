    "description": "A photograph showing the interior of a high-end bathroom. The focal point is a narrow walk-in shower with a glass door and chrome frame. The interior of the shower and the bathroom floor are finished with white marble featuring grey veining. A small chrome shelf inside the shower holds two bottles. To the right of the shower is a white paneled door that is slightly ajar, revealing a brass doorknob and keyhole. The lower half of the walls are tiled in white marble with a thin black border, while the upper half is painted a light cream color. A white bath mat is placed on the floor in front of the shower entrance.",
