There is a long, low banquette seating area with patterned cushions along the left wall. In the foreground, a wooden easel or stand is partially visible. To the right, there are leopard-print chairs tucked under a white table. A black fireplace with a framed portrait of an elderly bearded man sits against the far wall. The floor is covered in a striped carpet.",
