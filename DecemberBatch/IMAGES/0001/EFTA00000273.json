    "description": "A photograph of a bathroom interior. The image shows two open doorways: the left door leads to a small room with a toilet and a framed black-and-white photograph of a person on the wall; the right door leads to a walk-in shower with marble walls and several bottles of toiletries on a shelf. Between the two doors is a towel ring with a white towel. To the far left, a marble countertop is visible with a pair of pink ballet slippers hanging on the wall above it. To the far right, another marble countertop with a sink and a mirror is visible. The floor appears to be marble tile in the toilet and shower areas, and carpet in the foreground.",
