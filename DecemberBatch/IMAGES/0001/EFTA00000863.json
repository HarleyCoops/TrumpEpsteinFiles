In the foreground on the left wall, there is a large painting showing the lower half of a person wearing red high-heeled shoes and a blue garment. Next to it is a smaller framed document or letter with a red border. In the background, an office is visible with a white desk, two black office chairs, a computer monitor, and various items on the desk including tools (yellow drills), tissues, and containers. Heavy beige curtains cover a large window in the background.",
