    "description": "An interior photograph of a small utility or storage room. The room features beige walls and a black-and-white checkered tile floor. On the right wall, there are two large electrical panel boxes; one has its outer door open, revealing a grey interior. Below the panels is an electrical outlet box without a cover. To the far right, a white shelving unit is partially visible with a roll of paper towels on one shelf. On the left wall, there is a small square access panel near the floor. The lighting is bright, likely from a camera flash, casting shadows on the wall.",
