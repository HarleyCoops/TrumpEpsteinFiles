    "description": "A photograph taken from a doorway looking into a small room or hallway. The room has beige walls and dark gray carpet. On the left wall, there is a white wall-mounted document organizer. Below it sits a large silver Rimowa-style rolling suitcase. Further back is a white desk or table cluttered with various items including what appears to be a printer, papers, and office supplies. On the wall above the desk is a digital clock. A black backpack sits on the floor next to the desk. To the right, an open white interior door leads to another room.",
