    "description": "A photograph showing a white interior door with a document taped to it. The document features large, bold letters 'AA' and a grid/table at the bottom. To the left of the door, a portion of a room is visible, containing a beige sofa, a floor lamp with a gold-colored base, and dark curtains in the background. The lighting appears to be from a camera flash, creating a high-contrast scene with deep shadows.",
