    "description": "A photograph of a workspace or control room. The room features a large L-shaped desk cluttered with various items including two yellow Ryobi power drills, a tape measure, a box of tissues, a laptop (MacBook), a water bottle, and various papers. Above the desk is a multi-monitor setup consisting of six large flat-screen monitors mounted on a wall. To the right of the monitors, there are several wall-mounted control panels, likely for fire safety or building security, with visible wiring conduits. A silver trash can sits on the carpeted floor next to the desk.",
