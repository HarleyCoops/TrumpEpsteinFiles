    "description": "A photograph of an office or command center setup. The room features a large L-shaped desk with a complex multi-monitor array (at least 6-8 monitors) mounted on a heavy-duty black stand. There are two black ergonomic office chairs. On the desk, there are various items including power tools (yellow drills), a box of tissues, a green container, and papers. A black backpack sits on the grey carpeted floor. In the background, there is a tall window covered by floor-to-ceiling grey curtains. To the right, a wall-mounted light fixture and an electrical or control box are visible. A silver trash can and some boxes are in the foreground right.",
