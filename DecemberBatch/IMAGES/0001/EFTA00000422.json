In the background, several cardboard boxes are stacked, one of which has the word 'Barrel' printed on it. A gray door with a circular window is visible at the end of the hallway. To the right of the door is a red fire extinguisher. A hand truck (dolly) leans against the wall near the boxes. The floor has a black and white checkered tile pattern. In the foreground on the right, a gray and white appliance or piece of equipment is partially visible.",
