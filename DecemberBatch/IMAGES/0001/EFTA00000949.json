    "description": "An interior photograph of a luxuriously decorated room. The room features a large mural on the wall depicting a stylized tree and landscape in muted, monochromatic tones. Below the mural is a long, cream-colored sofa with decorative stitching and multiple cushions. To the left, there are two armchairs upholstered in a leopard-print fabric, positioned around a white table. To the right of the sofa stands a tall, modern floor lamp with a wide, flat top and a small stone figurine. The floor is covered in a light-colored, striped carpet. A black power cord is visible running across the floor.",
