The bathroom features a marble-topped vanity with a white sink, gold-toned fixtures, and two wall-mounted sconce lights flanking a large mirror. The walls inside the bathroom have a patterned wallpaper. A dark bust sculpture sits on the vanity. The hallway has white walls with a marble baseboard and light-colored tile flooring. The door is a white, paneled pocket door that is partially retracted into the wall. A small white label with the letter 'C' is visible on a dark surface in the background of the bathroom.",
