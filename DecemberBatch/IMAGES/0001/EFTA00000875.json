The room beyond contains a dark countertop cluttered with various items including cardboard boxes, spray cans (one yellow, one blue/white), and other supplies. Below the counter on the floor is a black tool bag, a white plastic shopping bag with blue text, and some yellow items. White cabinets are mounted on the wall above the counter. The room has beige walls, white trim, and a grey patterned carpet. A grey rectangular object is mounted on the wall to the left.",
