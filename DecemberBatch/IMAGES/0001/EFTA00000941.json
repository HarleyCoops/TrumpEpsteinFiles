    "description": "An interior photograph of a room, likely a dining or meeting room. The room features a large wooden table with a white top, partially covered by a patterned cloth. Several chairs upholstered in a leopard-print fabric are around the table. In the background, there is a sideboard with a vase of flowers, a framed black-and-white photograph of a person, and a large circular gong on a stand. Two windows with long, light-colored curtains are visible, flanking a dark wooden door. A tall candelabra stands on a pedestal near one window. The walls are a neutral beige color with decorative molding near the ceiling. The floor is covered in a light-colored, ribbed carpet.",
