    "description": "A high-angle photograph of a luxury bathroom interior. The foreground features a granite countertop with a white undermount sink, gold-toned faucets, a white candle in a glass jar, and a bottle of blue hand soap. On the counter sits an ornate black and gold clock flanked by two small statues. A large mirror reflects the wall-mounted sconces and the opposite side of the room. In the background, an open door leads to another room where a large piece of artwork depicting a zebra is visible. The walls are covered in a patterned wallpaper, and the floor appears to be polished stone with a small woven rug.",
