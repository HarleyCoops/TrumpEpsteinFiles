    "description": "An interior photograph of a hallway or room. In the foreground, a curved wooden sideboard or console table is covered with numerous framed photographs of various sizes and colors. The wall behind the table features a light-colored wallpaper with a subtle, wavy, mountain-like pattern. In the center, a large, dark-wood ornate door with a diamond-shaped panel is partially open, leading into another room. To the right, a small wooden easel stands with a white board containing some red markings or drawings. The floor is covered with a neutral-toned, ribbed carpet. The ceiling has white crown molding.",
