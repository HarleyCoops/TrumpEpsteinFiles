    "description": "An interior photograph of a room with curved walls featuring light wood paneling or wallpaper. In the center, a tall, slender black sculpture of a stylized head sits on a tall, square marble or granite pedestal. To the left, an open doorway reveals a glimpse into another room where a black bag with 'FBI' in yellow letters is visible on the floor. To the right is a closed white door. In the foreground, a glass table holds several books and a bowl of red and blue lollipops. One book title is partially visible: 'FOCUSING ON PROUD REFLECTIONS OF THE 72nd UNGA SESSION'. Another book is titled 'MALDIVES'.",
