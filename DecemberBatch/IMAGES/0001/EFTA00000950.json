    "description": "A photograph showing a large, dark wood sideboard or console table covered with numerous framed photographs. The wall behind the table has a textured, wave-like or cloud-like sculptural relief. In the foreground, there is a table with a white and floral patterned cloth and a bouquet of white and green flowers (hydrangeas). A chair with leopard-print upholstery is partially visible behind the foreground table. The framed photos on the sideboard appear to show various people, including some in formal or religious attire (one appears to show a figure resembling a Pope, others show individuals in Middle Eastern dress).",
