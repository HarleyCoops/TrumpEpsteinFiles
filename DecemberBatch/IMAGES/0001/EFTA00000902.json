    "description": "A photograph of an interior room featuring a doorway, a tall floor lamp, and a large sculpture. The walls are covered in a light-colored wood-grain patterned wallpaper. To the left, a white built-in bookshelf is partially visible. A tall, rectangular, frosted glass floor lamp stands next to the bookshelf, illuminated from the base. In the center, a white paneled door is slightly ajar, with a white piece of paper taped to it featuring the letter 'B'. To the right, a large, dark, elongated head sculpture sits on a stone pedestal. A curved wall-mounted light fixture is positioned above the sculpture. The floor is covered in dark carpeting.",
