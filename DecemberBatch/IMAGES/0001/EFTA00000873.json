    "description": "A photograph of a security or monitoring workstation. The setup includes a large array of monitors: four large flat-screen TVs mounted on the wall above three smaller computer monitors on the desk. A laptop (MacBook) sits open on the desk alongside a keyboard, mouse, calculator, telephone, and various office supplies like tissues, a bottle of hand sanitizer, and a notepad. To the left is a server rack with an open door containing networking equipment. On the right wall, there are several control panels, including what appears to be a fire alarm control panel and other building system interfaces.",
