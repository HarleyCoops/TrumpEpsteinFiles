A white leather sofa and a matching white leather armchair are visible. A black rug with a white circular pattern is on the floor. To the right, there is a built-in white bookshelf filled with books. A mirrored side table sits in front of the armchair. A small black sculpture is on a pedestal against the wall. A door with a gold-colored handle and hinge is in the foreground on the right, with a paper labeled 'B' taped to it.",
