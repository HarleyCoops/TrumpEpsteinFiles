The floor is covered with a light-colored carpet featuring a repeating geometric diamond pattern. Three flush-mount dome light fixtures with brass-colored trim are visible on the ceiling. On the left side of the hallway, a white door is partially open. On the right side, there are recessed architectural features or window wells. The hallway leads to another doorway in the distance.",
