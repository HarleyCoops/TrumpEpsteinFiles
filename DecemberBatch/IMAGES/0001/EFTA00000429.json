On the left, there is a white front-loading washing machine and a white laundry cart with a fabric liner. In the background, a large industrial dryer is recessed into an alcove. To the right, a large blue piece of industrial equipment (possibly a flatwork ironer or folder) is visible in the foreground. A doorway on the right leads to another room where hanging garments and storage racks are visible. A black garment hangs on a white wall hook next to the doorway.",
