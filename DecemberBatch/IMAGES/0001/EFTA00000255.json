    "description": "A photograph taken from a hallway or adjacent room looking into a dimly lit home gym. A white door is partially open, with a white piece of paper taped to it featuring a large, bold letter 'Y'. Inside the room, various pieces of exercise equipment are visible, including a weight machine, a bench, and a rack of dumbbells. The lighting is low, appearing to come from a single lamp or light source within the gym area.",
    "layout": "The image is dominated by the white door frame and door on the left and center-left. The right side of the frame shows the interior of the gym room.",
