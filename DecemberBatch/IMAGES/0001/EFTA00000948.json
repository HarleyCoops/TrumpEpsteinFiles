    "description": "A photograph of a formal dining or meeting room. The room features a long table covered with a floral patterned tablecloth, partially covered by a white rumpled cloth. Several chairs with leopard-print upholstery are arranged around the table. In the background, there is a large mural on the wall depicting stylized clouds or mountains. A dark wood sideboard or console table sits against the wall, holding numerous framed photographs. Two doorways are visible, one on the left and one on the right, leading to other rooms. The floor is covered with a neutral-toned striped carpet. In the foreground, the back of a bronze-colored bust is visible.",
