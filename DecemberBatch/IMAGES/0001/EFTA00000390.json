The room features a black and white checkered tile floor and a drop ceiling with fluorescent lighting panels and circular recessed lights. In the foreground, there are two large white refrigerators on the left. In the center, a glass-top dining table is surrounded by four grey upholstered chairs. On the table sits a blue spray bottle. The background shows a kitchen area with white cabinetry, a stainless steel sink, a microwave, a large stainless steel commercial-style refrigerator/freezer unit, and a dishwasher.
