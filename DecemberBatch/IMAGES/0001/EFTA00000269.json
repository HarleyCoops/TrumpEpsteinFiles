Visible equipment includes a stack of blue exercise mats, gymnastic rings hanging from the ceiling, a wall-mounted pull-up bar with suspension straps (possibly TRX), and a tall wooden speaker. Through an open doorway on the right, another room is visible containing cardio equipment like an elliptical machine. A white sticker with the letter 'Z' is affixed to the door frame on the right. In the bottom left foreground, parts of other gym equipment are partially visible.",
