    "description": "A photograph of an interior room featuring a large, white, curved built-in bookshelf filled with books and decorative objects. In front of the bookshelf is a white leather armchair and a small glass side table. To the left and right of the bookshelf are tall, rectangular floor lamps that emit a warm glow. In the foreground, there is a glass coffee table with several large books, including one titled 'MALDIVES' and another with 'BALLS' on the spine. Above the bookshelf, a large, dark, tribal-style mask or sculpture is mounted on the wall. The walls have a light wood-grain or textured wallpaper. A white door is visible on the right side of the frame.",
