    "description": "A dimly lit interior hallway. The floor features a black and white checkered pattern. On the left wall, there is a large, vertical piece of abstract art or a textured panel. The ceiling has several recessed square fluorescent light fixtures, only a few of which are illuminated, casting a soft glow. The right side of the image shows a dark, reflective surface, possibly a glass partition or a dark-painted wall. The end of the hallway leads into a darker room or area where some indistinct objects are visible.",
