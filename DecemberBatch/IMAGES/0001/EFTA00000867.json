In the foreground, there is a white desk with several items on it: a yellow power drill, a red tool kit, two clear water bottles, a cardboard box, and some papers. To the right of the desk is a white modern-style office chair with chrome armrests. In the background, there is an open doorway leading to another room and a large mirror reflecting a portion of the room and a wall-mounted light fixture. A similar light fixture is mounted on the wall in the main room.",
