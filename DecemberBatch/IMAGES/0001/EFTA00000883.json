    "description": "A photograph of a cluttered home office or security monitoring station. The room features a large L-shaped white desk. On the wall above the desk, there are four large flat-screen monitors mounted in a 2x2 grid, with additional smaller monitors on the desk surface. The desk is covered with various items including a landline telephone, a box of tissues, a computer mouse, tools (two yellow power drills, a tape measure, a red tool case), water bottles, and miscellaneous papers. A black mesh office chair is positioned at the desk. A black backpack is on the floor under the desk. In the background, a lit wall sconce is visible next to an open doorway leading to another room with stone-like walls.",
