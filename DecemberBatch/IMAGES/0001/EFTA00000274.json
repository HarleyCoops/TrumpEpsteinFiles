On the left, there is a marble-topped vanity with two sinks, cream-colored cabinetry, and large mirrors with decorative sconces. A white towel hangs from a ring on the wall. In the center, an open mirrored door leads to a dressing room or walk-in closet featuring a white dresser with multiple drawers and a dark statue or bust on top. To the right, a marble-encased bathtub is partially visible with white towels draped over the edge. The walls are a neutral beige/cream color, and the floor is carpeted.",
