In the foreground on the right is a dark, high-back ergonomic office chair. The doorway in the center is open, revealing a white paneled door and a glimpse into another room. Inside the other room, a dark rectangular object (possibly a plaque or small monitor) is mounted on the wall. The walls are a neutral beige/tan color with white trim around the door frame and ceiling.",
