The sign features the large letters 'JJ' and a grid below. To the left of the door is a white wall with a small black sign labeled 'C'. Further left, a stainless steel utility cart holds various items including a black sandwich press, a red tool, and other kitchen-related objects. In the background, a room with a black and white checkered floor and stainless steel kitchen equipment is visible. A water cooler stands against the wall. The image has a timestamp/reference number in the bottom right corner.",
