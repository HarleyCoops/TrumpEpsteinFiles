    "description": "An interior photograph of a lavishly decorated room, likely a dining or meeting room. The room features a long table covered with a patterned cloth, surrounded by several chairs upholstered in a leopard-print fabric. In the foreground, there is a large metal gong on a wooden stand and a gold-colored utility cart holding various items. The walls are decorated with a mural depicting mountains and clouds in a traditional Asian style. A large framed portrait of an elderly man with a long beard hangs above a dark fireplace mantel. The floor is covered with a light-colored, vertically striped carpet. Long, heavy curtains hang to the right.",
