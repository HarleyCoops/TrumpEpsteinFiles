The shelves below contain athletic equipment including sneakers, a blue exercise mat, a black storage bin with labels, stacks of small boxes (possibly DVDs or supplements), push-up bars, and other fitness accessories. To the left, a large stone-like sculpture or bust is partially visible on a counter next to a set of white drawers. A black pole (possibly a weight bar or cleaning tool) leans against the shelves.",
