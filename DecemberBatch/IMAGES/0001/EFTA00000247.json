A large bed with a white duvet and floral-patterned headboard is the central focus. To the left of the bed is a dark leather wingback chair, a floor lamp with a brown shade, and a silver tower fan. On either side of the bed are wooden nightstands with lamps and various items including a telephone and what appear to be books or small containers. The ceiling is white with crown molding.",
