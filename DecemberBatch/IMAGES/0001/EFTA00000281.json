    "description": "A photograph taken from the bottom of a staircase looking up. The stairs are covered in a grey patterned carpet. To the left is a dark-colored wooden or metal banister with a light-colored wooden handrail. On the wall at the top of the stairs, two fire extinguishers (one red, one black) are mounted. Above them is a small black sign with white text. To the right of the stairs is a white wall with a framed object or window with a mesh screen. The lighting appears to be from an overhead source, casting shadows on the walls.",
