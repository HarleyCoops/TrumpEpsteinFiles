    "description": "A photograph of a high-tech workstation or security monitoring room. The setup includes a large wall-mounted array of four flat-screen monitors, with three smaller monitors on the desk below. To the left is a server rack filled with various electronic components, including what appears to be a network switch and multiple rack-mounted units. A black mesh office chair is positioned in front of the desk. On the floor, there is a brown cardboard box with a shipping label and 'REPACK' written on it. The room has beige walls and grey ribbed carpeting. A white curtain is visible on the far left.",
