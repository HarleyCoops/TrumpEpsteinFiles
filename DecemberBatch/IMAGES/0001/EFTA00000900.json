    "description": "A photograph of an interior room, likely an office or study. The room features wood-paneled walls with several framed black-and-white portraits. A white leather sofa sits against the wall. In the foreground, a glass coffee table is cluttered with various books (including titles like 'maldives' and 'OSCAR NIEMEYER') and a bowl of colorful candies or lollipops. A tall, rectangular floor lamp stands next to the sofa. To the right, a white bookshelf is partially visible, containing books and a small sign that says 'PLEASE Take a Number'. The floor is covered with a black rug and a patterned circular rug under the table.",
