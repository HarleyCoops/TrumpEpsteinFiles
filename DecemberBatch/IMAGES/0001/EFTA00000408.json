    "description": "A photograph of a narrow hallway with a black and white checkered floor. The walls are lined with large-scale photographic prints or murals. One mural on the right depicts an ornate, ancient-looking stone doorway or facade with Arabic-style script. Further down the hall, there is another dark mural. At the end of the hallway, several cardboard boxes are stacked, one of which has the 'Crate & Barrel' logo visible. A grey pedestal or counter is also visible near the boxes. The ceiling is a standard office-style drop ceiling with rectangular fluorescent light fixtures.",
