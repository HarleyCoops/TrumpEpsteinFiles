    "description": "A high-angle photograph of an ornate dining room. The room features a large white-topped dining table with a dark wooden base. Several chairs upholstered in a leopard-print fabric are arranged around the table. On the table sits a white floral arrangement in a glass vase and a long, patterned fabric runner. The background includes a fireplace with a dark mantel, above which hangs a large framed portrait of an elderly man with a long beard. The walls are decorated with a mural depicting misty mountains and clouds. To the right, tall beige curtains frame a window or doorway where a candelabra is visible. The floor is covered in a light-colored striped carpet. Recessed lighting is visible in the ceiling.",
