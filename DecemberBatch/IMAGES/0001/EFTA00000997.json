To the right, there is a built-in white cabinet or desk area with drawers. Further down the hallway, another doorway leads into a room with a patterned rug and a piece of furniture with a red top (possibly a stool or bench). The walls and door frames are painted an off-white or cream color. The lighting appears to be artificial and somewhat dim in the background room.",
