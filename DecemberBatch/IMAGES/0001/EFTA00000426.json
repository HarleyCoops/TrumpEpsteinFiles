    "description": "A photograph showing a cluttered storage or utility room. In the foreground, there is an orange rolling garment rack with a patterned curtain hanging from it. The floor has a black and white checkered tile pattern. Against the back wall, there are several large black electronic components or speakers, a small black Frigidaire refrigerator, and a white steam cleaner. A complex tangle of blue, purple, and white cables hangs from the ceiling and runs down the wall into various electronic boxes and panels. A grey electrical or networking panel is mounted on the right wall. The room appears to be a makeshift server or utility closet.",
