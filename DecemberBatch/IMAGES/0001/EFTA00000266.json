On the left, there is a large wooden statue of a figure (possibly a Buddha or similar deity) and a large wooden ballet barre or stretching rack. In the center and right, there are several pieces of white and tan exercise equipment, including a power tower/dip station and a Cybex branded back extension machine. A small green side table holds a stack of green weights and a white corded telephone. A window with white blinds and cream-colored curtains is visible on the left wall.",
