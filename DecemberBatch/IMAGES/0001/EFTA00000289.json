    "description": "A photograph of an interior living space. The room features white walls, white crown molding, and yellow-gold wall-to-wall carpeting. On the left is a cream-colored sofa with several pillows (one dark brown/black, one cream, one patterned). To the right of the sofa is a floor lamp with a brown shade and a stack of books on the floor. In the foreground on the right is a matching cream-colored armchair with a small colorful toy on the seat. In the background, there are three doorways: one on the far left leading to another room, a central white door with a small sign labeled 'AA', and a doorway on the right leading into what appears to be a kitchen area. A cat scratching post is visible near the central doorway.",
