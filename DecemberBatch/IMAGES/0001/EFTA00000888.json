A large desk with a reddish-brown top and chrome legs sits in the center. On the desk is an Apple iMac computer, a desk lamp, various office supplies, and a framed photo. To the left of the desk is a black office chair and a printer on a side table. A unique guitar-shaped collage hangs on the wall. In the foreground, there is a glass coffee table with several books, including one titled 'MALDIVES'. The floor is covered with a dark carpet and a circular rug with a black and white striped pattern.",
