    "description": "A high-angle photograph of a bathroom vanity area. The vanity features a granite countertop with an undermount white oval sink and gold-toned fixtures. On the counter, there is a black decorative container with a floral pattern, a bottle of hand soap, and a stack of white hand towels. A large mirror is mounted on the wall above the sink, reflecting a wall-mounted sconce light. The walls are covered in a patterned wallpaper with a geometric design. To the right, an open white paneled door leads to another room. A small woven rug is visible on the floor in the foreground.",
