    "description": "A photograph of a bedroom interior. The room features deep blue textured walls and a dark plaid carpet. On the left, a bed with white linens is partially visible. Two windows are covered with cream-colored floral patterned curtains tied back with red cords. Between the windows sits a dark wood bombe-style chest of drawers topped with two small lamps and a decorative box. To the right, a cream-colored sofa with patterned throw pillows is positioned against the wall. In front of the sofa is a large, square blue ottoman with fringe. A tall, silver tower fan is in the foreground on the right, and a dark leather chair is partially visible in the bottom right corner.",
