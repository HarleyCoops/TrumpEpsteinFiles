A large wooden desk is visible on the left, topped with a lamp, a computer monitor, and a framed photograph. An ornate patterned rug covers the floor. In the foreground, a large, reflective gold egg-shaped sculpture sits on a glass and metal stand. The lighting is dim, provided by several wall sconces and desk lamps. The ceiling is dark blue.",
