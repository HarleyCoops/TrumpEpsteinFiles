    "description": "A high-angle photograph of a lavishly decorated office or study. The room features dark wood-paneled walls with intricate carvings, a blue ceiling, and a large, ornate patterned rug in shades of blue, cream, and orange. A large wooden desk sits in the center-right, equipped with a computer monitor, two lamps with pleated shades, and several framed photographs. Two upholstered armchairs with a patterned fabric face the desk. To the left, there is a tall, ornate black and gold cabinet (possibly a cabinet on stand or secretary). A large circular mirror hangs on the wood-paneled wall above the cabinet. A gold chandelier is partially visible in the upper left corner. White curtains cover a window behind the desk.",
