The room features a white pedestal sink with silver-toned fixtures, a white toilet to the left, and a small brown trash bin to the right. Above the sink is a large rectangular mirror with a thick black frame, flanked by two wall-mounted light sconces. A glass shelf above the sink holds various toiletries, including bottles and a toothbrush. A small potted orchid sits on the right side of the sink. A white bath mat is on the light-colored tiled floor. Cleaning supplies and a roll of toilet paper are visible on the toilet tank.",
