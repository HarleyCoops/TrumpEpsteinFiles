A dark wood desk sits against the left wall, topped with a white lamp, stacks of magazines, and a small container of pens/scissors. An orange, armless upholstered chair is positioned next to the desk. On the wall above the chair, a white piece of paper with the letters 'DD' printed in black is taped. Under the desk, a green object and a pink circular cat toy are visible. A portion of a white sofa is visible on the far right edge.",
