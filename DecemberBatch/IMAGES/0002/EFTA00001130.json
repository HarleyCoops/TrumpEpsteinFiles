    "description": "A photograph of an interior room featuring an entertainment center. A large flat-screen television is mounted on a light-colored wall. Below it is a black and wood-trimmed media rack containing various electronic components, including what appears to be a laptop and a digital clock displaying '4:30'. Two tall black floor-standing speakers flank the media rack. In the foreground, a white pedestal fan is visible. To the left, a portion of a large grey and white object, possibly a piece of exercise equipment or a medical device, is visible near an open wooden door. The walls have a textured, glossy finish, and the floor is covered with a tan carpet. Numerous white power cables are visible on the floor and running along the baseboard.",
