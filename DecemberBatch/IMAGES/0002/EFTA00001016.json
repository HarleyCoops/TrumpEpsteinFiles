    "description": "A high-angle, interior photograph of a lavishly decorated room, likely a library or study. The room features orange walls, white ornate crown molding, and parquet wood flooring. On the right is a large white built-in bookcase filled with books. In the foreground, there is a blue-green patterned rug, a lamp with a large pleated shade on a gold base, and the corner of a light blue sofa. To the left, a transparent acrylic console table holds various decorative items, including a red accordion and several round, colorful glass or stone discs. Two ornate gold candelabras with white candles sit on the table. A doorway in the center leads to another room. A painting of a person's face hangs above the doorway.",
