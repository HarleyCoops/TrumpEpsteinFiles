Inside, there is a vanity with a marble countertop and wooden cabinetry on the left, a wall-mounted lamp with a beige shade, and a patterned upholstered bench on the right. The floor is dark wood with a parquet/chevron pattern. In the background, another open wooden door leads to a smaller room containing a toilet and a framed piece of art on the wall. A white piece of paper with the letter 'M' is taped to the wall near the bench.",
