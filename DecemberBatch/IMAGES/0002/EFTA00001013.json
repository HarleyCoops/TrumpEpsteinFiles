    "description": "A high-angle, wide-shot photograph of a luxurious, well-appointed room, likely a library or music room. In the foreground, a black Steinway & Sons grand piano is partially visible. The middle ground features a seating area with a teal velvet sofa, two white armchairs with black frames, and a small side table with a lamp. The background is dominated by floor-to-ceiling white built-in bookshelves filled with numerous books. The walls are painted a vibrant orange, and the ceiling is white with ornate decorative molding. Several antique-looking scientific instruments, possibly telescopes or sextants, are displayed on top of the bookshelves. The floor is covered by a large, colorful patterned rug with shades of blue, yellow, and purple.",
