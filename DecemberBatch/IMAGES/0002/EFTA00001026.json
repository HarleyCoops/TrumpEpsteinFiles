The walls are white with gold trim/molding. To the right, there are mirrored panels reflecting the space. A large, ornate wooden door with a central diamond-shaped panel and gold accents stands partially open, revealing a room beyond with a large crystal chandelier and a desk. A hanging lantern-style gold chandelier is visible in the foreground hallway. A chair with a blue and white checkered pattern is positioned against the mirrored wall.",
