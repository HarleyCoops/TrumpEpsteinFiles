    "description": "A photograph of a highly ornate, opulent interior room. The room features dark wood paneling, a blue ceiling, and a large crystal chandelier. In the center of the room, a large tiger (likely a taxidermy mount) is lying on a patterned Persian-style rug. The furniture includes a white sofa, a gold-colored coffee table, a blue velvet stool with gold legs, and a very large, intricate marquetry cabinet or armoire in the foreground. There are various lamps and decorative objects throughout the space.",
