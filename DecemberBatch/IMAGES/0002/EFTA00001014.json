    "description": "A high-angle photograph of a lavishly decorated interior room, likely a library or study. The room features dark orange/terracotta walls, a white coffered ceiling with ornate molding, and built-in white bookshelves filled with books. A fireplace with a white mantel is centered on the back wall, adorned with various tribal masks and artifacts. The furniture includes light blue velvet sofas, black and white armchairs, and several lamps with pleated shades. A large, modern geometric rug in shades of yellow, blue, and purple covers a portion of the dark wood parquet floor. The lighting is warm, primarily from the lamps within the room.",
