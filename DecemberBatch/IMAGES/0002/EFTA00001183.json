The image shows a tall white built-in shelving unit with drawers at the bottom and shelves filled with white storage boxes. To the left, there is a hanging rod and a lower white cubby-style shelf also containing white boxes. On a shelf above the rod, several black binders are visible. A yellow Kodak slide projector box sits on the floor. A small sign with the letters 'GG' is taped to the back wall.",
