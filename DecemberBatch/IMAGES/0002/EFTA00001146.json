To the right, there is a teal upholstered chair with a pink and magenta striped pillow, positioned next to a wooden cabinet. Two open doorways are visible: one on the left leading to a kitchen area with white cabinetry, and one on the right leading to another room. A smoke detector is mounted on the ceiling.
