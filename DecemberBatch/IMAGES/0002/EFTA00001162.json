    "description": "A photograph of a bedroom interior. In the foreground, the edge of a bed with white linens is visible. The room features yellow carpeting and beige walls. Against the far wall is a dark wood desk with a white lamp and various papers/books. Two bright orange chairs flank the desk. To the right, a large flat-screen television sits on a dark wood dresser. A white upholstered armchair with a round cushion is positioned between the desk and the dresser. A small white label with the letters 'DD' is taped to the wall above the armchair. A green and grey patterned tube (possibly a cat tunnel) and a red circular object are on the floor under the desk.",
