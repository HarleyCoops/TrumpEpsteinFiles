On the wall to the right of the hallway opening, a white piece of paper is taped, featuring the large printed letters 'EE'. Further down the hallway, there is a storage room containing white cabinets, stacked white boxes, and several large clear plastic bags filled with dark, textured items (possibly clothing or textiles). The lighting is indoor and somewhat dim. The walls are a light beige/tan color.",
