    "description": "An interior photograph of a sophisticated room, likely a library or study. The room features orange-toned walls with white ornate crown molding. A black grand piano sits in the center of the frame, partially resting on a vibrant, multi-colored abstract rug with teal, yellow, and purple sections. To the right is a large white built-in bookcase filled with numerous books. A window with cream-colored curtains and a Greek key pattern border is visible in the background. A large blue and white abstract painting hangs on the left wall. On the piano, there is a small white bust and a red book.",
