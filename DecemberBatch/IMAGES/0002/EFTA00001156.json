Below the shelf is a hanging rod with various items of clothing including dark jackets, a plaid shirt, a black puffer vest, and a white shirt. On the floor of the closet, which has yellow carpeting, there is a woven wicker basket containing dark clothing and several pairs of dark shoes scattered nearby. To the left, a mirrored door reflects the interior. To the right, an open white door with gold-toned hardware (knobs and locks) is visible.",
