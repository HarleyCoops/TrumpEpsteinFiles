    "description": "A photograph of a long, narrow interior hallway. The walls are painted a medium gray, and the ceiling and trim are white. The floor is covered in a light-colored carpet with a geometric diamond pattern. On the left, an open white door reveals a glimpse of another room. On the right, there is a large window with white framing and a deep windowsill. The ceiling features three circular flush-mount light fixtures with gold-toned rims and a rectangular HVAC vent. At the far end of the hallway, another doorway leads into a dark room where some equipment or storage is visible.",
