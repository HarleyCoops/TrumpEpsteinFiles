    "description": "A photograph taken from a doorway looking into a room. In the foreground, a heavy, dark wood-grain door is swung open to the left, revealing its thick edge and metal hinges. The door has a circular metallic plate around a lever-style handle. The room inside has tan carpeting. In the background, there is another white door partially open, and a window with a white frame and red decorative grid patterns. A dark rectangular object, possibly a trunk or piece of furniture, sits on the floor beneath the window. The walls are a light neutral color with a subtle horizontal texture.",
