    "description": "A photograph of an interior space, likely a bedroom and adjacent bathroom. The central focus is a blue-painted wall corner where a white evidence marker or label is taped. To the left, a bedroom is visible with a bed covered by a dark, textured (possibly faux fur) throw, a window with grey curtains, and a ceiling light fixture. To the right, a partial view of a bathroom shows a white sink, a bottle of soap, a mirror with a black frame, and a power outlet.",
