    "description": "A photograph of a bedroom interior. The room features vibrant blue walls and a bright yellow/gold carpet. A bed is centered in the frame, featuring a multi-colored striped headboard with a scalloped red trim. The bed is made with white linens and a grey and black faux-fur or animal print throw blanket. To the right of the bed is a black tiered rolling side table holding a white box, a book, and a piece of paper. On the table sits a Tiffany-style lamp with a blue and green stained-glass shade. Two brass floor lamps with red shades are positioned on either side of the bed. A white curtain with a blue wavy pattern is visible on the left.",
