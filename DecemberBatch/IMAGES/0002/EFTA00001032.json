The walls are paneled in dark wood and adorned with large blue and white tapestries depicting landscapes. A long, patterned oriental runner rug stretches down the center of the room. To the left, there is a wooden sideboard with framed photographs and a large golden egg-shaped sculpture. To the right, a table holds a lamp with a large white shade and a framed photo with a blacked-out face. The ceiling is painted a solid blue. Lighting is provided by wall-mounted sconces and a chandelier visible in the upper right.",
