To the right, there is a light blue velvet sofa, a fireplace with a white mantel, and various decorative objects including African-style masks and a small horse figurine. The floor is made of dark wood in a parquet pattern. Lighting is provided by a modern gold swing-arm lamp and a traditional table lamp.",
