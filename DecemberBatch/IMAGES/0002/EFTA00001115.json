    "description": "A photograph of a narrow hallway or corridor inside a residence. The floor is covered in a dark green, blue, and red plaid (tartan) carpet. On the left, there are heavy, cream-colored floral patterned curtains with red trim and tie-backs. A small wooden chair with a pink upholstered seat sits against the left wall. The walls are an off-white or cream color. On the right wall, three framed pictures are visible. At the end of the hallway, two more framed pictures are stacked vertically on the wall. Below the bottom picture at the end of the hall, a small white sign with a large black 'X' is taped to the wall. A simple dome light fixture is on the ceiling.",
