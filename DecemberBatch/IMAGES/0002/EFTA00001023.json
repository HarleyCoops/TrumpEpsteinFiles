To the left, there is a large mirror with ornate gold framing and decorative oval wall sconces. A small lamp with a white shade is mounted on the wall. In the background, an open wooden door leads to a smaller room containing a toilet and a framed black-and-white artwork of a zebra. To the right, a portion of a patterned chair or ottoman is visible. A white piece of paper with the letter 'M' is taped to the wall near the doorway.",
