    "description": "A high-angle photograph of an opulent, classically decorated room. The room features wood-paneled walls with a geometric pattern, a large ornate crystal and gold chandelier, and a dark patterned oriental rug. Furniture includes a white sofa with orange pillows, a gold-colored low table with stacks of books, a blue upholstered stool with gold legs, and two large antique dark wood cabinets (possibly secretaries) against the back wall. There are also two large circular mirrors or decorative discs on the walls and white floor-to-ceiling curtains.",
