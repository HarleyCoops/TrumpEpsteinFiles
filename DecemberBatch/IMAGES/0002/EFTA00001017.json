The room features burnt-orange walls, an ornate white coffered ceiling with crown molding, and a large white built-in bookcase filled with books. In the foreground, there is a light blue velvet sofa and a white armchair with dark wood trim. A large yellow and blue patterned rug covers the floor. A desk or piano is visible in the background with a white bust sculpture on top. Two lamps with large pleated shades are lit, providing warm illumination. A doorway leads to another room with mirrored panels.",
