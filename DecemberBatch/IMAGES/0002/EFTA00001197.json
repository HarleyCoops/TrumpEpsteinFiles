    "description": "A photograph of an industrial or mechanical room, likely a basement or utility area. The image shows a complex system of HVAC ductwork and insulated piping. A large galvanized metal duct structure is central, supported by a black metal frame. Several white insulated pipes with yellow labels run across the ceiling. A small electric motor is attached to the side of the ductwork. In the background, there are lockers and other mechanical equipment.",
