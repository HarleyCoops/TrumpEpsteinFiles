The document features a large, dark 'L' shape in the center, which appears to be a cutout or a heavy redaction/overlay. Behind this 'L' is a faint, circular seal. There are tables at the top and bottom for data entry. The image is slightly dark and taken at an angle, with some glare at the top.",
    "layout": "The document has a header table with two columns, a large central graphic area with a watermark-like seal and a large black 'L' overlay, and a larger data table at the bottom with four columns. A partial table is visible on the right edge.",
