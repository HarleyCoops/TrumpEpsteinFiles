    "description": "A photograph taken inside a room showing two large, polished wood-grain doors. The door in the foreground is partially open, revealing a black, semi-circular plate around the doorknob. The door in the background is closed and has a similar black plate. To the left, there is a tall white object (possibly a robot or air purifier) and a punching bag stand. To the right, there is a black speaker cabinet and a glass-shelved media rack containing electronic equipment like a receiver and remote controls. The floor is carpeted in a light tan color.",
