    "description": "A photograph of a small home gym or exercise room. The room has light-colored wood flooring and textured, beige-colored wallpaper. Several pieces of exercise equipment are lined up against the back wall, including a white pull-up/dip station, a white Cybex back extension machine, a silver weight bench, a black stationary spin bike, and a black recumbent exercise bike. A small white sign with the letter 'Z' is taped to the wall above the spin bike. A stack of blue exercise mats is visible in the corner on the right. The photo is taken from a doorway, with the white door frame and a portion of a wooden door visible on the right side.",
