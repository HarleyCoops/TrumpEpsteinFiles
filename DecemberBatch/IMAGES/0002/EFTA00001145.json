    "description": "An interior photograph of a living room area. The room features yellow/gold carpeting and white walls with a subtle diamond-patterned wallpaper or paint effect. In the foreground, there is a cream-colored sofa with a brown pillow and a cream pillow. To the left of the sofa is a floor lamp with a brass stand and a reddish-orange shade. In the background, there are two doorways: one on the left leads into a dark hallway, and one on the right leads into a brightly lit kitchen area with white cabinets and a dark appliance (likely a dishwasher). A cat scratching post and a small green object are visible on the floor near the center.",
