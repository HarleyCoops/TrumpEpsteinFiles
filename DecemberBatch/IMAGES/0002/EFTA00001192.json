    "description": "A photograph of a staircase landing inside a building. The image shows a set of carpeted stairs leading up to a landing. On the wall of the landing, two fire extinguishers are mounted. One is a standard red dry chemical extinguisher, and the other is a red CO2 extinguisher with a black horn. Above the extinguishers is a sign that reads '6TH FLOOR'. To the left is a blue metal banister with a wooden handrail. To the right is a white wall with a framed item or window. The lighting appears to be from an overhead source, casting shadows on the curved wall.",
