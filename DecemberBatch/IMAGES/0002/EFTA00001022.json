A large framed photograph of a tropical island seascape with blue water and green islands is mounted on the wall. Below the picture is a sofa or settee with a highly detailed, multi-colored paisley or oriental rug-style upholstery (red, blue, cream, and black). To the left, a doorway is visible, and a small white sign with the letter 'M' is posted on the wall. A white landline telephone is partially visible on a small table or ledge behind the sofa.",
