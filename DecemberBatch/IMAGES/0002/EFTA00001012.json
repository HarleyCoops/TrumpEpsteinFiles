    "description": "A high-angle interior photograph of a room featuring a black Steinway & Sons grand piano in the foreground. The room has orange-colored walls, white ornate crown molding, and built-in white bookshelves filled with books. A large, dark wood double door is visible in the background, partially open. There are several decorative objects including a white bust on a pedestal, a smaller white bust on a book, and a brass telescope on top of a bookshelf. A modern brass light fixture with two circular globes hangs from the ceiling. The floor is hardwood with a patterned rug partially visible under the piano.",
    "layout": "The piano dominates the lower half of the frame. Bookshelves flank the central doorway. The perspective is slightly from above, looking into the room.",
