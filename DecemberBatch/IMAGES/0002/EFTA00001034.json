    "description": "A high-angle photograph of a large, ornate wooden desk in a room with wood-paneled walls and heavy curtains. The desk is cluttered with various items including a silver Apple iMac computer, a keyboard on a desk pad, a black desk phone, a mouse, several framed photographs (some with faces obscured/redacted), a lamp with a pleated shade, a silver tray holding pens and small bottles, loose papers, and a yellow cleaning cloth near a spray bottle. Two chairs are visible: one with a woven back to the left and a plush chair with leopard-print trim in the foreground. The background features wood paneling in a chevron pattern, a circular mirror, and wall-mounted candle-style lamps.",
