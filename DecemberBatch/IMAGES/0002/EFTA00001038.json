    "description": "An interior photograph of a lavishly decorated room, likely a study or library. The room features dark wood-paneled walls with a geometric parquet-style pattern. A large fireplace with an ornate grey marble mantel is visible on the left. In front of the fireplace is a black screen and a decorative wooden object resembling a small sled or cradle. A curved, bright orange/coral sofa sits in the foreground on a large oriental-style rug with intricate patterns and a white fringe. In the background, a round glass-topped table with a gold pedestal base holds a lamp with a frosted glass shade, some books, and a small bronze bust. Tall, white, floor-to-ceiling curtains cover a window or door. Multiple wall-mounted sconces with small lampshades provide warm lighting. A red fire extinguisher is visible on the floor near the wall.",
