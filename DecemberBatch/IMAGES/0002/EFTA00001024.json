In the foreground, there is a marble-topped vanity with a white sink, a toothbrush holder, and a small lamp. To the left, a chair with ornate, multi-colored patterned upholstery is visible. The walls feature yellow-toned marble or faux-marble panels with decorative scrollwork. The floor is dark wood in a parquet or herringbone pattern. The doorway leads to a dark hallway where another door and a chair with checkered upholstery can be seen in the distance.",
