    "description": "A photograph of a bathroom interior. It features a white vanity with a marble countertop and an undermount sink. The walls are painted a dark, possibly black or navy blue color, contrasted with white crown molding and trim. A large white-framed mirror is mounted above the sink, flanked by two wall-mounted sconce lamps with cream-colored shades. On the counter, there are various toiletries, including a blue bottle, a soap dispenser, and a small round container. A circular magnifying makeup mirror is on the left side of the counter, with its power cord plugged into an outlet on the side of the vanity. A small black trash can with a plastic liner sits on the floor to the left. A white paneled door is partially open on the right, revealing a glimpse of another room. The floor has a light-colored geometric pattern carpet or rug.",
