On the desk are an open magazine (Cote Sud), a small brown sculpture, a box of tissues, a grey binder, a white keyboard, a white mouse, a desktop computer monitor (Apple iMac), a desk organizer with pens, and a beige landline telephone. A black office chair with chrome accents is positioned at the desk. In the background, there is a large-format printer (Epson), a small round black table, and floor-to-ceiling white built-in bookshelves filled with books and framed pictures. The room has light-colored patterned carpeting and off-white walls with crown molding.",
