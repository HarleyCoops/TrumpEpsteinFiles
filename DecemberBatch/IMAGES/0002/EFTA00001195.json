    "description": "A photograph showing a storage area, likely in a basement or mechanical room. Large white insulated pipes run across the ceiling. In the center, a long white table or duct-like structure is covered with numerous rolled and unrolled architectural blueprints or maps. A black flat-file cabinet sits against the back wall. To the left is a large blue mechanical unit, possibly a blower or HVAC component. A wooden easel or stand is on the right. The floor is a light-colored speckled tile.",
