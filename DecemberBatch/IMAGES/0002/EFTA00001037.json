The desk is cluttered with various items including a silver Apple iMac, a black speaker, a blue spray bottle with a yellow cloth, a LIFE magazine, a blue picture frame, and several lamps. Behind the desk is a large tapestry depicting a coat of arms and a landscape. To the left is an ornate armchair with a leopard-print pillow and a tall wooden bookshelf filled with books and small framed photos. The room has wood-paneled walls and a patterned rug.",
