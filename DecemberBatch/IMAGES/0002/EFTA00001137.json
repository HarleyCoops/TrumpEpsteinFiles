On the left, there is a white dresser with five drawers and a recessed niche above it containing a large stone Buddha head sculpture. The niche is lined with mirrors. To the right of the dresser is an open doorway or alcove leading to a walk-in closet with several shelves. The shelves contain various items including what appear to be electronics, blue bags, athletic shoes, and other miscellaneous storage items. The lighting is warm and appears to come from an overhead source.",
