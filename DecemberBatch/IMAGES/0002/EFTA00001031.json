    "description": "A high-resolution photograph of a luxurious, wood-paneled office or study. The room features ornate dark wood cabinetry and bookshelves filled with books and small decorative objects. A large wooden desk sits in the center-left, equipped with a computer monitor, desk lamps, and framed photographs. A patterned armchair faces the desk. The floor is covered by a large, intricate Persian-style rug with blue, red, and cream tones. In the foreground to the right, there is a large, polished gold-colored egg-shaped sculpture resting on a glass and metal stand. The ceiling is a textured blue, and a gold chandelier is partially visible in the top right corner.",
