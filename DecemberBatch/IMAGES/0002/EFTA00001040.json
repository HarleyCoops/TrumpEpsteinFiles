    "description": "A high-angle, interior photograph of a long, narrow, and opulently decorated room, likely a library or study. The room features dark wood paneling, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves in the background, and a long Persian-style runner rug stretching down a central walkway. To the left, there is a seating area with a white sofa and a pink armchair. A large table lamp with a pleated shade sits on a side table. To the right, a wooden sideboard holds framed photographs and a large, gold, egg-shaped sculpture. The walls are adorned with tapestries and several candle-style wall sconces. A large ornate chandelier hangs from the dark blue ceiling.",
